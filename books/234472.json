  "description": "“I can’t forget about that kiss, Elsie.” His hand comes up to cup my cheek, stroking the skin gingerly. “I don’t want to,” he whispers so lowly I almost don’t hear. His gaze falls to my lips once again.   It’s probably the alcohol that forces the next sentence out of me, or it’s the sheer terror that I’ll never be able to tell him how I really feel. “Neither do I.”  Elsie Archer and Hayden Jones have been best friends since they were four; the two are almost inseparable.  But that is when Hayden isn’t falling for a new girl. Elsie thinks her best friend’s only flaw is that he falls too quickly and too hard. She has seen him charm many girls and has cheered him on. Little does he know that her feel-ings for him have been growing steady for years.  Now on their senior year, will Elsie find the courage to tell Hayden what she really feels? Or will she remain in the safety of the friendship they’ve nurtured for years?   This young adult romance story will surely break your heart, but it’s worth the bittersweet hurt.
