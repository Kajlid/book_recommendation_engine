  "description": "n 1998, a 22-year-old man-child with a mediocre set of balls, zilch between the ears, and a mind-blowing alcohol problem placed the last of his worthless belongings into a dilapidated baby carriage, attached it to an even older bicycle, and decided to see if he could pedal nearly 3,000 miles across North America. With little more than pocket-change, he wondered about his chances of making it home alive. This book is not only the ultimate in adventure infused memoirs, but a dare to come paint on some spandex as an all-American boy turns into an absolute madman while trying not to die with every mile that passes. Saddle up and strap yourself in for a unique brand of humor as a journey unfolds through lands that will have you ultimately asking yourself just how in the hell this kid managed to forage his way through The Mile-Marker one young man's inebriated struggle to pedal across a continent and find his way home.",
