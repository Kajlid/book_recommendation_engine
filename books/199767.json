  "title": "Get Out Of Bed!",
  "description": "Best-selling author Robert Munsch has created this humorous story about Amy, a little girl reluctant to get out of bed, even when her mother stands her on her feet!What will get sleepy Amy out of bed? Not her brother's yell. Not her father's stern command. Not even her mother's trick of standing Amy up on her feet! So they do the only thing they can--they tuck her back into bed! Amy's father picks up one end of the bed and Amy's mother and brother pick up the other. They lug it out the door, down the street, around the corner, through the school yard, and into the school. Amy's classmates spend the entire day trying to get sleeping Amy through her school activities.",
