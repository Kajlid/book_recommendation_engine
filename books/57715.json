  "description": "Inspired by the Moskstraumen, tidal eddies and whirlpools in northern Norway which are real, the story is couched as a story within a story, a tale told at the summit of a mountain climb. The horrific tale is laid out by an old man who reveals that he only appears old - \"You suppose me a very old man,\" he says, \"but I am not. It took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and to unstring my nerves.\" The narrator, seeing the power of the whirlpool in the ocean visible from the mountain top, is then told of the man's fishing trip with his two brothers a few years ago in which they encountered the whirlpool.Librarian's note: this entry relates to the story \"A Descent into the Maelstrom.\" Collections of short stories by the author can be found elsewhere on Goodreads.",
