  "description": "Imbued with an essential American freedom and longing, Leo Cash’s debut novel Blue Graffiti follows the story of a young man as he finds himself a vital thread in the fabric of those forgotten. Taking root in middle of nowhere Midwestern America, and written through the lens of wild and blues-ridden romanticism, this poetically raw first person narrative is an intimate reflection on the love, faith, and tragedy that courses through the blood of America’s backbone.",
