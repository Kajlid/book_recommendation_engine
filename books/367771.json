  "description": "Equality 7-2521 explains his background, society & emigration. He exclusively uses plural pronouns to refer to himself & others. The idea of the World Council is to eliminate individualism. Some were burned for saying Unspeakable Words. He recounts his early life. He was raised in Anthem, in the Home of Infants, then transferred to the Home of Students. He was born cursed. Eager to think & question, he's unwilling to give up himself to others, in violation of Anthem's principles. He excelled in math & science, dreamed of being a Scholar, but the Council of Vocations assigned the Home of Street Sweepers. Equality is assigned as a sweeper & repents his transgressive desires. He works with International 4-8818 & Union 5-3992. International is tall, a great artist (only those made artists may draw) & his only friend (one isn't supposed to prefer one over others). Union, \"half-brain,\" suffers from epilepsy. He finds a subway entrance & explores it, despite International 4-8818's protests that unauthorized action is forbidden. The tunnel is from Unmentionable Times, before Anthem's creation. During daily play periods, he leaves the community to enter the tunnel to perform experiments. Working by a field outside the City, Equality falls in love with Liberty 5-3000, whom he names \"The Golden One.\" Liberty names him \"The Unconquered.\" Continuing scientific work, he rediscovers electricity & light bulbs. He plans to take his inventions to the World Council of Scholars, so they'll see his talent & let him work with them. He's still motivated to aid others. His absence from the Home of Street Sweepers noticed, he's arrested & sent to the Palace of Corrective Detention. After escaping, he walks in on the Council of Scholars & presents his work. They reject it because it wasn't authorized & threatens social equilibrium. When they try to destroy his invention, he takes it, fleeing to the forest. Entering the Uncharted Forest, Equality realizes freedom. He no longer must wake up with his brothers to sweep. He can 'rise, or run, or leap or fall down again.' He isn't stricken with the sense he'll die at the fangs of beasts as a result of transgression. He develops new understanding. The 2nd day in the forest, Equality stumbles upon the Golden One, Liberty, who's followed him. They embrace, try to express feelings. They don't know how to think of themselves as individuals. They find a mountain house from the Unmentionable Times & move there. While reading in the library, they discover the Unspeakable Word, one carrying the death penalty: \"I.\" Recognizing the individuality it expresses, they give themselves new names from books: Equality becomes Prometheus. Liberty Gaea. At the end, Prometheus talks of the past, wonders how men could give up individuality & plans a future in which they'll regain it.",
