  "description": "A Baltimore police officer awakens in his car, sitting atop a chunk of road in the middle of a cornfield. For the next several hours, he fights his way through strange creatures, meets up with odd companions and comes under siege by terrifying beasts. Giant spheres of land dot the farm and great scoops of earth have been taken away. Animals that should not exist hunt the officer and his fellow survivors. Where is he? Where did these things come from? How can he get home? One man knows the answers but there's more he's not telling. \"Displaced\" is an action-packed, sci-fi mystery that will keep you turning the page until the very end.",
