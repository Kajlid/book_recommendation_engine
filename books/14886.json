What the hell kind of answer is that?\"\"The only answer you're getting right now. And watch your mouth. I know your mom taught you better.\"\"Didn't your mom teach you that kidnapping is a felony?\" she shot back and slapped the window again.\"If you break my window it's going to seriously piss me off, Allie.\"\"Well, guess what? I'm already pissed.\" Slap. Her hand connected with the glass again and again. \"Maybe you should have taken that into account when you abducted me, Clint.\"She nearly fell out of her seat as he swerved the car to the side of the road.Was he going to let her go? Leave her stuck on some random back road? Hell, she didn't care, she'd hike her way back to her car if she had to.He climbed out of the vehicle and came around her side, wrenching open the door.\"Get out.\"Relief flooded through her. He was letting her go. Finally. She scooted out the door, making the jump down to the ground and smoothing her dress back down her thighs.\"Well, it's about time you came to your senses--oh!\"He jerked her hard against him, both of her wrists in one of his massive hands.\"Maybe I didn't make myself clear,\" he murmured, his gaze full of determination and something else...something hot. Something that sent a jolt of heat straight from her stomach to between her legs.Her pulse quickened and she dragged in a shuddering breath, tugging at her hands.\"Have you gone completely insane?\" she whispered.\"Maybe.\" His lips twisted, his gaze roving over her face. \"Or maybe I'm just willing to go to any lengths to make sure you don't break up Kenneth's wedding.\"\"I'm not...\" She ran her tongue over her suddenly dry lips.",
