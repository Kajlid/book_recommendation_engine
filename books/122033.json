A stupidly gorgeous and wildly talented venture capitalist named Dallas Evener. I was the fiery yin to his dominant yang. He set my entrepreneurial heart aflame. Our destiny was clear as day … and then he had to go and ruin it. I swore never to do business with him. A decade later, I’m eating my words. A scandal rocks my startup passion project and I’m left in a lurch when the lead investor backs out. My only hope for money? Dallas. But that means I play by his rules. And the whispers around town imply he funds his projects with dirty cash. Is that why we fly to Argentina to close the deal with a mysterious financier? Dallas promises this is a no-brainer, although nothing comes risk-free. I’ll take a chance with my company. The question is, do I put my heart on the line again when our simmering chemistry reignites? Because there is more to this transaction than meets the eye. And everything I thought I knew about Dallas and love tangles into a compromising position neither of us expects.The epic finale to the Hustlers Series is a full-length enemies-to-lovers dark romance, buzzing with spicy friction and steamy second chances. A happily ever after guaranteed.",
