  "description": "After being invited to his wife's Christmas party, Lieutenant McLean found himself in the middle of a terrorist attack, where the party was being held inside a huge tower block. Hour after hour, then bad guy after bad guy, McLean took the terrorist organisation down and eventually saved the day, throwing the leader out of a window on the top floor.Now follow Lieutenant McLean's journey, where his heroics are rewarded by the threat of divorce from his loving wife, and he finds himself running around an airport shooting bad guys once again, waiting for her plane to land. This is the comical parody of Die Hard 2 and 3, where McLean finds himself fighting on the wing of a plane, wishing the fu$king aircraft would stop moving on the runway... Then him chasing riddle worthy bombs around New York, trying not to get himself into a racist battle, with his not so friendly Samaritan friend. “Yippie, dippy, doo” says the Lieutenant, without much of a clue.",
