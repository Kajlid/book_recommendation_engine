  "description": "I know why I was taken.How much does that change things? I cannot say. I still have a weakness for Jeremy when he is Jeremy. But when he's Stonehart? Well, that's when all of my hatred comes back.I have to make myself detached, indifferent, and emotionally removed to make the proper decision on what to do next. Jeremy makes detachment hard. Stonehart makes it easy.What side of him will I get? I don't know. Only one thing's for sure: right now, I'm in the poker game of my life... against the best player in the world.We'll see who blinks first.",
