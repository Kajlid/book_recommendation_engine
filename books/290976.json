Unruly magic.\n \nNo one asked about what dwells under the mountains in the west, and no one thought to wake it up. . .\n  The shifters of the mountains are haunted, cursed, with a plague that turns them into bloodthirsty, wild beasts.  To combat the curse, Lord Nodin—self-proclaimed leader of the shifters—blackmails Tor Lir and Citrine into helping him save his people.  During the onset of winter they travel to Stronghold, which lies deep in the Cascade Mountains.  But the moment Tor Lir and Citrine enter the land of ice and snow, doom haunts their steps.  The shifters have many enemies, and it turns out Lord Nodin was not entirely forthcoming.  Faced with treacherous adversaries, dangerous alliances, and twisted lies, Tor Lir and Citrine are forced to forget their values and face the darkness inside their souls.  Realm of Ice is book three in the fantasy adventure series: Legend of the Nameless One.",
