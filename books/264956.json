  "description": "Dr. Lauren Wright is a serious research scientist with blonde hair, smoky green eyes and a curvy plus-size figure. Too bad her closest relationship is with her laptop, where she stores all her most forbidden fantasies of erotic submission. Lauren has perfected the formula for NuBlood, an artificial blood substitute that is identical to donor blood. Nicolas Kris works for a vampire organization that needs the formula for NuBlood in order to \"come out\" to the world at large and prove that vampires are more than the blood-sucking fiends found in horror movies. He swipes Lauren's Mac, thinking that the formula is encrypted inside. What he finds instead is a code worth breakingâ€”the key to Lauren's heart. When they meet, it's hate at first sight. But a sinister group of vamps who don't want to be outed attack Lauren, forcing her and Kris to take refuge at the most notorious bondage/Domination night club in Houston, where the price of admission is fantasy and desire. In order to survive, Lauren will have to act out her own erotic scenarios with Kris acting as her Master while he does his best to quench her Secret Thirst.",
