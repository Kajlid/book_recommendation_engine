It is a dark and terrifying place, hidden from the world we know by borders that only the most unfortunate of souls will ever cross. James Halldon woke up in the dark, alone, without any food or water, without a clue where he was, and with no memory of where he came from. It only got stranger. James has somehow found his way to The Corridor, a midnight place that no human should ever see and the prison of a creature that has destroyed entire worlds. Somehow James has to learn to survive. But he is not alone. The lost souls of others who have drifted into The Corridor, and died, also haunt this world, and they have been waiting a long time for someone to come along. The Journal of James Halldon is a dark sci-fi novel that follows Halldon's struggle to survive whilst trying to understand the strange, dark, and terrifying world in which he is trapped. If it's dark when you wake up, and you can hear growling, then close your eyes and maybe it will go away. But maybe it won't...",
