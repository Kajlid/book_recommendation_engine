  "description": "We were doing each other a service; I’d spy on her boyfriend, she’d spy on mine. Everything is not what it seems, and seventeen-year-old Julie is learning that lesson the hard way. Matt is lying through his teeth at every given opportunity, and Julie believes there’s more to his secrecy than meets the eye; she’s convinced her cousin is cheating on Kara. And Matt is the least of her worries. Luke has been just as dodgy; he comes and goes as he pleases, ignores her calls, and is caught sneaking around with one of Oakland’s newest—and undeniably beautiful—residents.With no real certainties in her life, Julie enlists the help of a friend to help her expose the truth… no matter what it may cost them in the end.",
