  "description": "When Gretchen Swartwout died suddenly in 2006, Her husband of 54 years, Chuck, was not quite ready to call it quits. He combined his deep Christian faith with his decades of experience as an engineer and creative problem solver to produce this \"common sense\" analytical exploration of the idea of heaven and a life a er death. From interpreting scripture to testing the work of \"mediums,\" this book explores the afterlife in a way it's never been done before.",
