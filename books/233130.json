  "description": "Nico  My dreams haunt me. I feel as if I am falling into a pit of impending doom, but even that has not prepared me for the roller-coaster of emotions that flood over me when I'm near Phoenix. I have to keep my distance from her. I need to. It's the only thing I can do to keep from getting hurt again. Staying away from her proves to be a much harder task than I could have ever imagined. She's not only my assistant, she's half my age. She gets under my skin and irritates the shit out of me, yet, one smile, one laugh, and I'm melting into a puddle at her feet. Falling in love with her is a bad idea, a very bad idea because she just may be the one who breaks my heart for good this time.  Phoenix Nico is my boss. He's demanding, bitter, brooding, and a downright bully at times. But, all that doesn't deter me from him at all because I can see the kindness and compassion in his eyes. I know the secret he's keeping from everyone and why he's so guarded with his heart. I don't care about his secret, nor do I care that he's twice my age. What matters is the undeniable attraction we feel for each other. If only he can just let go of the past and see what's right in front of him.",
