  "title": "Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh, and America's Fight Over World War II, 1939-1941",
  "description": "From the author of national bestseller Citizens of London comes a new book-this time set in America-that examines the years 1939 to 1941, as Hitler's troops overwhelmed Europe while the U.S. watched from the sidelines. In Those Angry Days, Lynne Olson describes the vicious internal struggle that tore the country apart as Americans fought over whether or not to join the war.Lynne Olson's last book, Citizens of London, told the story of three prominent Americans who supported Britain during the dark early years of World War II when Britain alone in Europe held out against Hitler. Those Angry Days views these years of crisis from the American side, as the country divided into interventionist and isolation factions who fought in Washington, in the press, even in the streets to express their vehement convictions. Personifying this bitter struggle were FDR, in support of the British, and Charles Lindbergh, America's most outspoken isolationist. Their high-profile battles add to the drama and poignancy of this crucial two-year period of U.S. history.",
