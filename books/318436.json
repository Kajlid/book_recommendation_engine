  "title": "My War: Killing Time in Iraq",
  "description": "Colby Buzzell traded a dead-end future for the army-and ended up a machine gunner in Iraq. To make sense of the bloody insanity surrounding him, he started a blog about the war and how it differed from the government's official version. As his blog's popularity grew, Buzzell became the embedded reporter the Army couldn't control-despite its often comical efforts to do so.The result is an extraordinary narrative, rich with unforgettable the Iraqi woman crying uncontrollably during a raid on her home; the soldier too afraid to fight; the troops chain-smoking in a guard tower and counting tracer rounds. Drawing comparisons to everything from Charles Bukowski to Catch-22 , My War depicts a generation caught in a complicated and dangerous world-and marks the debut of a raw, remarkable new voice.",
