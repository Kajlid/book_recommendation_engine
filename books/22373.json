His band is starting to attract attention from major labels, which is good, but his own attention too often strays to the band's lead singer, Ziggy. Daron already struggles with being gay, he doesn't need a relationship with a band member to make things worse. He resolves to keep his crush a secret. But nothing stays a secret for very long in the white-hot spotlight of fame.Volume 2 of Daron's Guitar Chronicles encompasses over 80 chapters of the popular online serial (over 300 book pages), the most tumultuous year of Daron's life yet.",
