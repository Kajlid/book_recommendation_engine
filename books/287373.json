  "description": "Max Yoho's first language is \"Kansan.\" While he writes and speaks some \"American,\" he admits he is not fluent in it. If asked for his recipe for a good, full life, Yoho is likely to tell you, \"Get the bob-waar over the crick before midnight.\" In Tales from Comanche County, an old man with a hilariously skewed education in history and religion looks back to summers spent listening to stories told on the front porch of his Uncle Jack's Comanche County, Kansas, ranch. Cattle rustler Leepy Danfer lies amoldering in his grave. The Emperor of China has come to grief. A soft-shell Oklahoman met his make while riding a unicycle. Why? Yoho will tell you, \"They just plain didn't get their dad-gum bob-waar over the crick before midnight.\"",
