  "description": "From Michael Dobbs, author of the book that inspired the smash hit Netflix series House of Cards , Never Surrender finds newly-elected Prime Minister Winston Churchill in a personal confrontation with Adolf Hitler. The battle begins on Friday, May 10, 1940, when Hitler launches a devastating attack that within days will overrun France, Holland and Belgium and bring Britain to its knees at Dunkirk. Never Surrender examines Churchill's courage and defiance and his ability to lead a nation during three of the most crucial weeks in its history. Without the physical forces necessary to stave off German attack, Churchill uses the force of words to stand in Hitler's way, to show that no accords will be made. Dobbs is at his best in Never Surrender , a novel about the remarkable courage and defiance needed to save a nation at risk. Praise for Michael Dobbs, bestselling author of House of Cards , the book that inspired the Netflix \"Dobbs is an author who can bring historical happenings to life.\" ― The Times \"Dobbs has done a brilliant job in evoking the drama and despair of Britain hovering on the edge of the abyss.\" ― Sunday Express",
