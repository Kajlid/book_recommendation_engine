She chooses to tramp through the wilds of Savage Valley in the hopes of revamping her photography career. Trying to garner the attention of a more prestigious audience and desperate to capture the edgy side of nature, Elena gets more wilderness than she was looking for in the hunky bear-shifting brothers Joseph and Caleb Kinman. After meeting the shy yet intriguing Brit, Joseph and Caleb can't wait to make Elena their mate. But with a series of mysterious animal attacks causing anxiety in the townsfolk of Savage Valley, Elena and the Kinman brothers soon discover that something dark is lurking just beneath the surface. Will their love be strong enough? Or will the monsters that stalk through Savage Valley prevail? There are two different series in the Savage Valley, Colorado collection. Rugged Savage Valley by Edith Dubois is bear-shifters. The Pride of Savage Valley series by Helena Ray is mountain lion-shifters. Each book features a different romantic trio or quartet. Even though the two series take place in the same setting with crossover characters and share an external story arc, each of the series can stand alone. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
