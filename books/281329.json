  "description": "Family isn’t always blood. Daniel Archer. Alpha bear and only son of one of the four founding families in the friendly town of Seaview, Alaska. His responsibility, his legacy, is to find a wife, have children, settle down and lead the town as mayor. The only problem is, that’s not what he wants, well, not anymore. Not since his bear decided Will was his mate. Will Rivers. A human who knows nothing of shifters and who’s come to Seaview in a last-ditch attempt to save his relationship with his controlling, asshole of a boyfriend. Now Philipe is gone, leaving Will alone to plan a very different future for himself. Alaska is the ‘land of promise’, right? Will and Daniel quickly strike up a strong friendship, unwilling to take it further despite the growing attraction between them. After all, Daniel needs to provide his family with an heir and Will has been burned by falling for straight men before. Then, to the horror of them both, Philipe returns with a proposal, and he won’t take ‘no’ for an answer! Can these two hot men get over the seemingly insurmountable obstacles in their way? Does Will have a future in Alaska or must he return to Boston?",
