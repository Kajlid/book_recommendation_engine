  "description": "The fearless warrior has finally met his match . . . When Alyce Bunnock's father tried to marry her off, she fled, taking shelter at Everagis Abbey, donning a nun's habit, and renaming herself Sister Terese. But when Lachlan Sinclare arrives to restore her to her family, the safety of the convent is shattered. At the sight of the handsome Highlander, Alyce fears for her freedomâ€”and weakens with desire. Lachlan has been tasked with finding shrewish Alyce, but can think only of beautiful Terese. Yet with every forbidden touch, Lachlan comes closer to the truth. And once her secret is revealed, Alyce must choose between the independence she's always craved and the tempting man she cannot resist.",
