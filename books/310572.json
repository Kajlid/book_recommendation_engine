  "description": "Age Gap Romance Saga Most people will frown on a relationship between Dutch Owen and Marla Marie. Unless they were there from the beginning…Dutch stole Marla Marie Smith when she was ten years old. She wouldn't say kidnapped because she willingly left town with him. She'd even swear on her mother's life that she gave him no choice but to keep her. Thrust into a new lifestyle with Rachel and Skull, Marla fails to adapt to her new family, longing to go back home. Always on the outside, never belonging, she connects and relies on Dutch in a way that escapes her. With him, they have no secrets. She grows up trusting that he'll never leave her. Some will say he forced Marla Marie to love him. Maybe he had. But he needs her as much as she needs him. Riding for WAKOM Motorcycle Club, the open road is his home as he rides between the three chapters. The fallback of wearing the patch brings added risks to his life. But the biggest danger to his freedom comes in the form of a young girl. While he protects Marla Marie throughout the years from the world, his MC family, and himself, an unbreakable bond grows between them. Until he finds himself in a situation where he must set her free and chance destroying them both. —This is a saga romance novel that'll take you through growing pains, stubborn rebellion, crippling heartache, and uninhibited passion.",
