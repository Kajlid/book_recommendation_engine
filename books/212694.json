To marry someone like herself—someone she can go on a sexual journey of learning and exploration with, who also has no previous experience in such pleasures—contributes to her finding a degree of emotional and physical love that she has never before realised could exist. But that love will be tested by someone from her past with sinister intentions, jealous of the physical love she shares with her husband. Someone set on doing whatever he can do—whatever he must do—to have the woman he desires, no matter the cost.",
