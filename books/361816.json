  "description": "Two young people meet in a magic world across the stream and over the threshold from the everyday world where they have grown up. They do not know how or why they have reached the cobbled street and eternal twilight of Tembreabrezi, the town on the mountain. They know only that by returning there they will find peace and escape from all the dreary problems of daily life.But when the refuge becomes horror, and the roads of dream lead to nightmare, then there is no escape. They must choose now, not between life or death. And each must choose without any guide or explanation, without any help at allâ€”except perhaps from where they least expect it.",
