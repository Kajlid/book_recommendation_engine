  "description": "So not your usual post-apocalyptic, clone vs. hybrid romance-adventure…ebook version now includes a sneak peek at Book ReturnBrilliant, brave, determined, and just a little bit…distracted. Meet Dr. Mina Brice, dedicated savior of species, and scientist with a secret. On a planet ravaged by climate change, her ability to mind-meld with earth’s imperiled beasts has made her a valued member of a team dedicated to saving as many as they can from extinction. Unfortunately, Mina’s inability to connect with her fellow humans has kept most of them at arm's length. Except for Jack—handsome, dashing-with-a-touch -of-goofy, totally distracting Jack. Dr. Jack MacConnell was never supposed to be part of Mina’s game plan. But when thrown together on a crazy-dangerous mission, both fate and a deadly tsunami seem determined to propel them down the same fraught—and occasionally delicious—path. Perhaps forever?But forever turns out to be a fluid commodity when both awaken 500 years into the future in a city called Origin. Presided over by aliens known as The Travelers, it is a world at once familiar and totally strange. And for Mina and Jack, it will become a battleground…against a hybrid race of predators loosed on the human population, against those whose dark side is so very carefully hidden, and even, as fate throws a heart wrenching twist their way, against…each other?Corrie Brundage kicks off The Eaters trilogy with an intoxicating tale of pulse-pounding action for fans of urban fantasy and science fiction to devour and savor.",
