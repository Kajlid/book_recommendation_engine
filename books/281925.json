  "description": "A mysterious vision sends P.I. Jude Byrne into a near-frenzy. The skinwalker who killed his father is about to strike again. With his family in danger, Jude knows he must return to the Navajo reservation where he was raised to confront the killer head on.  Psychic Copeland Forbes is a stranger in a strange land. He doesn’t know much about the Navajo culture or his place in Jude’s family. What he does know is that his gifts aren’t welcome, even though the spirits trying to speak to him may hold the key to the killer’s identity.  As the investigation progresses, there’s something niggling at the back of Jude’s mind, a shadowy memory that could stop this evil in its tracks. Can Jude recover this ghost of a memory in time, or will the killer claim his next innocent victim?",
