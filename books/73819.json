  "description": "Heath Teller stood in front of his window nightly, as if he knew Jade Watkins was spying on him, purposely taunting her carnal desires. She craved the sight of him, secretly giving in to the demands of her body. But was it really secret? Maybe Heath knew from the start what Jade did behind the curtains of her room as she watched him. Maybe he liked it and wanted more. Maybe it was a game to him, the kind she was all too willing to play. Maybe, all along, it was his game of seduction.",
