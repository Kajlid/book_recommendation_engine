Worst case, I’d spend the night with a fan. Best-case scenario, she would be hot. What I wasn’t expecting was for my dream girl to be the highest bidder.For years, she brushed me off, and now, I finally had a chance to take her out and show her who I really was.With only one shot at this, I really hoped I didn’t mess it up.LaylaAt the top of my career, I was riding the wave of my sports talk show having the best rating on the radio.I also made it a rule to never date any sports players.It was my one rule, and I was sticking to it until I bid on the only man who gets under my skin.All it takes is one touch, one night, one kiss, and only one chance.",
