  "description": "Imagine having a travel guide for your own life and a faithful companion to take the journey with you. Therapist and teacher Doniella Boaz has created just such a travel guide, one which takes a holistic approach by integrating mind, body and spirit. From the formation of attitudes and behaviors in early childhood to the exploration of how parents, experiences and cultural expectations shape us, Journey with Your Spirit Child allows travelers to explore their own inner topography within a structured framework. Personal anecdotes, poems, parables and mediations gently guide readers toward a deeper understanding of their personal psyche. Ample space in this oversized paperback is included for writing exercises and responses to the text. Journey with Your Spirit Child is a balanced and positive approach to wholeness. Empowerment and self-worth await readers at the journey's end.",
