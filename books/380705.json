  "description": "Flight 1049 from New York, NY to Milan, Italy experiences mechanical and guidance failure, and goes down in the Atlantic. Six passengers survive and find themselves on an uncharted island. They survived the crash, but must now learn to survive the harshness of the island, the elements from Mother Nature, and the differing personalities of the others. The family and friends of those lost on Flight 1049 come together for support, forming the 1049 Club - a help to those left behind who have lost parents or breadwinners. The 1049 Club also finances flights to continue the search for those missing after the authorities have given up. Can those on the island find new family and loved ones amongst their fellow survivors? Can those left behind find new life, new loves and continue on in spite of the void made by the loss of their loved ones? How long will those seeking survivors continue to have hope?",
