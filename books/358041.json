  "description": "An unexplained drowning...a muddy fall. A chain of unexpected events, a discovery and an ancient secret threaten the future. The story begins with a rainy funeral in Dublin in 1912. It tells how a very traditional, Western Irish sheep raising family learn of a secret holding them to their land and to an ancient promise. In the process of unexpected discovery they must put aside personal insecurities and failings and open up their lives to defend themselves. A devious plan hatched by a greedy academic attempts to reveal their secret to the world for his own gain. This they must prevent at all cost. Their good humored manner of removing obstacles, both figurative and solid, reminds the reader that not all sources of strength are apparent. Despite loss and fear, they learn that help can come from sources seen and unseen, as they discover their place in the greater world. Listed as an Awesome Indie title, and recipient of the 2013 Book Reader's Appreciation Medallion. Be sure to follow the O'Deirg family's adventures in The Gatekeepers, the sequel, published 2010",
