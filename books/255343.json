  "description": "This book is a rocket ride from my childhood to the end of my dreams. The road has many pot holes filled with gut wrenching laughter and spiced with the bitter sweet memories of lost friendships. The road is not paved with gold but the black tears of unfinished lives. There are forks in the road that lead to complete terror and others to utter joy. It is at times impossible to separate the two; it is at times insanity. This is not a tale of a life well planned but one of being bucked off and climbing back on. It sometimes runs amok, but these friendships are made to be bent, never broken. Some of these friendships were forged in the fires of the hell called Vietnam. The best and worst things on life's road are those not expected. They can bring absolute joy and crushing sadness. So strap yourself to a chair and take a roller coaster ride with Pineapple, Woody, Mikey, Nick, and the wacky Nolans and all the others who climb aboard.",
