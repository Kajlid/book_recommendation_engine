  "description": "Trouble seems to follow Buzz Miller, and this time it finds her outside the town of White Bass Lake, Wisconsin, where the dead body of a neighbor woman turns up stashed under her mother's house! The retired detective is reluctantly roped into finding out \"who dunnit.\" In order to snag the bad guy, Buzz, along with her Biology teacher sister Mag, \"The Maggot\" Miller, have only to find the murderer by following the trail of a dead horse, uncovering the illegal importation of rare plants, breaking up an international drug trafficking ring, uncovering a designer drug lab, and avoid being bumped off by the bad guys. Simple enough, right? That is, until her mom's wacky \"Geriatric S.W.A.T. Team\" cronies turn the crime scene into a neighborhood barbeque and Buzz's 160 pound Newfoundland chews up most of her initial investigation! After a shoot out at the Not-So-OK-Corral, Buzz has to explain to Sheriff Green why his only solid suspect was now pushing up daisies while lying dead in the petunias",
