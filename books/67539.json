  "description": "Many years ago, I was asked by the original publisher of the Mediator series (back when I was writing it under the name Jenny Carroll) to write a short story for their teen magazine, Pulse, about Suze Simon, the heroine of the series. Here, at last, is that long lost short story, which appears chronologically between the books Reunion and Darkest Hour. Enjoy!",
