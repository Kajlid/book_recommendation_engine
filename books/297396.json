  "description": "Perfect for story time, \n\nNew York Times Book Review \n\neditor Pamela Paul's funny and charming story about books, pets, and reading together will enchant readers of all ages. \nThis spunky, self-assured cat has always loved Rectangle Time--when the boy and the man he lives with curl up with their rectangle and read aloud from it. The cat knows how helpful he is during Rectangle Time, of course--his presence is vital to the very ritual! But when the rectangle starts to get smaller, the stories start to get quieter, and worst of all, the boy no longer needs the cat's help, the cat must find a way to reclaim his part in Rectangle Time, even if slightly different from before.In this fun, funny, and ultimately sweet story about growing up, embracing change, and the ways we all can misread social cues, we see the power of stories to bring everyone together--there's always room for everyone at story time.Praise for \nRectangle Time\n The story subtly celebrates the pleasures of being read to and of growing toward reading independence. . . . A good option to hand educators needing to teach inference and for lovers of silly cats. --\nSLJ\nA sweet story about falling in love with reading. --\nKirkus\nComforting . . . clever. --\nPublishers Weekly\nThis readaloud is sure to become a read-along as the listener's own literacy and vocabulary skills increase. --\nBCCB\nTruly delightful . . . kids will giggle over the familiar feline antics. --\nBooklist",
