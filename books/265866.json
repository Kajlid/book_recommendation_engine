  "description": "Being in relationships with three men is a whole new field of play.  My life recently has been one giant Hail Mary—not least of all my football team’s surprising move into post-season games. I thought the worst was over when the three players I’m interested in—Andre, Clancy, and Rodney—ran off my ex-boyfriend when he showed up looking to rekindle our relationship. Hard pass. And not the football kind. A new coach, some sponsors, and a couple of hot touchdowns at home from two of my guys, and everything seemed to be falling into place. But now my quarterback is out of the game, I’m fumbling one of the sponsorships, and the third guy I want apparently has some concerns about the others’ time of possession—of me, not the football. And he really wants to see if he can score at home as well as on the field.  I'm going to have to bring my A-game if I want this all to turn out right.",
