  "description": "Dear diary, Once upon a time…There was a girl with long golden hair who had the bluest, truest eyes that turned white when she cried. She lived in a kingdom far, far away in a tower made of stone, but her mind was made of glass that she kept sharp as knives. Where her memories hid behind her darkest doubts.Her deepest thoughts. Her diary became the only thing she could rely on. No one saw through her looking glass. No one cared.No one tried. Until the villain presented himself as the hero in her life. He took and took and took some more. With no regret. With no shame.With no apology.The page never turned. Their story didn’t end. Tomorrow never came.  His life of debauchery was their journey to nowhere. She’d give anything to go back in time. To walk where she had walked. To see what she had seen. One step. One breath. One day at a time. Though in the end, “I love you” were just words. That destroyed us inside.",
