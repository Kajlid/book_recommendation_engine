  "description": "Chance knew love once—a long time ago. She died when they were eighteen and the best of him died with her. Since then his work on a ranch in Montana has allowed him to keep his distance from people and from happiness. Eighteen years later, he may be ready to start living again—maybe. He’s watched all his friends find love and embark on the next stage of their lives. Part of him would like to do the same; part of him would rather cling to the past. He’s hoping that a trip to the Oregon Coast, and a couple of weeks away from his normal life, might help him figure out how he can move forward and maybe even be happy. It’s taken him eighteen years to get this point, but a chance encounter on the beach will make him want to figure it all out in just two weeks. He’s come a long way, but can he really open his heart up to happiness—and to Hope?",
