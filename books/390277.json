  "description": "One year has gone by since Darcy Pennington's life changed forever. A year ago she'd thought that magic only existed in fairy tales. A year ago the existence of parallel realms would have seemed preposterous to her. A year ago she'd had no real friends. Now all that has changed. It is the summer before freshman year and a return to Cedar Cove Family Camp also means a return to Alitheia for Darcy and her five friends. The return to Alitheia is bittersweet for Darcy, however, as her elusive purpose and uncertain future in the magical realm continues to evade her. Egged on by the boy prince she is supposed to someday marry, Darcy invokes the mysterious Oracle, an entity that can answer any question. In the end, however, Darcy may discover that the answer to her question is not worth the cost of asking it.",
