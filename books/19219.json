  "description": "Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea cycle has become one of the best-loved fantasies of our time.  The windswept world of Earthsea is one of the greatest creations in all fantasy literature, frequently compared with J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth or C.S. Lewis' Narnia .  The magnificent saga begins with A Wizard Of Earthsea ,  continues in The Tombs Of Atuan and The Farthest Shore , and concludes with Tehanu --each book a treasure of wisdom, wonder, and literary wizardry.  When she was still a child, Tenar was stripped of her name and family and dedicated as high priestess to the Nameless Ones, dark powers of The Tombs of Atuan .  This is the tale of the young wizard, Ged, who came to the forbidden labyrinth to steal its greatest treasure--the Ring of Erreth-Akbe--and stayed to set Tenar free and lead her out of darkness.",
