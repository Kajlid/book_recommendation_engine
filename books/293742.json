  "description": "When Maya Raymond embarks on a bold new life in the Florida Keys, she escapes more than small-town New England. She leaves behind her beloved father, Charlie, who still grieves for Maya's long-dead mother. But she carries with her the weight of her own failure to reconcile love and loss. As a fishing guide, she spends her days drifting with the tides, navigating the mangroves better than her tangled relationships. Will she ever set anchor, or will she continue to flee safe harbors for the distant horizon at the edge of the sea?",
