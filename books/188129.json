  "description": "Reed Haflinger and his aloof wife take an impromptu trip to Mexico's Riviera Maya, but it's not the reconnection Reed was hoping for. When she departs early for home, he stays at the resort, lost in what remains of a vacation he feels he deserves. But when a brief interaction with a beautiful female traveler offers a clue as to how to meet her again, Reed must decide whether to venture out of his comfort zone in search of her, or accept that he will always let life pass him by. In this mesmerizing debut novel, travel writer Ray Bartlett brings us a dark, complex love story as lush, beautiful, and unflinching as the landscape of Tulum itself, a place that you – just like Bartlett's unforgettable characters – will not want to leave.",
