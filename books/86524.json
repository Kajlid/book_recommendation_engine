  "description": "I was six years old when I lost my innocence. Keeping quiet about it was more out of fear of his wrath. When it was finally revealed, I was a drama queen, they said. At age thirteen, they didnt believe me after the gang rape but found it justified to send me away to have the baby. I was a drama queen, they said. Living in a family of dirty little secrets, I began acting out in a big way.",
