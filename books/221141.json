  "title": "The Tale of Senyor Rodriguez",
  "description": "What if you could be somebody else?It’s 1960s Mallorca. Thomas Sebastian, an English conman on the run, has taken a Spanish finca as his hideout. He finds the house untouched since the death of its last owner, the renowned and distinguished Senyor Rodriguez – with fine art on the walls, a library of books and cellar full of wine...Thomas slips easily into his new life – walking, reading and drinking; falling in love with his neighbour, the beautiful but impossibly young Isabella Ferretti. But when he puts on Rodriguez’s white linen suit and heads into the city, things get a little out of hand.''Sophisticated, literate fun that disguises itself as a romantic/caper beach read, and then takes the reader for a stroll along the cliff's edge. What a nice find.' – Pop Bop",
