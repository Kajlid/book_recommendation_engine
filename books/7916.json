Jayne Eyre herself has been plucked from the novel of the same name, and Thursday must find a way into the book to repair the damage.She also has to find time to hald the Crimean conflict, persuade the man she loves to marry her, rescue her aunt from inside a Wordsworth poem and figure out who really wrote Shakespeare's plays.
