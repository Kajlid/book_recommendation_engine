  "description": "The second book in the delightful Verlaque and Bonnet mystery series is another page-turning whodunit, this time in set in a small community of theology students and professors at Aix-en-Provence's university.  When the director of the theology department at the university in Aix is found dead, Judge Verlaque is dumbfounded. Professor Moutte was about to announce the recipient of both a fellowship, and his position as Director--which includes the coveted apartment in a 17th century mansion. The prospective recipients and others close to Moutte make up a long list of suspects, but Verlaque isn't convinced any of the eager students or desperate teachers are capable of murder, and he must dig deeper. With Marine's help--and that of her plucky mother--Verlaque uncovers a world that proves more complicated than university politics.",
