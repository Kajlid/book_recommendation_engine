  "description": "In \"Stop the Excuses\", Dr Wayne W. Dyer reveals how to change lifelong, self-defeating thinking patterns that prevent you from living at the highest levels of success, happiness and health. You may know what to think but find it terribly difficult to actually change thinking habits that have been with you since childhood. People are forever using excuses and defending those excuse patterns as if they were actually true. Such statements as 'It would be very difficult for me to change - ', 'If I changed, it would create family dramas - ', 'I'm too old/young to change - ', and 'I've always been this way - ' are all excuses that are used regularly without challenging the truth of these thinking habits. When you eliminate excuses that explain your shortcomings or failures, you'll awaken to your infinite possibilities.",
