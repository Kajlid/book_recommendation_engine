But when that abuse is directed at her children she finds the courage to leave her abusive husband to seek refuge for herself and her five year old twins, Tommy and Devon.At the age of six, Connor ‘Spike’ Stokes watched in vain as his fourteen year old sister was brutally raped and murdered. This event was the catalyst for a turbulent upbringing but helped to shape Spike into the man he is today, caring, loyal and very protective.A turn of events lead Louise and her children into Spike’s life but can she accept that a man would offer so much and want so little in return or will Spike’s urges to protect be too much for Louise? Could this be the event that helps Spike deal with his past but could it also be at the detriment of his own heart being broken?Note to readers: This is not your normal MC series. The Aces are an MC with alpha males but the members do not shy away from the fact that they are husbands, fathers and lovers with feelings. If you don’t like a biker who cares and respects his woman, then this isn't a book for you.I want to take the time to mention that I’m from the United Kingdom and use UK spellings.To receive the full experience of the Aces MC Series it is recommended to read the stories in the following order:Diesel – Book 1Duke - Book 2Paige and Chloe - Book 2.5 Spike - Book 3Amy - Book 3.5Locke - Book 4Jayden - Book 4.5",
