  "description": "Blaze Sonnier has had a bad year. In the spring she made national news while dressed as the Easter Bunny in a brawl where she was trying to defend herself, and earned the moniker Bitch Slap Bunny. In the fall the mother who abandoned Blaze for an acting career showed up on her doorstep, not only injured from an accident but broke and in need of a place to stay. While on a bike ride to purge her stress Blaze encounters one small (in physical stature only) silver lining with a flat tire.  The job Caleigh Breaux took after graduating college required her to live as a nomad into her late thirties. Weary of traveling, hotels and being unable to have a real relationship, she made a career change. Though she hoped the change would lead her to meet the woman of her dreams sheâ€™s stunned when it happens the night she rolls into the town of Falcon, Louisiana. In her latest romantic comedy, Robin Alexander has woven another tale with her trademark humor about small-town life, family, forgiveness, and falling in love. 78,900 words",
