  "description": "On her first day of college, Emily meets a walking, talking god. With a gorgeous face, killer blue eyes, and a body to die for, it's easy to see why Thomas Paige is the envy of every guy at Potomac Ridge University and why every girl within a fifty mile radius wants to get a piece of him.Sounds great, right? Well, it would be if Emily didn't think he was such an ass.Since she's not interested in becoming another notch on his bedpost, she tells him to shove it, and convinces herself that her novel use of the word \"no\" is what's got him hounding her all over campus. But there are two sides to every story, and Thomas is determined to make Emily hear his. Even if it does sound crazy and impossible.*Intended for ages 18+ due to sexual situationsGenre: New Adult, Paranormal",
