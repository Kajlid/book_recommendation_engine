  "title": "Professor with Benefits",
  "description": "From Bestselling Author Mickey Miller, a small town romantic comedy that will light your kindle on fire. I'm studying to be a sex therapist, and I haven't even had sex yet. Which is why I decide that Professor Hanks is going to be the one to take my virginity. I want Professor Hanks to be my dom. Hung Hanks. That's what they call him. All the students know Professor Hanks' reputation since he grew up in Blackwell. Small town high school football star turned Harvard Ph.D. Only in town to care for his dying mother. Too good for 'local' girls. I've done my research, and he's the perfect candidate for what I want. Hot, smart, dominant. Did I mention hung? Cole Sixty Days. That's all she wants from me. Not even a full semester. Rose Allison wants me to be her dom for two months, and then she's done with me. She wants me to show her how to be the perfect little submissive and then move on. But the thing is, sixty days isn't nearly enough for me. Once I get started, I have to finish her. There's just one big problem. She's a student. I'm her professor. Our romance isn't exactly in line with school policy. Sure, you've heard of student teacher romances before. Except this one has an ending no one saw coming. Not even me. **Professor with Benefits is a 60,000+ Standalone novel with an HEA. It gets down and dirty so enjoy!**",
