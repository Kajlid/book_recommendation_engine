  "title": "Runes for Writers: Boost Your Creativity and Destroy Writer's Block",
  "description": "The runes of the Elder Futhark were used by ancient Germanic shamans for divination centuries before they came into use as a writing system. Now, novelist and shamanic practitioner Marc Graham brings these tools of the ancients into the twenty-first century. Using a combination of cards, tiles, and dice, writers (and storytellers in any medium) can silence the inner editor and tap directly into the realm of the Muses, the Source of Story.Runes for Writers provides an introduction to the ancient Norse Runes and presents a number of practical exercises to tap into the creative unconcious. Using specific layouts, or runecastings, you can quickly develop character sketches, develop and troubleshoot scenes, even create a broad outline of your entire story.A companion to the Runes for Writers story-development system, this book is your guide into the fascinating world of deep, intuitive storytelling.",
