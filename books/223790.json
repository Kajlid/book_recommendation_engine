  "description": "The essence of communication is self-expression. The Writer's Voice is a unique and methodical approach to harnessing your creative energy and using it to write and communicate effectively and creatively. The Writer's Voice is about the joy of writing, for ourselves and for other people. A writer's journey is a spiritual, intellectual and emotional one. Drawing on concepts and aspects such as whole-brain theory, narrative therapy, Jungian psychology, and mythology, Dorian Haarhoff's workbook on creative writing gives readers the opportunity to move towards self-discovery. Stories, hunmour, illustrations, mind maps, quotations and cartoons inspire and guide the would-be writer along a potentially difficult path.The book is divided into two main sections, encouraging the reader to first create the text and then to craft it by applying critical skills. The text maps the writing journey from first inspiration to final presentation, following the writing cycle from chaotic imagining, through several drafts, feedback and editing, to final copy.",
