In Something for the Pain , Paul Austin―the ER doc you'd hope to get if something really bad happened―tells us, vividly and with uncommon candor, how, if you aren't careful, saving people's lives can make you sick.\"―Ted Conover, author of Newjack In this eye-opening account of life in the ER, Paul Austin recalls how the daily grind of long, erratic shifts and endless hordes of patients with sad stories sent him down a path of bitterness and cynicism.
