  "description": "Heaven O'Hare has only one thing on her mind, getting back on the road after a too long hiatus from playing music. For Heaven, playing in the Jezebels has always been her dream, but when their lead singer Jo suddenly decides to hang up her microphone for cowboy boots, Heaven’s pissed! It doesn't matter that Jo found them a temporary fill in or that his hazel eyes make Heaven tingle like crazy. The Jezebels are an all-female band and there just isn't enough room for a studly cowboy to be on their stage.Jackson Montgomery has only known how to do two things—ranch and raise horses. He's spent the last thirty years helping his family out around the ranch and never thought twice about it. That is until an impromptu gig at a local barn dance lands him a one way ticket to fame and fortune. Now Jackson is ready to hang up his cowboy boots and step into the spotlight. His only problem is a tiny, feisty, blonde drummer named Heaven who seems to be the only thing standing between him and his new future.Rock and Roll and Country collide in this new Montgomery Ranch book.",
