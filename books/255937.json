This has left the truth about North Korea a mystery to many people.Now, that mystery has been uncovered. Through years of research and studying the current regime, this book compiles information from both official and non-official reports, stories from refugees who have managed to flee the country and information from those who have successfully infiltrated the country and witnessed its truths firsthand.In this book, you will learn all about the North Korean government and events that shaped the country. This includes ‘official history’ and truths about all three of the leaders, Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong il and Kim Jong-un, major policies implemented throughout the Kim dynasty, and the techniques and propaganda used to ensure each of them has risen to become a leader following their father’s deaths. Some other areas that we will illustrate North Korea carefully protects its history, but this book uncovers many of its secrets. By understanding the history of North Korea, you may understand how the Kims came to rise to power and control an entire country. Through isolation, execution and imprisonment, they eliminated competition and struck fear into the hearts of those who would oppose them. With this fear and the admiration and respect of the highest ranking officials, the Kim Dynasty would hold its country under total power for more than six decades—a hold that continues today.",
