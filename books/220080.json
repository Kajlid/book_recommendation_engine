  "description": "Cassie Fayewood hates her life.Her father is always away working, and her mother is constantly nagging her to be better. Spending time with her younger brother, Dillen, and her constant college studies are all that keep her distracted. She wants nothing more than to get away and live her life somewhere else, be someone else, until something changes.A young man catches her eye. Tall, dark, tattoos. There’s immediately something about him that Cassie feels drawn to. Matthew Kale is your typical ‘I can do anything’ college guy, but something changes in him every time he meets her gaze.The warmth that spreads through her steals her breath away. And his eyes, so dark and inviting, call to her senses. There’s something beautiful about him, something angelic. Cassie doesn’t know him but the knot of familiarity—the tangle of butterflies she feels whenever she’s near him—have they spoken before?Their new friendship is thrown into chaos before she can find out.Darkness spreads through her life like a living shadow, and she loses everything. Having no one and no home left to run to, Cassie must escape with the help of Kale, despite the uncertainty that oozes through her.Time won’t wait for her to find the answers she needs.Neither will the demons hunting for her soul.",
