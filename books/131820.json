  "title": "Wolves of the Sapphire Sun: This one's for the wild ones.",
  "description": "Unleashed, sacred, erotic, otherworldly, palpable and serene. This one’s for the wild ones. The black sheep, the lost ones, the found ones, the ones who are loved, the unforgotten ones. This one’s for the wild ones. Designed to be read and pondered upon as a “novel-made-out-of-poems”, these pages will call you into certain depths and ask you to connect the dots wherever there are open spaces. You are impelled to feel and to think. And to chew on this paper until it runs through your veins.",
