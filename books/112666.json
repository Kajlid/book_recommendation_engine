  "description": "#1 New York Times bestselling author Johanna Lindsey returns to the dazzlingly passionate world of the Malorys, an aristocratic family of rakehell adventurers and spirited ladies, in a thrilling new tale of unbridled desires.Judith and Jacqueline Malory are not simply cousins; they are inseparable best friends. Refusing to miss Jacqueline's come-out in Connecticut, Judy convinces her parents, James and Georgina, to let her delay her London debut by a few weeks so she can accompany her cousin. Neither girl intends to fall in love during her first Season. But Judy's plans are overturned when aboard ship she comes face-to-face with the ghost who has been haunting her dreams. Unknown to the Malorys, deckhand Nathan Tremayne is a smuggler with a noose around his neck. Determined to carry out a covert mission in America that could gain him a pardon, Nathan senses that Judith is trouble. Somehow the minx knows his secret—and now she's blackmailing him into doing her bidding—teaching her how to climb the rigging and how to kiss. While passions can soar on the high seas, Nathan knows this aristocratic beauty is merely amusing herself with a scoundrel like him. When the unthinkable happens in Connecticut and the elder Malorys' hands are tied, Nathan takes command of a dire situation. Captaining his own ship, he turns the tables on Judy and steers them into uncharted waters, where a lady might just throw caution to the wind and give her heart to a scoundrel.",
