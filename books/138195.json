  "description": "Tobias is (or was) the Omega of his pack. Now that he's been given away as payment for a murder he never even knew happened, he's not too happy. Especially when the man he's been given to is Lucas, a mysterious but fascinating vampire. Faced with execution or obedience, he decides he'd rather go as far as loosing his virginity than die. It's not a hard choice to make when Lucas seems to have a strangely calming effect on the young werewolf, This 5000 word story contains tantalizingly graphic descriptions of vampire on werewolf sex, a dog collar, light bondage, and hints of D/s.",
