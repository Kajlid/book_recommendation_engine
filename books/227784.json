  "title": "The Impostor",
  "description": "A gripping tale of guilty secrets, betrayal, and racial tension, of isolation and revenge in modern-day South Africa, from the Man Booker Prize--shortlisted author of The Good Doctor. When Adam moves into the abandoned house on the dusty edge of town, he is hoping to recover from the loss of his job and his home in the city. But when he meets Canning -- a shadowy figure from his childhood -- and Canning's enigmatic and beautiful wife, a sinister new chapter in his life begins. Canning has inherited a vast fortune and a giant folly in the veld, a magical place of fantasy and dreams that seduces Adam and transforms him absolutely, violently -- and perhaps forever. The Impostor evokes a hot and cruel and claustrophobic world, in which sex and death are never far from the surface. Skilfully interweaving the story of one man's struggle to regain his moral centre with the disorienting, often tragic effects of massive social and political change, it is Galgut's most powerful and unforgettable novel yet.",
