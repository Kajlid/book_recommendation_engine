Without Hawk or Sensei by his side, Icarus is haunted by his own self-doubt and questions his ability to lead the sliders into battle. But when he’s captured and inducted into the RGM, Icarus must face his biggest challenge yet: keep his true identity a secret from the power that wants to kill him. While Fin roams the Irish countryside searching for Hawk, tensions rise between students in the Dimension. Desperate to escape the clutches of the RGM, Icarus makes a run for it — only to be captured again by a mysterious young corporal who’s been hiding a secret of her own…for the past 200 years. As the Anomalies prepare for war, the Dimension spirals out of control, creating more division than ever. Icarus is forced to make an impossible choice between life or death when he realizes that in order to defeat the darkness, he may have to become it.Resurgence is the thrilling conclusion to The Blood Race series by K.A. Emmons.",
