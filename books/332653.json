  "description": "My frenemy just asked me to help her win the man of her dreams.Easton: For as long as I can remember, I’ve been giving Hanna a hard time—and she’s been giving it right back. She’s the thorn in my side, the pebble in my shoe, and the woman most likely to off me in my sleep. And the feeling is a hundred percent mutual.So we’re both shocked to find ourselves on the same side of a helping Hanna win the heart of the celebrity forager-slash-chef hired by my family’s business to give summer workshops.It shouldn’t be a big deal. A wardrobe evaluation. A shopping trip. Maybe some how-to-get-the-guy advice. I’m an expert on matters of the heart—or, at least matters of the mattress—and for the first time, Hanna is more interested in hearing what I have to say than in mocking me for my Easton the panty-melter.But as Hanna starts to trust me and open up, I see her differently. She’s not so much blunt as refreshingly honest, not so much a plain Jane in baggy clothes as… deliciously curvy. And hidden under that spiky, steely exterior is a soft heart she doesn’t show anyone.Suddenly, the project includes ogling Hanna in dressing room mirrors. Offering her kissing lessons. And desperately trying not to give in to the sizzling heat between us.I have to let her know the plan has I’ll still help her get the guy she wants. I just need to somehow convince her that it’s me.A steamy, opposites-attract, enemies-to-lovers (or is it friends-to-lovers? So hard to tell with these two!), mountain man small-town rom com.",
