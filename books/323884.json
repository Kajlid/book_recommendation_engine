  "description": "Tess Burton is always up for an adventure. She's risked her inheritance to open Divine Vintage, a clothing boutique. While modeling an elegant gown from an Edwardian era trousseau, her mind is opened to a century-old murder. Visions--seen through the eyes of the murdered bride--dispute local lore that claims the bridegroom committed the crime. Trey Dunmore doesn't share Tess' enthusiasm for mind-blowing visions, yet the appeal to clear his family's tainted legacy compels him to join her in exploring the past. Aided by the dead woman's clothing and diary, Tess and Trey discover that pursuing love in 1913 was just as thorny as modern day. As the list of murder suspects grows, the couple fears past emotions are influencing, and may ultimately derail, their own blossoming intimacy.",
