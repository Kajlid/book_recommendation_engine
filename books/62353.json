  "description": "Fiction. When Tommy's parents abandon him as a baby, his grandmother Gaga takes him to her reclusive house at the top of Pike's Peak. Gaga's parenting methods are extreme, but Tommy soon learns her eccentricities are nothing compared to the rest of his family. As he's passed between his outlandish aunts, Tommy's journey takes him to the country homestead of Aunt Tess (who hides surprising objects in her voluminous hair), the four city houses of Aunt Penny (who prefers to communicate by ESP), and the cave-like desert home of Aunt Chelsea the coyote hunter. As his cross-country romp reveals how bizarrely different families can be, Tommy begins to wonder if the conventional home he's dreamed of might not be for him after all.THE TALL TALE OF TOMMY TWICE captures the unmoored feelings of young adulthood and the complexities of American identity. It's a dazzling novel about the ineffability of childhood and the nature of family and relationships in the increasingly rootless American experience.",
