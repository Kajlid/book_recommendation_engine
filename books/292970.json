  "description": "In the long awaited follow up to the best selling, Five Days, Another Five Days tells the story of war hero, Al Sokratis, who begins his day by being asked to be the Best Man at his grandson's wedding, only to end it in the afterlife after he is hit and killed by a texting driver while pulling a stranger from a burning vehicle. Because of the heroic way he died as well as the way he lived his life, Al is rewarded by being given the opportunity to re-live any five days of his life. They can be days he enjoyed and wants to experience all over again, days in which he had regrets and wants to make amends, or days in which he tries to help others and change the course of history.Another Five Days takes us on a tour of Woodstock, Vietnam, the NASA Space Program, and the 1986 World Series, introducing us to heroes and almost heroes, people whose lives might have turned out vastly differently were it not for the blink of an eye. Above all else, it is a love story as Al desperately tries to find a way to reunite with his departed wife.",
