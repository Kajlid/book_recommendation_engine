  "description": "Some girls seek fame, others have it thrust upon them...Clothing designer Kyra Felis has never been one to worship celebrities—she'd rather read good book or make a blouse out of anold tablecloth. She marries Hollywood up-and-comer Declan McKenna for love, with no inkling of how his newfound notoriety will send her life spinning out of control.But once Kyra reluctantly becomes a celebrity by association there's no turning back. And even though she has all the trappings of success, she can't do the things that make her happy—throw a party; drink a glass of wine (or four) at a quiet cafe; confide in her friends. When Declan's fame literally endangers Kyra's life, she starts to wonder, can she survive more than a year of living famously?",
