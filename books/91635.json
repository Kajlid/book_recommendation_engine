  "title": "The Other Side of Magik",
  "description": "There is an alternative to the universe we know and understand: a very close and similar alternative that is almost exactly the same, almost normal and familiar.except for some minor deviations. History there took a slightly different path. the DNA spiral is left-handed. electricity doesn't work. and magik does. In a world of steam-buggies and airships, windmills and gas-lamps, magik is the science that binds the fabric of society. A science that could offer a great future for its students.like seventeen year-old Garreth Royal. Unfortunately, Garreth has failed first year at the College of Mages and his future is bleak. Worse.there is a senior wizard, one Theolonia Crabbe, who has dark designs on Garreth. Theolonia carries within her mind the soul of her dead twin brother, Horatio, and Horatio needs a body to inhabit to fulfill his destiny. Horatio is a mandrake.a cold and fell necromancer of the worst aspect. But it's not exactly Garreth's body the wizard wants, but his opposite number in the mythical parallel universe.ours. that place where strange forces are at work and magik isn't. And the ancient and proscribed Book of Null tells how to swap them over",
