  "description": "When the person you’ve longed for your whole life suddenly sleeps by your side, how much are you willing to fight to keep that?  Jenny has a bad marriage and a long stretch of mostly nothing behind her. She’s rebuilt her life and likes what she has, but she’s lonely. Then she’s thrown into the arms of the only man she ever really wanted, and Jenny decides that this time, there’s nothing she won’t do to keep him.  Paddy has a grown daughter and a long string of ladies behind him. He has forced himself to accept that the one thing he ever really wanted wasn’t ever going to be his. Then the president of a local MC declares his interest in Jenny, and Paddy loses his ever-loving mind. Seeing her start something serious with another man one more time is not going to happen so this time, he’ll fight for what he wants.  Then Paddy gets a phone call no father wants to receive, a newly formed drug-cartel starts moving in, and the only way for them both to get through it all is by staying strong, and together.  Please note: This book contains crude words and somewhat explicit adult scenes. If this isn't your thing, then this book might not be for you.",
