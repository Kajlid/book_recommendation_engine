  "description": "Alexander the Great summoned Leon of Atrax to him and made known his will. A man was sought - yet not an ordinary man - to execute a vital mission for the Conqueror. It was a mission which would hurl a man across the perilous length of the world - a mission which would plunge him deep into love, yet even deeper into danger. It was a mission only a hero or a fool would undertake, and Leon was no fool.. And so it was that Leon of Atrax set out across the vastness of the empire of Alexander on a jounrey that would bring him great glory - or terrible destruction.",
