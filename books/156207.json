  "title": "Endeavor: One Polish Family's Journey from Siberia to Freedom",
  "description": "Beginning on February 10, 1940, almost two million citizens of Eastern Poland were forcibly removed from their homes by Joseph Stalin's NKVD and deported to Siberian gulags, where they suffered unspeakable hardship, deprivation, and extermination through work. Accused of being \"anti-Soviet elements,\" these victims of an ethnic cleansing campaign endured a brutal existence in subarctic temperatures before they were given \"amnesty\" on July 30, 1941. Learn about survival, sacrifice, and the resilience of the human spirit in this gripping historical narrative. Join eleven-year-old Thecla Raczynski and her family as they leave their labor camp and travel almost twenty thousand miles on their journey to freedom.",
