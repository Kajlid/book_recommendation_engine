They’ve been best friends since they were children, and he desperately wants to be a part of Alanna’s life. Unfortunately, Alanna catches the attention of a century-old werewolf by the name of Roger Mason. Roger becomes hell bent on having Alanna as his own, and when she refuses to be his mate, she and Quinten are both abducted and shipped off to compete in the Arena Wars.The Arena Wars is a brutal fight to the death with your bare hands that takes place in a reconstructed gladiator-style arena. The fights are headed by Elias, a nine hundred year old vampire. Partners fight to the death with no weapons and no rules. If you refuse to fight, you’re killed on the spot. If you lose a fight, you die. Elias takes a special interest in Alanna, especially in her blood. This leads Alanna to believe that she’s meant to be his soul mate. Can Quinten convince her otherwise?",
