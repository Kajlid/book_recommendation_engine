  "title": "The Ruler of the Toys",
  "description": "While this is second in a series it is a stand alone book and it is not necessary to have read the first one. 1983 spin says the days of racial hatred are over. Yet prejudice leads to murder in a mystery which reaches back a century, finding the age old motives devaluing lives of some, while enhancing others are the same as ever. Innocents are the victims when sin becomes legal in this serious Whodunnit. Plate and Daphne must make life and death choices in a world where good and evil have blurred and a wrong decision is fatal. Second in a series with the descendant of a 1900s law man and his insurance agent girlfriend.",
