  "title": "Gracie Mae, A Story of Courage and Love",
  "description": "Gracie Mae escapes the madness of an abusive husband when she and her children, Ella 4 years of age, and Jacob, only 18 months old, move back to Gracie's home town of Sanford, Illinois where they take shelter with her sister and fianc√©, Greta and Frank. The attraction to Dr. John Azzari was immediate when a visit to the pediatrician office became necessary due to Jacob's ear infections. As a receptive pediatrician, John sensed this family was running from something, or someone. When Gracie Mae confides in the gracious doctor, the magnetism between them is amplified to a new level. Whenever Gracie finally felt she could live a life of happiness with her small children, her feelings of hopeful contentment were crushed by threats from her husband, Rich, which eventually became a horrific reality.",
