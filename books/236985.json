  "description": "Illustrated with over 1,000 images, Guess Who Is the Happiest Girl in Town is the first memoir by Swiss-German party girl Susi Wyss (b. 1938). The 40-year history begins in the 1970s with Wyss studying fashion design in Zurich, where at 18 years old she was initiated into the fast-moving life of the European jet set, a world revolving around the elite names in the international music and fashion scene. A regular model for Helmut Newton, the young Wyss enjoyed the company of noted celebrities ranging from Dennis Hopper and Iggy Pop to J. Paul Getty. After years of partying with rock-n-roll royalty she became one of Paris s top madams and finally, in her early 60s, a writer. This intimate autobiography / photographic diary is a fascinating record capturing a time when the world of drugs, sex, and rock and roll was at its zenith.",
