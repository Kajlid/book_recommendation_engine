  "description": "Ron Hull was paralyzed during spinal surgery in 1963. Able to walk with atrophied hands and arms, a hand splint enabled Ron to write and return to college with help from a rehab program. Ron's life changed dramatically but he was determined and, with good grades, got a fellowship to Stanford and a job in industry. A doctorate and 45-year career in higher education while the paralysis and discrimination continued to increase is his story.",
