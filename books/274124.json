Between turning everything into either a personal scratching post or litter box, and the constant cat and mouse game of “love me/leave me alone,” Cath and Dad have a lot to learn! Cath also learns how good it is to have a constant companion, a role Cath’s dad is trying to fill on his own. It’s a hilarious and heartwarming adventure of daily life of this little girl…with a dad and a cat along for the ride!",
