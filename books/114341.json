  "description": "When Nick McCoy first met Piper, he was lost and nursing a broken heart; so when she offers him a no-strings attached relationship, he is eager to accept. What he first thinks of as good arrangement, turns into something so much bigger. Something that could change his life forever.  For Piper love doesn't exist. She spends her time running her business and only entering into casual relationships. She never stays with one man long, and so far that has worked for her. When Nick comes along, he shows her something different; he shows her that things can't always be simple. And maybe, just maybe, love does exist after all.",
