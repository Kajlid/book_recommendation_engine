  "description": "(A Suncoast Society series book.)[Siren Sensations Erotic Alternative Consensual BDSM Romance, M/M, bondage, caning, spanking, HEA] Ben didn't know his Master and boyfriend would leave him homeless and in the lurch. Throw in identity theft just to add insult to injury, too. When his best friend and co-worker, Jake, invites him to move into his spare bedroom, it's the answer to a prayer. Ben knows Jake's straight, but it doesn't stop him from fantasizing about the handsome Dom. The last thing Jake wants is to take advantage of Ben and come off looking like a douche. That's why, for now, he keeps his carefully guarded secret--that he's bi, not straight. Toss in a pair of homophobic parents and keeping that fact quiet has made his life easier. But as he realizes Ben is perfect for him, Jake's forced to confront the realities of life. The choice to be with Ben means facing down his parents and confronting darker, more dangerous realities that he never encountered before as a \"straight\" man. But can he admit his feelings before someone else steals Ben's heart? ** A Siren Erotic RomanceThe other books in the Suncoast Series are standalone works, but are best read in the following order to reduce  \n   Safe Harbor \n   Cardinal's Rule \n   Domme by Default \n   The Reluctant Dom \n   The Denim Dom \n   Pinch Me \n   Broken Toy \n   A Clean Sweep \n   A Roll of the Dice \n   His Canvas \n   A Lovely Shade of Ouch \n   Crafty Bastards \n   A Merry Little Kinkmas \n   Sapiosexual \n   A Very Kinky Valentine's Day \n   Things Made Right \n   Click \n   Spank or Treat  \n   A Turn of the Screwed \n   Chains \n   Kinko de Mayo \n   Broken Arrow \n   Out of the Spotlight \n   Friends Like These  \n   Vicious Carousel  \n   Hot Sauce \n   Open Doors \n   One Ring  \n   Vulnerable \n   The Strength of the Pack \n   Initiative \n   Impact \n   Liability \n   Switchy \n   Rhymes With Orange \n   Beware Falling Ice \n   Beware Falling Rocks \n   Dangerous Curves Ahead \n   Two Against Nature \n   Home at Last \n   A Kinkmas Carol \n   Ask DNA \n   Time Out of Mind \n   Happy Valenkink's Day (Coming 2/6/2017) \n   Splendid Isolation (Coming 2/20/2017) \n   Similar to Rain (Coming 3/6/2017)",
