  "title": "Cranial Guitar: Selected Poems",
  "description": "Poetry. African American Studies. CRANIAL GUITAR collects poems that first appeared in The Ancient Rain and Crowded with Loneliness, and includes the entire text of the long-out-of-print Golden Sardine, in the only major collection available of the late poet Bob Kaufman. Kaufman was active (except during a decade long self-imposed silence) in the poetry scenes of San Francisco and New York from the 1950s to the 1980s, and has attained cult status for his place at the forefront of the Beat movement. \"Kaufman is also known as one of America's true surrealist poets, a premier jazz poet, and a major poet of the black consciousness movement. So much did he embody a French tradition of the poet as outsider, madman, and outcast, that in France, Kaufman was called the Black Rimbaud.\"--from the introduction by David Henderson.",
