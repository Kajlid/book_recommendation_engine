  "description": "I just started to grasp that my best friend is a half-blood vampire, and now I'm facing demons of my own. Colby needs my help with an ancient prophesy, and a mysterious loner, Hunter, has been kind enough to take me under his wing. But is he teaching me or studying me? Usually I'm on the sidelines but have been thrust into the thick of things by a zombie vampire attack and a surprising declaration revealing that I'm a Demon Hunter. Too bad no one buys it. If I could only get my best friend to believe in me before an ancient evil destroys her and her half-blood sisters, I might actually get the guy and save the world.",
