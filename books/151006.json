  "description": "Dear Author,I’m the one with the tattoos and white hair. I’ve been part of the King’s army for the past 10 years and for the last few I’ve been commanding a unit at the border beside my frigid friend here. I want to kiss the frost off of him but I’m not sure I’d survive once his shock wore off.Can you help me please author? I’m dying over here!Photo Description: Two soldiers stand side by side in the mist. One, with dark hair and very pale skin, looks stern. He is dressed in black. The other, in a leather vest, is leaning on a post, looking more relaxed. He has white hair and darker skin. Despite their differences, the two are clearly friends.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love’s Landscapes\" event.
