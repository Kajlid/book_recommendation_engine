  "description": "After a run-in with a rude synthpet client that leaves her in tears, the last thing Sam needs is to get called down to her ailing father’s office…yet again. The day gets worse when it’s her vicious step-brother from hell who greets her, only to make her an offer no good daughter could refuse.  Arles has wanted—needed—his sweet step-sister in his life for far too long, and now he’s finally found a way to get her. Of course it means making her hate him first, but what else is new?  Look Back in Anger Series Synopsis  Sam can't remember much of being a child, but the scraps of memory she clings to all hold the same terror--Arles Colfter. Now he's blackmailing her, threatening her elderly father, and forcing her to face a past long buried. Plus she's pretty sure he's a baby-eating werewolf.  In this urban fantasy novel, all SynthPet technician Samantha wants is to live quietly with her herd of cats and one-eared dog, but when Arles kidnaps her, she’s forced to unravel a thorny tangle of truth and lies, or risk being dragged down the rabbit hole into Arles's world of intrigue, gun-toting vigilantes, and...zombies.  WARNING: Look Back in Anger is a serial. This is episode one of six. Individual episodes may not have a completed story arc, as they are building blocks to a larger work, much in the way a season of television can be broken into smaller parts. Individual episodes may not all include the same elements, such as sex, violence, and mature language, but it should be understood that these are elements of the series as a whole and any individual episode may in fact include these elements.",
