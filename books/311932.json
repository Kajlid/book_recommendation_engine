  "description": "All Jacob Goldman wanted was for his boyfriend to not take him for granted. His plans, however, only gained him an ex-boyfriend, a damaged classic car, a charge of bird murder, angry townsfolk, and a hot mechanic he wants nothing to do with. All he wants now is his car fixed and to not be run out of town by the angry townsfolk of Oleander for involuntary birdslaughter. Falling for his annoying mechanic is no part of Jacob’s plan.Levi Greene is tired of being alone. He’s also tired of pining for his best friend, a man who’s in love with someone else. Jacob Goldman, an uber-twink from South Florida, isn’t even close to being Levi’s type. Nevertheless, he’s uncontrollably drawn to Jacob, and it isn’t just the lure of fixing his damaged classic car. Jacob touches Levi in a way that makes him want more, even if Levi knows that more isn’t in the cards for either one of them.Rebound is the story of two men giving up on hopeless relationships only to fall into each other’s arms, more or less, and find that they complete each other in a way no other man could. There is hate sex, a bird funeral, “special” baked goods, a redneck seder, and an accidental overabundance of flamingos. Jacob and Levi fight each other but find they can’t fight the bond that forms between them or the love that will, despite all obstacles, have its own way. This novel is a sequel to Reunion, but features a new couple and can be read on its own.",
