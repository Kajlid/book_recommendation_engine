  "description": "\"Patterns of life are selfish and unforgiving.\" explains Nariman Hansotia,the resident storyteller of Firozsha Baag.And in these eleven intersecting stories, Rohinton Mistry opens our eyes and our hearts to the rich, complex patterns of life inside this Bombay apartment building. The occupants - from Jaakaylee, the ghost-seer, through Najamai, the only owner of a refrigerator in Firozsha Baag, to Rustomji the Curmudgeon and Kersi, the young boy whose life threads through the book - all express the tensions between the past and the present, between the old world and the new. Compassionate and funny in turns, Tales from Firozsha Baag illuminates the very meaning of change through this pungent and exuberantly textured mosaic of lives.",
