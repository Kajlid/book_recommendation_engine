Humans were not the only ones that survived the zombie apocalypse. Vampires, once at the top of the food chain, now face extinction. They are caught between a dwindling food supply and the undead who hunt them. In this savage new world, Mordecai now searches not just for food but also meaning. Will he find either one, or simply fade out of existence?",
