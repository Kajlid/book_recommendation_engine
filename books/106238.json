  "description": "The popular conception or more correctly misconception is that New York City alone is The Big Apple. The truth is much larger, historically more complicated and deeply meaningful. The apple is an icon. It is the fruit of the gods,Eve, the Beatles,the Apple computer company, and it will forever reside in Paradise.Apples are beautiful,aromatic,iconic,the food of love,food of survival,romance,intelligence ,health , wisdom, opportunity, and creativity, and the most popular fruit in the world.Their hallmark is their innate spontaineous creativity, which makes them stand out from all other tree-grown fruits, as witnessed by their over 10,00 varieties. That quality is in harmony with the spirit of New York. My book alone shows how the apple became a New Yorker and how New York became The Big Apple.This adventure and mystery story is at the heart of New York. I follow the apple from the gods of Paradise to the arrival of the Europeans with their apple seeds to settle and grow in New York.The story involves the Revolutionary war, Civil war , carrying us to the Jazz age,and how Russia came into the story. How New York State became the largest producer of apples in the world and onto the present day when it's the largest producer of apple varieties in the world. The book has 26 original botanical illustrations of available heritage apples.Listing of 190 New York heritage apple orchards with their location and contact information. Topping this all off is the last chapter \"Lets Eat\" which includes 23 recipes, historic and modern. Several are from the Culinary Institute of America.",
