  "description": "What do you do when your husband dumps you for his PA, your company goes broke and your nearly published novel is cancelled?Gina, a barely 50-something corporate high-flier, is counting her losses when a chance meeting throws a sea change her way. A job as a house/dog-sitter – albeit in a minus one-star leaky cottage in windswept Shelly Beach – seems the perfect opportunity to relax and regroup. But Gina hasn't counted on the locals, and soon finds herself reluctantly convening the writers' group, babysitting, baking, seal-watching, bicycling . . . and perhaps even falling in love.With a cast of unforgettable characters, The Shelly Beach Writers' Group is an irresistible story of reinvention.",
