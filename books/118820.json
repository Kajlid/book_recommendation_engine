  "description": "In Red Tape and White Knuckles, celebrated adventurer and author Lois Pryce shares the story of her 10,000 mile journey through the vast continent of Africa. Setting off from her home in London, Lois makes her way to the shores of Tunisia, the Sahara Desert, war-torn Angola, and the Congo basin before reaching her ultimate destination of Cape Town, South Africa. While some riders might insist on a high powered adventure motorcycle, fancy gear, and even a support crew for an expedition such as this, Lois makes her journey on a simple 250cc motorbike, wearing climate-appropriate travel clothes, and carrying along only the bare necessities.  Through her forthright writing, down to earth nature, and cheeky sense of humor, Lois makes this incredible, sometimes scary, and always surprising motorcycle journey through Africa accessible to everyone. Despite challenges and unexpected surprises throughout her journey, Lois tackles every obstacle head on and with immense strength of character. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned adventure motorcyclist, or just your average person looking for a good read, this story of action, discovery and achievement is sure to inspire and entertain from start to finish.",
