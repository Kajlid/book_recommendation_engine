  "description": "Share the new girl. That won’t be easy, will it? Especially not while trying to keep our thrones in the Burberry Prep social scene. Marnye is learning to forgive us; the least we can do is protect her. Let’s see who can make her fall in love first. This time, there’s no bet. This time, it’s just our hearts on the line.  ***  Take on the filthy rich girls—and do it with the help of the boys. It’s us versus them, and it’s not going to be pretty. The king of the school, a pissed-off narcoleptic, a tattooed rockstar, a varsity football player, and a prince. Five guys to back me up, five boys that give me butterflies. They say they’ve changed their ways; it’s time to see if they can keep that promise.",
