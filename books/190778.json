  "description": "Listening Length: 4 hours and 41 minutes. Warning: This is not a traditional love story. This book is fiction and contains material readers may find offensive. She was his. Irrevocably. Undeniably. Ruby Jacobson was going to have a new life, but it seemed fate gave her a twisted version of it. She is taken from her bed and given to a man that calls her his. Gavin Darris has always desired the darker pleasures in life. He sees Ruby, and he wants her like he has never wanted anything else before. She has a determination in her eyes, and is exactly what he is looking for. The desires Ruby has felt inside of her are about to be tempted. She should hate Gavin, and fear everything he represents, but she also can't deny that her body aches for his touch. Ruby is faced with the ultimate decision: leave and be alone in the world, or stay with Gavin whose desires for her are just as wickedly dark as her own. Both are frightening.",
