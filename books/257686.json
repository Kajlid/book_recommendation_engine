  "description": "Sacrificing yourself for those you love is sometimes the only decision you can make.  After slipping away from Dr. Patton and his cult of crazies, the boys and I escaped to their hometown in Connecticut to hide out with the family that practically raised them. Things seemed to settle down for a while, but it was all an illusion.  Dr. Patton was determined to see his genocidal dreams become a reality. He needed me to gain access to and influence certain executives in the highest level of the government, and heâ€™d get my cooperation by any means necessary. Using the people I loved as leverage, he gave me no choice.  I had to sacrifice my beliefs, my values, and my freedom in order to save them. No cost was too great. Even if it meant using my power against those most important to me.   Recommended for ages 16+ for mature content.",
