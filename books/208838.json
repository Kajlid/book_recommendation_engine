  "description": "Jamie has been an NHL superstar since he was barely out of highschool. He’s had a long time to develop his reputation as a brilliant, but short-tempered goalie. He’s made more than a few enemies over the years. He doesn’t care. This year, he’s got his heart set on the Cup, and things are looking good.  But there’s no one who he hates quite as much as Oliver Bouchard, an infuriating winger with a big mouth who’s totally got Jamie’s number. When Oliver is traded to Jamie’s team in a shocking mid-season move, Jamie realizes something even worse: not only is Oliver a grade-A trash talker, he’s also smoking hot.  Will Jamie be able to grit his teeth and make nice? Or will his temper get the best of him once and for all, and bring his whole team down with him?  **This 68,000 word MM sports romance novel has a few steamy scenes, a HEA, no cliffhangers and is a standalone. Shot on Goal is also Book 2 in the Highlight Reel Hockey Romance Series.**",
