  "title": "No Sleep 'til Sudbury",
  "description": "A refreshingly no-holds-barred narrative look at what it was like growing up in the 80s as a hard rock and heavy metal fan in a small northern Ontario town. The rock history is here and some academic treatise is included as well, but these aspects are uniquely woven together with personal experiences and biting commentary to make No Sleep â€˜til Sudbury a highly entertaining observation of the power of musical nostalgia as a pop cultural force.",
