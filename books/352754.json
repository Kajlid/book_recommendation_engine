  "title": "The Southern Lady: From Pedestal to Politics 1830-1930",
  "description": "The first part of Anne Scott's unique study reveals the wide gap between the image of the Lady in the antebellum South and the harsh reality of a life which demanded tremendous strength and responsibility on the part of women. Using contemporary diaries and letters, the author shows how southern women of the planter class felt about their lives, and how many of them longed for emancipation from the limitations of the plantation system, even to the point of supporting the abolition of slavery.The second part of the book describes the post-Civil War conditions which created new professional and political opportunities for women, and shows how they used unlikely organizations - missionary societies, clubs, and the WTCU - to advance their own development. Maintaining the outward appearance of perfect ladies, these women arrived on the political scene wearing hats and white gloves, minding their manners, and, as often as not, relying upon respectable ancestry to camouflage their radicalism.This book is the first study of its kind. A survey based on a careful combing of manuscript sources as well as contemporary printed materials, it points the way to more detailed studies of the actual process by which women's emancipation has progressed.",
