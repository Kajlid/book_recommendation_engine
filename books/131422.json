Lily groaned at the sensation and looked back at Devon with need clearly in her eyes “Down there.” she whispered.Devon smiled playfully at her. “Lily, do you want me to touch your pussy?”Lily was dealing with waves of sensation as the dancer had moved from sucking her finger to sucking her nipple so she could only nod yes.Devon wasn’t satisfied with that so she asked, “Lily, do you want me to touch your pussy…or kiss it?”Lily sucked in a sharp breath at the image that brought to mind.
