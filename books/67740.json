  "description": "My name’s Annie Graceland.Three things to know about me: I’m a Midwesterner living in L.A. I run my own baking business. I talk to dead people and I figure out who murdered them.When Mom signs me up to be a judge at Wisconsin's Hometown Guy Contest, I picture traveling home for the 4th of July weekend to Oconomowoc for some fun in the sun and catching up with old friends. I don’t picture some idiot murdering Oconomowoc’s ‘Hometown Guy.’ Don’t picture Frank Plank haunting me to catch his killer. Definitely don’t picture being up to my twitchy eyeballs investigating pageant suspects, fending off former high school boyfriends, or discovering the local detective's been crushing on me for years.How dicey can this trip home get?",
