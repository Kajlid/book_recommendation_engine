  "title": "Twisted Tales: Six Fairy Tales Turned Inside Out",
  "description": "The so-called villains and innocent bystanders of six famous fairy tales share their points of view in this hilarious collection of tales. Perhaps the big bad wolf was in fact very kind and friendly, but just a little hungry; and maybe the princess couldn’t feel the pea at all, but just couldn’t get to sleep. Quirky, funny, and full of rhyming, alliteration, and word play, these are rollicking rewrites of old classics.",
