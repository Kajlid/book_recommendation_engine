But for Jo, Rose Cottage was a painful reminder of her youthful summer romance with Pete Catlett, whose infidelity had come to light when Jo learned of his shotgun wedding....Pete couldn't believe it when Jo reappeared at Rose Cottage, but he got the distinct impression that he was the last person Jo wanted to see on her doorstep. Pete vowed to gain Jo's forgiveness for his betrayal...and perhaps win her heart in the process?",
