She had given her Uncle Gianni a run for his money in more ways than she could count. Uncle G had warned her that one more stunt and he would be done with her. Being an unwed mother to an outlaw bikerâ€™s baby would definitely qualify. Riker Devlin was Saints to the bone. He rode hard, lived free, and answered only to himself and his president. The last thing he ever expected was to be presented with a choice that would turn the carefree life he knew spinning on its wheels. Set against a backdrop of intrigue, violence, and chivalry this sixth installment of the Hells Saints MC series takes you on a wild ride with your favorite band of brothers.",
