  "description": "Bestselling author Emma Nichols presents a new adult contemporary romance fans and critics are comparing to works of Jennifer Weiner. Snark and heart make The Souvenir a novel that will leave readers desperate for more.\n  Wren Jacobs—a twenty-something corporate trainer— would like to announce the birth of her baby, Taylor, named after the artist singing \"Bad Blood\" during the conception. Mother and child are adjusting nicely and ready to welcome visitors, especially the father, Brady Conner.  Despite a few too many misunderstandings, Wren never stopped loving Brady…and would love the opportunity to thank him for her souvenir from their relationship who weighed in at a whopping 8lbs 5oz, effectively ruining her after an unintentional natural delivery. Taylor's birth will forever remind Wren of the first day of summer, the last time she was ever able to wear a bikini, and that she'll probably never go to a bar again.  \nFollow Wren and Brady as they navigate through the tricky dating scene in this touching romantic comedy, and fall in love with the souvenir of their relationship.",
