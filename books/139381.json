  "title": "The Shenandoah",
  "description": "The Shenandoah River is one of the most loved rivers of the United States. Flowing northward between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Alleghenies, through Virginia and West Virginia, the Shenandoah joins the Potomac at Harpers Ferry. This was the entrance to the valley when Indians used it as a hunting ground and here the Germans from Pennsylvania and the Scotch Covenanters entered it before the English from the Tidewater came over the mountains to stay. John Brown staged his famous raid at the mouth of the river and the valley was the scene of the campagn of its hero, Stonewall Jackson. Famous names on both sides of the Civil War are inextricably woven in the Shenandoah's history. This intricate story of a section which was devasted and rose again is written with skill and sensitivity by Julia Davis.",
