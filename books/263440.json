  "description": "A completely new and light-hearted look at the current state of today’s Police Service. Real, interesting stories are shared from a detective’s perspective and first-hand experiences. Inspired by PC David Copperfield’s bestselling Wasting Police Time. Welcome to the Farce is written by a real police officer serving in a real police force. Although names and places have been changed, this is in many ways a true account. The book takes an up to date and humorous look at the state of today’s Police Service. Despite ongoing budget cuts affecting the world of policing, the author’s own constabulary and others waste money and resources they have on anything apart from the pursuit of law and order. Detective Miggins has written this book from an entirely new and fresh perspective – a detectives perspective. Although light-hearted, it covers more serious topics referring to the distractions, waste and barriers which hinder most officers from providing the service they signed up to when they swore the oath of constable. Why do criminals escape meaningful justice? Why don’t you see Police officers on the streets? And just where have the rest disappeared to? Providing fascinating stories and anecdotes from Miggins’ experience in the force, the book answers important questions.",
