  "description": "He was dying...the doctors told him had had only a few months to live and there was nothing they could do. But death wasn't what scared T.J. Littejohn; he had a wife and three children, and nothing to leave them but a tiny slice of East Texas prairie and a handful of cows. He needed the money and he needed it fast. A wanted poster in the sheriff's office gave him the answer--he became a bounty hunter. Read by Gene Engene 6 CD's 6.6 Hrs.",
