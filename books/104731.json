  "description": "Elizabeth spent her entire adult life avoiding a serious relationship. As the leading written authority on relationships she couldn't afford a failed relationship so she kept her liaisons casual and short term.When she hired Joshua to build her mountain home deep in the Utah mountains she found herself attracted to the muscular, rugged construction magnet. Used to dating CEO's and even Heads of State, Josh was unlike anyone she'd met before.This laid back, sexy man challenged everything she believed in especially the three-year rule she had sold to the world that insisted everyone has a fake or pseudo personality they displayed to their new lover that hid their inner self and sheltered their secrets. Her belief that you must date someone for at least three years before their true personality was revealed was being shattered by a down to earth modern day mountain man.",
