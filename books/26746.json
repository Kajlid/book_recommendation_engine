  "title": "Kleptomania: Ten Stories",
  "description": "In this brilliantly versatile collection of stories from the award-winning author of Harvest, the reader will encounter a range of themes, from murder mystery to science fiction. The author's vision of a post-apocalypse future is dark, but rendered with a rich vein of irony and humour that allows us to roller-coast with her into a world where air and water and the earth itself take on new shades of meaning. Then there are the here-and-now stories of bodies turning up in backyards, of love betrayed and sexuality discovered, of bitter awakenings and upbeat endings. Intelligent, opinionated, and playful, this is a collection that defies limitations of time, space, and imagination to conjure up new morality tales for our time.",
