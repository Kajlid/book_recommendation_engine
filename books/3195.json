She visits the bookshop, the discount store, and the supermarket, and she's home by nine o'clock. It's utterly innocuous, but Bea Wentworth is a state senator, one of the most powerful women in Connecticut, and for that she must be punished. The kidnapper has been tracking her routine for weeks, and soon he'll make his move.When Bea is abducted, she awakens in a damp, underground dungeon, tied to a table and left to die. It falls to her husband, gentle children's book author Lyon Wentworth, to save her from a horrible fate. With the help of the local chief of police, Rocco Herbert, Lyon must rescue the woman he loves--and determine which of her many enemies is sick enough to perpetrate this horrible crime.Few authors understand how to balance suspense and emotional realism as well as Richard Forrest does. His Lyon and Bea Wentworth Mysteries are classic, page-turning thrillers, anchored by the genuine emotional bond between the two main characters. In all of mystery fiction, there's absolutely nothing like them.Death Under the Lilacs is the 6th book in the Lyon and Bea Wentworth Mysteries, but you may enjoy reading the series in any order.",
