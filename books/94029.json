Nor did he ever picture himself a married man in a polyamorous relationship.Happy and content, Nicolas, Ellie, and Luca embark on a quest to learn all they can about the greatest mind of the Renaissance. But their world takes a devastating and deadly turn that sends Nicolas into the seedy deviant underworld of Victorian London. It soon becomes clear that Conte Acario Bruno lives, and the madman wants far more than Leonardoâ€™s book. He wants Nicolas dead and Luca for himself.",
