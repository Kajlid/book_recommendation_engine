  "description": "You can't have Hope if you aren't Loving and you can't be Loving if you don't have Hope. Hope alone can convey several feelings, covering the spectrum of happiness and joy through depression if you lack it. “I Hope today will be a good day” or “I Hope my family and friends are alright” if you are worried about them. Of course, on the far side of the spectrum, you could “Hope something happens to someone” or even “Hope you win the lottery”. It's subtle differences at times in the feelings and meaning conveyed when expressing Hope. If you are a Loving person by nature, Hope will usually be expressed as an uplifting feeling that brings joy to everyone around you.",
