He has just moved into an apartment with his three queer best friends and for the first time they can do whatever they want. What they want to do, is get drunk and go clubbing.When the friends pre-game then stumble into a bar they've never seen before, they have no way of knowing that they somehow bluffed their way into a super elite, super supernatural millionaires club.Danny spends the whole night socializing with Cassin, a guy who seems vaguely familiar to him but insists they've never met. Danny goes home with him that night, and when he wakes up in the morning, he realizes that Cassin owns the company that his dad works for--that's where he's seen him.Cassin seems un-bothered with Danny's... unconventional body... and indeed seems to be obsessed with him in general. The pair get closer and closer until secrets come out that neither of them can ignore...",
