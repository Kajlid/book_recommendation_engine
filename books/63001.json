  "description": "Travelling through our diverse and fascinating world can be invigorating, uplifting and life changing. Of course, it can also be baffling, disgusting, aggravating and ridiculous. In this hilarious tribute to world travel Johnston takes you on an absurd rollercoaster ride through 43 countries, 11 grueling treks, 10 overnight boat trips and 1 confusing encounter with a body pillow shaped like a giant lake trout. His shocking advice, humorous travel stories and strange obsession with the sex lives of celebrities will have you laughing out loud, inspire you to travel and slowly but surely convince you to stock up on hand sanitizer.“It opens with book recommendations that I read out loud to my husband because I was laughing so hard. If you want to travel, have traveled, enjoy reading about travel then this book is for you……bottom line: it’s a fantastic read”Helene in Between",
