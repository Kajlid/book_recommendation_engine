Full of all the unpleasantness children and adults have come to love, The Cumbersome Collection includes the first 11 books of the wildly popular A Series of Unfortunate Events. As always, be forewarned that there is nothing to be found in this series but \"misery, despair, and discomfort.\" Read at your own risk.",
