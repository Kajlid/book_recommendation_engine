  "description": "Naomi Demas is seventeen, and her relationship with her mother is conflicted. Irene is obsessive and strange. She has never gotten over Naomi's disability, or her twin's infant death. When Naomi was eight, Irene left with Naomi's older sister. Naomi is sustained by her faith, her connection with her deceased twin, and her commitment to her remaining family. She also finds purpose in her connection with her valued friends -- whose struggles include alcoholism, foster care, and learning disabilities. There is excitement in Naomi's romance with her boyfriend Matt, focus in her love of school, and comfort through her trusted horse. But she is unsettled...Naomi's surviving sister, Jo, has reached out to her as their mother deteriorates in new ways, and as it is becoming clear that Matt is not who Naomi thought he was. She must find yet more strength when an emergency throws her half-brother into serious danger and tests everyone's loyalties.Burning the Boats tells the story of a young woman, the ones she loves, and the value of her disability. It is a story about commitment, integrity, choices, consequences and convictions. Here is a world of loss, betrayal, love, trust, and healing when least expected.",
