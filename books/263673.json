  "description": "June 1944. Joan Foster had no way of knowing when or if fate would reunite her with the maddeningly good-looking Sgt. Dick Thimble, the tall, soft spoken soldier from Washington, D.C. They’d scarcely become engaged after knowing each other only weeks, when he had been called away.The war takes a giant step closer when all of their men are suddenly deployed. Only Bernice’s wild surprise is enough to take Annie’s mind off Sylvester’s MIA status. It’s not until Helen comes up with a plan that Joan, Annie, Bernice, and she find the way to reunite them all in the Victory Garden.",
