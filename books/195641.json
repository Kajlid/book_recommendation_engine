Saint Patrick's Day includes ... \"Erin Go Boom\" -- featuring Father Frank Williams, terrorists are about to blow up the New York City parade, and only one man can stop them! A Catholic priest ... We're doomed!  \"Boys of the Old Brigade\" -- A Sean AP Ryan story by twitter, when the psychotic mercenary goes up again an \"IRA group\" by any means necessary, and beats them 140 characters at a time.  The Forth of July \"See Something\" -- When terrorists conspire to wreak havoc in the new World Trade Center, it's up to two civilians to stop them.  Christmas stories! \"Oh Little Town of Bethmayhem\" -- the month before Christmas, terrorists plan to blow up the town of Bethlehem, and nobody can stop them. Nobody! Thankfully, there's a nobody on call.  \"Deck the Maul\" -- Sean A.P. Ryan is back, and he's working mall security on Black Friday. Will the mall survive him?  And more!",
