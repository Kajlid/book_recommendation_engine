  "description": "From the creators of Little Pea and Little Hoot comes this tidy tale of a decidedly different pig. Little Oink is a neat little fellow. Clean clean clean that's all he wants to do. But Mama and Papa won't have it! They say in order to be a proper pig he has to learn to make a proper mess. \"Don't come out until your room is a pigsty \" says Papa Pig. \"I won't have any child of mine going out looking so neat and clean. It's just not acceptable \" says Mama Pig. Readers who hate to clean up will love this humorous twist on a universal dilemma.",
