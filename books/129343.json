  "description": "A JOURNEY TO HELL to redeem long-lost love...and pride. A quest of outmost peril with no guaranteed return. How far would you go to regain true-love? It's darker than a man trying to redeem his loved one: he forsook her for ultimate power! A mighty Necromancer must trespass into hell and face the Devil himself. Frozen emotions thaw as purpose springs to life. It was not his ambitious conquest of the world that impassioned him, but the dead-end of a now broken delusion. After eons of eternal life, King Deathenor yearns to undo the bargain he struck with the Devil in exchange for ultimate power. He craves to redeem his shattered soul. Summoned by the awakening of a dusty theory, he contemplates trespassing into hell to relinquish the contract he signed with blood. Everything is at stake. Failure is not an option. If he prevails, death after corresponded love shall be his greatest triumph.Burrow for free or purchase a copy for $0.99:Amazon: http://bit.ly/EternalRedemption",
