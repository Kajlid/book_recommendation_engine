  "description": "\"Antonia shivered. It was getting cold and dark, perhaps this wasn't the best idea. After all, she was still starving. Suddenly, she made a decision. Turning around, she put her hand onto the gondolero's bare arm and dropped her shields.\"\"Agatha now waited patiently – whiling away her time – but sensing her deepening hunger. ‘Young blood’, she mouthed silently to herself as she felt the twinges of her anxious fangs.\"Antonia and Agatha have been around for over 300 years and each have their own unique ways of dealing with their immortality. From the romantic canal-ways of the Venice of the 18th century, to the modern, industrialised wasteland of a small forgotten town. Read Twice Bitten, which includes 'Escape In Venice' and 'My Take Away Vampire' to discover that you can’t always believe everything you thought you knew about vampires.",
