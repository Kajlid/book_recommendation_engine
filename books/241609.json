  "description": "Jane Rule’s incandescent third novel explores love, loss, and family . . . and the pieces of ourselves we leave behindBorn lame, Amelia Larson lives in the house that has been in her family for generations. Now she has a decision to make: Should she honor the dying wish of her sister, Beatrice, to burn her diaries? There are sixty-nine in all: one journal for each year of Beatrice’s life since the age of six.Beginning in 1913 and traversing World War I and beyond, the diaries become a moving counterpoint to Amelia’s life as they unpeel layers of family history. As the past starts to impinge on the present, her relations—then and now—come to vivid life.Told from alternating points of view, Against the Season opens an illuminating window into small-town life. As the sins and secrets of a family are revealed through the sometimes-faulty lens of memory, it is a story about the seasons of life and the ties that bind us even beyond death.",
