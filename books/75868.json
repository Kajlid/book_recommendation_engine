Now, Tancred and I must fight for the gods of Albion against the Titans. Peace - a firefly's brief flash of life.\" Camelot's Champion is now the King of Albion and his fate unfolds rapidly. He is bound on a quest. Taranis has charged him to find items containing the power necessary to defeat the Titans before they wake and destroy Albion. However, it's never quite that simple. He must travel the length and breadth of his new land with Nimue, the wife of his dead father and the woman who tried to kill Arthur. Fortunately, he also has Rhea, his adopted daughter who happens to be a Titan and of course Tancred. The young man must face his greatest challenge with Lancelot at his side, but will it be enough? Can Lancelot hold Tancred together? Both men are drawn forward while they seek the power the gods need to fight the Titans. All rests once more on their broad shoulders, how long can they continue to carry the burden and fight the wars? Lancelot's Burden is the fifth in the Knights Of Camelot Series and charges onward with all the passion and intrigue we've come to love in this revolutionary and controversial cycle.",
