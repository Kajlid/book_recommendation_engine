  "title": "What to Say to Someone Who's Dying",
  "description": "A young boy searches for answers. An elderly German woman tends her bees. A family adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides. A girl and her mother pass meaningful moments together. In this slender volume, Chanel Earl explores the many faces of grief, the grief of children, parents, those set to die, and those left behind. This debut collection of tightly written prose weaves together themes of loss and family as well as the hope peculiar to youth. These stories of acceptance and resolve ask questions about love and the beauty of life.",
