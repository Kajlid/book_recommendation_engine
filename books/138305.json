  "description": "Man of the Month -- MR. SEPTEMBER Specimen: Male; age 32; intense blue eyes hidden by thick glasses; gosh-awful beard; perpetual scowl; rear end worthy of the hall of fame. Native Habitat: Laboratory; alone, bent over a microscope. Mating Habits: Unexplored. Love: an unknown quantity — no scientific evidence it exists. Clement Cornelius Barto used scientific accomplishments and accolades to keep him insulated from the world. Women scared him speechless — literally — and he found it far safer to stay wrapped in his laboratory cocoon. Until Martha Eberly appeared at his cabin. She was the most beautiful creature he had ever beheld in his entire uneventful life. Clem was about to discover a thing called love. And with a little beginner's luck it might be the breakthrough he'd been searching for!",
