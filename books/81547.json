  "description": "When the world is at war, even an island is not safe. Abigail Maduro arrives in the Danish West Indies in 1916 to live with her Aunt Esther, a bad tempered spinster, and her houseful of eccentric servants. Despite the island's veneer of tranquility, St. Thomas is a hotbed of German spies and saboteurs who use their Hamburg-America Line steamers to aid the Kaiser's war effort. When a mysterious stranger suddenly appears in town, Abigail is drawn into the conflict. In the handsome, scholarly Erich Seibold, she finds the friendship and love she has been craving, even when she learns that Erich is really a deserter from a German U-boat. Their idyllic interlude comes to a crashing halt when the island's German consul also discovers Erich's identity and blackmails him into committing sabotage, forcing Abigail to risk her life to save him. Action and adventure abound in this colorful historical novel that brings to life a fading West Indian sugar colony in the last days of Danish rule.",
