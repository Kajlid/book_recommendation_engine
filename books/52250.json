  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Paula has just left behind convent boarding school - to go home. She hasn't been back home for more than two years, and isn't quite prepared for her five rambunctious brothers, two eccentric maiden aunts, bibliophile uncle, and 89 year-old Babbett, not to mention the demands laid on her by energetic Mama. Her father, Judge Eisenberth, at first seems to be the only one who understands her frustration. Even Adolf, her favorite brother, cannot fathom why she longs to go back to the convent and become a nun. Paula - and Adolf, who is going through his own trials - must face their problems and learn how to deal with everyday dilemmas as a part of the growing-up process. Set in 19th century Germany, this book is not only excellent as a \"coming-of-age\" story, but sheds a fascinating light on the everyday life and customs of the Rhineland.",
