  "description": "ON A TRAIL OF DANGER, THEIR LOVE KNEW NO BOUNDSIn a land of raw winds and merciless sun, Marybeth MacKinder was a green eyed, red-haired young widow traveling westward with her late husband's family and the memories of a loveless marriage. Here she was losing the battle to protect herself and her 5- month infant son from the brutish brother-in-law who was trying to claim her as his own. Then Joshua Rivers stood before her offering her a tenderness she had never felt. He was a man of the frontier, a man both tough and gentle, whose very touch gave her a thrill she had never known. As the wagon train pushed across a continent, Marybeth would see new horizons opening up before her and feel a passion-bred courage to face both danger and a new destiny. But the joy she felt in Joshua's arms would be threatened by savage jealousy -- and a bullet ... for the journey of her heart had just begun.",
