  "description": "Obligation - an act or course of action to which a person is morally or legally bound; a duty or commitment.As soon as I saw her, I knew exactly who she was. A snake, born with venom in her blood and poison in her veins.I’m Clay Jansen, a king among men. But wearing the crown means dealing with the duty and expectation that’s been mine since birth.January Burke is nothing more than an obligation; a business deal that was sealed with vows not contracts.But my poisonous new bride is a snake, bred from a den of vipers.Family expectation might have forced me to entwine my life with hers, but I won’t be taken in by the good girl façade she’s wearing.So I watch her. Play with her until I know every move she makes, and every word she says. But once I see her, it’s impossible to look away.Freedom is all she craves and the only thing I can’t give her.I should let her go, but I couldn’t if I tried.Obligation has become obsession… and she’s all mine.",
