  "description": "Ben and I are just friends.We've tried to be more, but it never works. There's no chemistry between us.At least that's the story I tell everyone.Truth is, I'm pining for Ben. HARD. Like Taylor Swift, You Belong With Me, hard. I don't know what happened. Suddenly, his casual touch is fire, and his easy smile stops my heart.But Ben has put me in the friend zone. Permanently. His supermodel girlfriend and him setting me up with a pro football player confirm this.It's time to bury these feelings. Lock them up. A famous pro athlete is exactly what I need to get over my infatuation. Except Ben isn't making things easy. He's leveled up his touching and flirtingâ€”all good stuff unless you're trying to move on with your life.So what's a girl to do? Confess my feelings and risk losing my best friend? Or keep on pretending and end up with the wrong man?Complete is a friends-to-lovers, laugh-out-loud love story that keeps the romance closed-door. It's book three in The Sweet Rom \"Com\" Series but can be read as a standalone.",
