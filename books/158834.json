  "description": "Before, I was never the life of the party. I was the reliable one. The one no one had to worry about. The one no one had to think about. I was the one that everyone could ignore. Until that night, when everything changed and I finally became someone. Someone special. Someone noticeable.  Someone Carson might actually care about, as much as I cared about him. But the cost of being someone is more than anyone can imagine. For every moment, thereâ€™s a price to pay. For every party. For every choice made. For every kiss. Ultimately, living a life of PURE ECSTASY might be no different from not living at all.",
