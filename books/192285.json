  "description": "Twenty-four hours earlier the world was a pristine, productive, demon-free society and Sybille Malone an unknown Region One Fabric Counsel designer. Global Good's curator and guardian of banished relics warehoused in the Arctic Region, Eston Cote, needs to act fast. As Global Good's North Quad leader, he must prepare his colleagues in the other three Quadrants of the world for something they have never known... warfare. Celestial warfare. A fight for souls. Eston has discovered Sybille's connection to a chain of supernatural events that not only caused planetary earthquakes, but unleashed the Holy Warrior St. Michael the Archangel and his enemies. Michael's sole mission is to defend Sybille's calling, slaying the hounds of hell who threaten to possess the citizens of her world. Divinely foreseen and journaled by 21st century teenager St. Blair, Sybille's only hope of reining in the evil she unleashed on September 14, 2202, is to follow the directives of Blair and the saints before the demonic possessions outnumber the innocents.The St. Blair series is author Emily Skinner's first YA series.",
