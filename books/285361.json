  "description": "One of Jean de Brunhoff's five original Babar stories, Babar and His Children tells how the royal elephant and Queen Celeste await the birth of their first child... and discover to their surprise that they have three! The loyal townsfolk bring gifts, and the babies are named before being weighed by wise Dr. Capoulosse (he of the stern expression and pince-nez). Then it's time for young Flora, Pom, and Alexander to get into a series of scrapes and be saved by the bravery and good sense of either their parents or other animals. Brunhoff's charming, faintly Edwardian illustrations never cease to capture the imagination, and this particular story has something in it for every member of a young family--even if some members of your family are merely human. (Ages 2 to 6) --Richard Farr",
