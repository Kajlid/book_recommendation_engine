  "description": "A socially awkward widow is forced to take boarders into her Paris home, in this smart, witty novel of love, loneliness, friendship, and metamorphosis.Living in France among people she hardly understands, Annie has had trouble leaving the house since the death of her husband. And since home happens to be a small place nestled in the heart of Paris, why would she ever want to? But when unexpected events threaten her beloved home, Annie has no choice but to find lodgers—quickly.After placing an ad, Annie attracts tenants with the kind of baggage she isn’t prepared for: a long-legged, cool-headed ex-model on the run from her abusive husband; a frail young woman harboring a possible death wish; a mysterious artist; and an infuriating blue-blooded Frenchman—and all soon threaten Annie’s way of life in ways she never anticipated.But when Annie finds herself reluctantly but actively engaged in the lives of her tenants she discovers she might just free herself in the process . . .",
