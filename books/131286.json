Matt Leutte, Charlie Chester, Ed Jameson, and Rain Kaudenne. What were they like before they've became “Four Parts of the Universe”?These four prequels are in fact independent novellas about some important moments in life. Some are funny, some are deep and even tragic, some may help you take a look at the past.Thank you for downloading, enjoy the moments, spent with Four Parts!",
