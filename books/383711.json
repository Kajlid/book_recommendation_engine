  "description": "It’s been eight years since Jake Montgomery last came home. Eight years since he last laid eyes on Kristin Cooper, his best friend’s little sister. Only this time she's no giggling teenager. She's a beautiful, sexy woman - one with seduction on her mind. Kristin spent years fantasizing about having hot, steamy sex with her brother’s best friend. Jake's recent divorce leaves him fair game. But it also leaves him leery of trusting his heart again. Determined to live out her wildest dreams, she sets out to prove to Jake that she's the right woman for him - both in bed and out.",
