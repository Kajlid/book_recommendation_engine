  "description": "A Political Romantic SuspenseThere’s a name for girls like me: Sugar Baby. I’m used to being passed around the sexually depraved, middle-aged senators of Washington D.C. like candy, but when I meet him - the mysterious man who buys my exclusivity for three months for price that should frighten me more than his demands - everything changes.He's younger than the others. His touch is softer. His lips sweeter. His need fiercer. He has only one requirement...A blindfold to protect his identity... and to protect me from the danger I'd face if our affair leaked to the world.No phones. No light. No real names. He says I'm his dark paradise, and we have to keep it that way. He promises I'll thank him someday.But what is he really hiding? And what happens if I find out?AUTHOR'S NOTES:1. This is a standalone, full-length romance with HEA and NO cliffhanger. It will not become a series, and there is no bonus content included. What you see is what you get. :-)2. If you're looking for a true-to-life political thriller, this isn't it. If you want a forbidden political romance with twists, turns, suspense, and a generous amount of steamy love scenes, then this is your book. As my heroine says, \"The fantasy is always better than the reality.\" Happy reading! xoxo",
