  "description": "Second chances don’t come around every day, but Tucker Weston is mine. Ten years ago Tucker reeled me in with his sexy smolder. But he cut me loose after I fell hard for him that summer on my family’s ranch. I left without looking back. Went to chase my dreams and became Sam Ryker, world champion bull rider. But I never forgot the first man I loved. Now, I’m back at my family’s ranch and he’s here in front of me, just as rugged and hot as he’s always been. And though I’ve sworn to hate him for breaking my heart, I want him more than I should. All those promises I made to myself fly right out the window. Because when I'm near him, I can’t think. I can’t make the right choices. Trouble is, my family needs me here, and I can't afford a distraction like Tucker Weston. It'll cost more than my heart this time around. But all it takes is one kiss before he's got me roped tight yet again. Roped Tight is a standalone M/M romance set in the Ryker Ranch world.",
