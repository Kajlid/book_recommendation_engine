  "title": "The Lottery",
  "description": "The Lottery , one of the most terrifying stories written in this century, created a sensation when it was first published in The New Yorker . \"Power and haunting,\" and \"nights of unrest\" were typical reader responses. This collection, the only one to appear during Shirley Jackson's lifetime, unites \"The \" with twenty-four equally unusual stories. Together they demonstrate Jackson's remarkable range--from the hilarious to the truly horrible--and power as a storyteller.",
