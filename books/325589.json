  "description": "Alexei Nikolaev.Blessed with the face of Adonis.Cursed with eyes colder than the Arctic and a past he can’t escape.His history is as tragic as a Dostoyevsky tale.He’s been on the FBI’s radar for years but has managed to always stay a step ahead and just out of their grasp.When I’m forced to work with him, fire ignites and things spiral out of control. Despite the desire felt from his mouthwatering body, covered in tattoos, distrust between us is deep.But unless we learn to work together and trust each other, we’re both as good as dead.This is a mature adult romance, and contains dubious situations and triggers that some readers might find offensive.",
