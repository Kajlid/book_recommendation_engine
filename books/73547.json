  "title": "Mass Murder",
  "description": "When a woman is found dead, hanging by her bra strap in the supply closet of the Catholic monastery, Detective Giorgio Salvatori is called in to handle the case. As a veteran New York police detective, he's been faced with some of the worst humanity has to offer. In fact, he moved to this small town in Southern California to get away from the dirt and crime of New York after a shooting nearly killed him. But he has a bad feeling about this case. Soon, his suspicions are borne out when a second body is found buried on the property, and days later, one of the monks is found floating face down in the duck pond. To complicate matters, the specter of a young boy who committed murder and then suicide back in the 1940s, appears to be communicating a message of some sort. But what is it? And does this decades-old murder have anything to do with Salvatori's current investigation?",
