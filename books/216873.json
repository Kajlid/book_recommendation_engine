She has always known that their world holds secrets behind the veil of normality—having her own Guardian Angel, Michael, ‘on call’ all her life has been a massive indicator of that.Desperate to know the fate of her father, Helena convinces Michael to take her into the Angel Realm to get her answers. Under strict instruction to touch nothing, Helena feels strange power take hold of her and manipulate her into doing quite the opposite.Who could ever guess that one brush of a fingertip over a shimmering soul-string could flip your world upside down and inside out?In that one passing second, Helena puts everyone she loves in danger by setting her path to cross with dangerous monsters and…something that has hunted her bloodline for centuries.Coming across the handsome yet mysterious vampire Lucious, she thinks he can save her from the darkness threatening to devour her very essence. What she doesn’t know is that the merciless Vampire Council is hunting Lucious for his own sinister secrets.With not one but two enemies encroaching, her angel missing, and overwhelming emotions stripping the barriers between her and Lucious, can she fight the attraction between them whilst trying to survive, or will she succumb to the ominous force grasping at the edges of her being?",
