  "title": "Mary Queen of Stoats: Robert the Goose and William Water-horse",
  "description": "Humorous rhyming stories which parody the lives of great Scottish heroes of the past. Mary Queen of Stoats follows Mary from a troubled pup, crowned queen just one week old to her struggles against Liz the First, the weasel Queen of England. Though guaranteed historically inaccurate, its a great light-hearted introduction to these historical figures which will bring a smile to the face of readers of any age. Robert the Goose chronicles the life and mis-adventures of a young gosling with spindly legs as he battles for the Scottish crown and to win the freedom of his native fowl against the tyrant drake King Edward the first. The final installment William Water-horse lifts the lid on the secrets and true nature of the Loch Ness monster. Also known as a kelpie or water-horse - the secrets of the identity and concealment of this practical joker across the ages are finally laid bare!",
