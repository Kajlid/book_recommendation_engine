  "description": "The genius, the ex-jock, and a new playbook…George-My brother’s friend is hot—if you’re into flannel-wearing lumbersexual former jocks who eat donuts for dinner and still scribble to-do lists on their palms. I’m not. I’m a serious scientist in my final year of grad school. Okay, I admit I have few quirks of my own. I also have a broken truck and a boss who thinks I can help him find love. I’m in over my head. Help!Aiden-A few quirks? Really? George is the weirdest dude I know. He wears capes in public, brings a book everywhere he goes, and loves all things spooky. He’s also the smartest person on the planet—who somehow thinks I can help him write a How-To-Get-A-Date playbook for his boss. Yeah, that sounds suspicious. I know baseball; I don’t know anything about love. But I can’t say no. The thing is…I’ve always had a soft spot for George. But falling for my best friend’s brother is against the rules, isn’t it?Rules of Play is an MM bisexual awakening story where opposites attract and shenanigans ensue!",
