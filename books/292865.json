  "description": "Lucy, an actress who just can't get a break, is warm, funny, and a total addict for happy endings, except she can't seem to find one for her own life. When the devilishly handsome Byron appears, Lucy thinks she has fallen into her own personalised fairytale, except for the fact that Prince Charming turns out to be a little too bossy for our freewheeling heroine, who discovers she might just be better off with her ex-boyfriend - friendly, funny, familiar Tom. Set in the backstreets and bars of bohemian Melbourne, The Wish List captivates with its warmth, wit and energy.",
