  "description": "An ancient fundamentalist organization chooses to lash out against its enemies by conducting several simultaneous attacks across the globe. One of these assaults unleashes a deadly virus within the Pentagon, which sets off a chain reaction of events that the United States may not overcome.When the virus mutates beyond anything the terrorists expect, the nation's capital is plunged into a violent zombie outbreak that threatens to infect everyone in the region. A desperate, misguided attempt to stop the potential global epidemic backfires as the undead survive the brutal pre-emptive strike and continue to wreak havoc on the human population when they reemerge from the bowels of the ruined city.Grayson Donnelly, a former Army officer who is stranded in the Midwest during the outbreak, is forced to fight for his life and for the survival of his adopted community while his fianc√©e Emory is trapped in the Washington, D.C. quarantine zone. She struggles to come to terms with her own survival while living in a government-operated refugee camp just outside of the city.Both Grayson and Emory must learn to adapt and do whatever is necessary in order to survive in a nation that is nearing anarchy as the terrorists' heinous scheme takes on a life of its own.",
