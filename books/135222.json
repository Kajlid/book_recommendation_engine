  "description": "Joey is a normal kid. He has a talking dog, a smart-alecky bird guardian, a ton of really cool magic, and his mom is a wood elf who was sucked through a portal the day he was born.  Well, maybe I’m a little off on the normal stuff. The truth is, the only thing normal about Joey is his new dad, and of course his friends from the orphanage. Otherwise his life is pretty strange.  The EVERWUD adventure continues as Joey and his friends discover spectacular new magic, deal with bullies, open doors that will absolutely knock their socks off, and ask the question we all want to know. What is a green witch?  And then there’s a clown… What the heck happened to normal? Find out in EVERWUD… where adventure begins.",
