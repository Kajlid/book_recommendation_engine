  "title": "This is London",
  "description": "A vacation in Paris inspired Miroslav Sasek to create childrens [sic] travel guides to the big cities of the world. He brought me 'This is Paris' in 1958 when I when I was publishing in London, and we soon followed up with 'This is London'. Both books were enormously successful, and his simple vision grew to include more than a dozen books. Their amusing verse, coupled with bright and charming illustrations, made for a series unlike any other, and garnered Sasek (as we always called him) the international and popular acclaim he deserved.I was thrilled to learn that 'This is London' will once again find its rightful place on bookshelves. Sasek is no longer with us (and I have lost all contact with his family), but I am sure he would be delighted to know that a whole new generation of wide-eyed readers is being introduced to his whimsical, imaginative, and enchanting world.",
