  "description": "[Siren Menage Amour 36: Menage a Trois Romance, M/F/M] Boone and Chase Jackson have managed to avoid Rachel Robinson for months, although it wasn't easy. She's a forever kind of woman and they've been burned too badly in the past to ever want a commitment again. When Rachel gives up on them, though, they're not happy. Seeing that other men have decided to move on her, they give her a night she'll never forget. But they all get more than they bargained for when Rachel discovers she's pregnant. The men are quick to throw off their fears and make her their own. But she doesn't believe them. Deciding their desire to commit is only for the baby's sake, Rachel refuses to believe that it's her they want. But the passion between the three of them is hotter than ever. When the pregnancy is in danger, can she and her lovers still have a future?",
