  "description": "The story your mother never told you-printed here for your own good. Lois Lenz was like any other wholesome former cheerleader with a knack for office skills-until she took a job at Sather & Sterling in bustling Bay City. Spending her days in the cut-throat typing pool and her nights at the all-women's residence of Magdalena Arms, Lois had no idea she was entering a world of working girls whose passionate desires-and fabulous fashion sense-could lead any innocent lamb astray . . . Netta-serious and smart, she's unlike any woman Lois has known . . . Maxie-The height of society fashion, and girls are so very in style . . . Pamela-Lois's old high school Pep Squad pal certainly has changed . . . Miss Gill-the office manager has secrets and plenty of file cabinets to keep them in . . . Dolly-an actress whose martini shaker is as busy as her love life . . . Mrs. Pierson- \"The hyena\" Lois's boss, her office is a place of hard work and private dictation . . . And many more! Lois Lenz-she was a good girl a long way from home about to discover that not everything is what it seems, navy is a bad suit choice, and love can bloom in the strangest of places . . .",
