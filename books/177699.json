  "description": "No animals were harmed as the cover and title might indicate. MMA fighting is only going to become much hotter! Yes, we are talking about fighter names...Little Fox is the sister of the fighter, Sly Fox and The Hunter is his biggest rival. With a suite mix-up at one of the biggest MMA fighting tournaments, Trevor 'The Hunter' Dale, finds a distraction in his room, in the form of Maya 'Little Fox' Bischoff. The situation pushes both into a world of revelations and soon it is clear that the attraction needs to be avoided. Trevor though, decides it is time for a change and Maya's reluctance toward him, only makes it more fun. When Maya does give in, her brother, Charlie, is all too pleased and suspicions grow as the media goes on a frenzy, in digging out the skeletons. In the short period of the tournament, Trevor realises, very quickly, that Maya is definitely what he needs in his future, but as with any bout, the end is never a definite one without someone being knocked out.",
