  "description": "We're all monsters.  In IN AND OF BLOOD, Kat Lewis uses beautifully violent language to prove that there is no good or evil - only circumstances. As her characters try to mitigate their immorality and point fingers to say that their monstrosity is no worse than others', Lewis splays a truth about the human condition across each page.  Her stories, \"Six Weeks of Solitude\" and \"Jello Shots and Shopping Carts\" focus on the psychological monsters of hate and self-destruction. Lewis turns to physical monsters with the resurrection of a teenage girl in \"#324\" and the personification of death as a fisherman in \"Hook, Line, and Dead.\" The title story, \"In and of Blood,\" explores the lives of two werewolf sisters as one sister embraces her feral nature and lives as a wolf while the other rejects her inner creature and struggles to live as a human.  Visceral, vicious, and unwavering, IN AND OF BLOOD captivates as it comments on the monstrosity inside us all and reminds us that sometimes it's okay to be a monster.",
