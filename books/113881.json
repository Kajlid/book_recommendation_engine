  "title": "SCARS",
  "description": "These creative musings and meanderings are a summary of the years spent in the ephemeral city of Bombay, the idyllic city of Calcutta and the utopian dream that is Darjeeling. The struggle for survival, existence and expression is actually a paradox and the yardstick for success depends on you, the individual and your aspirations. You can shape your own yardstick or become its victim knowingly. This has been a great learning experience for me, in human relationships. Scars is the big picture which has emerged as a result. I dedicate these reflections to all those trapped in successful webs of their own.",
