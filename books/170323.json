  "description": "Cory Woodford, aka \"The Kid\", is determined to live up to his intimidating family legacy of bravery. While his father is off fighting in World War II, eleven-year-old Cory and his friends spend the summer building go-carts, drawing comics, playing baseball . . . and tracking down Nazi spies. Right and wrong are more complicated than in Cory's beloved comics, and he and his friends soon learn that the world isn't as black and white as they thought. In an age when friendships are deep and complex, Cory makes mistakes and hurtful decisions. Based on the author's personal experience and research, Woodford Brave is a deeply satisfying novel of summer and friendship, but also explores what it means to be a son, a friend, a neighborâ€”and truly brave. Includes an author's note and selected bibliography.",
