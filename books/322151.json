  "description": "What’s a woman supposed to do after watching her cheating ex's wedding implode?Apparently, the answer is get fired.And evicted.And move to another state to start over as an independent woman who would rather stick her tit in a beehive than get into another relationship.It’s fine. Really. The only thing messing with my new, badass, single girl life is an encounter with my childhood crush.Fine, maybe I was the one who suggested some bedtime fun. What I didn’t do was invite him to come along on a holiday weekend. I have Kasha to thank for that.Now, I’m doing my best to hang onto my determination to stay single. It’s hard. Pun intended.With Kasha and Henley along, things were destined to be chaotic, but some things I didn't see coming.Like a garbage skunk with killer aim.A broken penis that bears a resemblance to a crazy straw.And a man focused on winning my heart.",
