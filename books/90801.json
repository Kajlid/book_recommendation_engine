  "title": "Moving In: Tales of an Unlicensed Marriage",
  "description": "At a time when marriage equality has become a political and social hot topic, MOVING IN: Tales of an Unlicensed Marriage is an expose on relationships and renovation. The story shows that, no matter same or opposite gender, there’s one in every couple who likes to make things look pretty and one who’ll walk across a newly cleaned kitchen floor in muddy shoes to see the results. MOVING IN features the tale of Bruce and Scott’s freshman year of happy homemaking, during which time they: learn how to operate a lawnmower and that they shouldn’t; debate whether to go to the emergency room after their 1929 oven burns off Bruce’s eyebrow; invite a fugitive over for a beer; and almost strangle each other with Christmas lights. As they say, marriage is made in heaven, but then again, so is thunder, lightning, and hail. This book is fun from cover to cover and will definitely make you feel better about your own relationship. Grab yourself a glass of wine and settle in to your side of the bed for a good read. But be warned, you’re about to be told to keep the laughter down.",
