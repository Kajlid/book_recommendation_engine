  "description": "Is it possible for a Beta werewolf to have a human mate, or must Justin Ruel give up the woman he loves?Tareth McConnell has learned not to count on anyone other than herself, and really isn't in the market for a relationship. But the first time she sees the man with his long hair in a braid on the subway, she's strangely drawn to him. Despite that, a month passes before they say more than hello to each other.The first time Justin Ruel speaks with Tareth, he knows there's something special about her. Something different. If he didn't know better, he would swear she was his mate. But Justin is the Beta of the City Pack, the largest werewolf pack in New England, and there's no possible way he could have a human mate. At first, Justin tries to hide the truth from Tareth. When a series of attacks occur on pack members, Tareth's life might be endangered, and Justin has no choice but to tell her--even if that means losing her forever.",
