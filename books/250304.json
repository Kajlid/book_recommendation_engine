  "description": "Michelle Buchanan wasn't looking for the perfect man to fill her life.  She'd settle for Mr. Right Now to fill the empty spot in her bed - just someone that could help her with the little problem of her lingering virginity.  But when Luka Templeton invaded her blind date and suddenly begins taking over her every waking thought, she realizes that she is in way too deep with the confident alpha male currently wreaking havoc on her life.  Join us on this romantic comedy romp as Chelle and Luka find their way to happily ever after!           Romantic comedy.  Releases on April 3 as part of Aurora Rose Reynold's Happily Ever After Kindle World.  (And if you've read Aurora's Until series, you'll know Chelle from Until Ashlyn!)",
