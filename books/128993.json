After winning her talisman back in the Everwild, the Dark Witch Hekate has hidden the key that will unlock Pandora’s Box deep in the heart of the Deadlands. Concealed within a volcano, the Deadlands is a place known of eternal condemnation of the fiercest, foulest creatures on Earth. Yet, not everything is what it seems. The Deadlands have been civilized and are being ruled by the Deadland King, who has joined forces with Hekate and is planning to unleash an army to dominate all races. Willow learns that Declan is hiding a little secret of his own, and the connection between Elirana and Chase is revealed. But battling evil creatures and reaching the heart of the Deadlands is not Willow’s only problem. The problem is…how will she find the key and make it out alive when fate takes a turn for the worse?",
