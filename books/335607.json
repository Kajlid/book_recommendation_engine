  "description": "The shadows. The darkness. The underworld has always been my home. But I don’t tolerate any male giving any woman any kind of grief which is why I offer my services discreetly. I’m curious, and can’t resist seeing who requests my help, although I have no interest in interacting with some college kid. Until I see her. And everything changes. But then she flips around and does something foolish. Women are special, and this one, this Sapphire, is a cut above all the others…willing to search for a very alternative solution to her problem. Me. I will swiftly and resolutely put an end to her troubles then I will show her what happens when you try to pull a fast one on me. I can’t, and I won’t, hurt her but I will show her who's boss. Show her that with a little pain there can be a whole lot of pleasure. For her, I will close one chapter of my life forever, so I can start an entirely new book with her. She is meant for me and she will be mine. Mine to care for and mine to protect. Always.",
