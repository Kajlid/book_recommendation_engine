  "description": "For Kenna Carter, life is simple. Kill the monsters, close the breaches, collect a pay-check and keep her secret safe...until fate decides to be a bitch...  Kenna Carter is one of the chosen. Branded by fate as Fearless, she and her companions patrol the night and keep the city of Lindrealm free from otherworld denizens. Any pocket of darkness, any nook or cranny can spawn a breach, allowing hungry monsters from the Evernight to come crawling though. A reluctant treaty with Erebus and his clan of dark djinn offers protection from the worst of the monsters, and maintains the balance needed to keep Lindrealm safe. But fate has other plans for Kenna.  One night, one mission, and her life is thrown off course.  Broken and filled with despair, Kenna finds herself in Erebus’s world, a place of eternal darkness and enchantments. A prisoner or a guest, she isn’t quite sure, but with the help of a guardian angel and a talking gargoyle she hopes to find out just where she fits in the grand scheme of things, because Kenna has a secret destiny. One that she is about to discover could require the ultimate sacrifice. But when the time comes, will Kenna make the right choice?",
