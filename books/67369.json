  "description": "The world, which was not so long ago idyllic and untroubled, has become a place rent with malevolence and strife. Humanity is now an insatiable race, steadfast on procuring more — more status, more wealth, more power. These hungers are particularly evident in the dusty nowhere of Cedar City. A town of bondage, it’s here that men and women journey to trade product for flesh. The slaves purchased are then scattered across the nation, put to work in factories, on farms, or in the homes of the affluent. Hanson Barrett is an altruistic but, at times, foolhardy young man, living in Cedar City. The iniquitous affairs of the place he calls home have always caused him disquiet, and he’s long thought of pulling up stakes and leaving it all behind. Inevitably, though, along with slipping morality comes subsequent tumult. When a wealthy aeroship baron and his exquisite wife float into the burg to do business, things in the well-oiled machine that is Cedar City begin to unravel like a ball of redemptive yarn.",
