  "description": "In Call To Crusade, Tom Vetter begins the Siege Master series, the epic story of the First Crusade told as never before: as lived by a knight who battles Turks, traitors, starvation and death itself itself to win a crusade and regain holy Jerusalem.. The year is 1070. King Malcolm of Scotland has finally reached a peace of sorts with William, Norman conqueror of England. To his battle companion, Baron Euan MacDougal and wife Lady Mildred, companion of Queen Margaret, is born son Godric MacEuan. Raised, educated and trained to knighthood amid the royal family's princes, Godric's life is ideal.Then Sir Euan and Lady Mildred die tragically, leaving 11-year old Godric in the hands of his evil older half-brother, Andrew, who hates Godric and resents the favor he has with the Scottish royals.Andrew enslaves Godric as a blacksmith, and his future looks bleak. But the son of a great knight will stay no slave, and Godric frees himself and his friends by his own hand.His fortunes restored, Godric becomes a squire under Count Robert of Flanders, a Peer of France, accompanying the great count on his historic pilgrimage to Jerusalem. That journey, the men who make it and the deeds they perform ultimately set the world afire and launch the First Crusade. And though he is only a squire, it is Godric’s deeds that put the match to the fuse.A gripping story of faith, bravery, and holy war for a worthy cause, Call to Crusade sets the stage. In the Siege Master series, readers will relive the entire First Crusade at Godric’s side and rediscover why this forgotten conflict still matters so much to every person living today.PRAISE FOR THE SIEGE MASTER TALES\"The research is solid, the characters believable. Tom Vetter shows, not tells, his story in a very distinctive voice. I laughed and cried and really, really enjoyed it. There's so much humor, action and hidden truth in there. The story is gripping and won't let the reader go. My husband can’t wait to read it.” - Katharina Gerlach, author and publisher, IndependentBookworm.com",
