  "description": "ElijahA straight man walks into a gay bar…It sounds like The Stand-Up Club on open mic night.But it was the night my all-time crush walked into my life, and it ended up being a lot more than a joke.I was supposed to be his birthday gift—specifically my mouth.Nothing more, nothing less.But this was James Delaney. A man I’d fantasised about for years.I should have walked away. I’m sure that’s what you would have done. Me? I decided I could handle a hot encounter with the man of my dreams and walk away with nothing but fond memories.Big mistake…huge. I don’t recommend it. It messes with the brain's ability to maintain internal homeostasis – a conscious decision to remain aloof.It turns out the real James Delaney had more in mind. But stuff like that only happens in fairy tales, not to a Queer like me.JamesMy straight best friend dragged me to a gay bar to celebrate my birthday. It was the last thing I wanted. I prefer bars with quiet music, craft beers and the ability to blend in.I’m a planner, not a fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants kind of bloke, and I didn’t need my best friend interfering with my well-constructed life. Or buying me a “sexual experience” to galvanise me out of a rut. I was happy with maintaining the status quo – successful business, tick, dependable companion, tick, living under the radar, tick. Elevator music is not so bad.Until Elijah Battersea shook my life up into a wild Glastonbury-like rock festival. Chaotic, messy, and loud. And I loved it. The only thing I had to do was convince him that it wasn’t just a fairy tale.*** Pretty Elijah is a Cinderella-esque, close proximity, sweet steamy love story.",
