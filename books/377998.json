  "description": "Lonely, storm-swept, silent, the ruin of Saint Martin's Abbey has earned quite a reputation. Mention it to the locals, they'll give you an odd look and say, \"You know it's haunted.\"Rick Gray buys a cottage in a nearby village, looking for peace and quiet to find himself after years in the tough trade of the pro photographer. Sundown brings a storm -- perfect lighting conditions for the spectacular images that made him famous. Against advice, he heads to the abbey to work fast while the light holds...When it fades, a fragment of the mystery of St. Martin's lies in his hands. The man calls himself John -- just John. For Rick, it's love a first sight.The next twenty-four hours will be beyond anything he ever imagined. If he hadnâ€™t seen it, felt it all, with his own senses, he would never have believed. But seeing ... feeling ... is believing. Co-written with Jayne DeMarco.",
