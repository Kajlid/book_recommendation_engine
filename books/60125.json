  "description": "The last thing Adria expects to find when she arrives at her vacation rental is a man in her front yard—unconscious and stark naked. But something else sets him apart from most strangers. He is no ordinary man. Toren is new to Earth, framed for a crime he didn’t commit and banished to this planet to serve his sentence. He’s desperate to return to his planet, because the magic that is part of him will soon disappear, and along with it, all of his memories. Adria is his only hope to help make his escape for home—and as fate would have it, his reason to stay.",
