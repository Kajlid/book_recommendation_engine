  "description": "Aleksey doesn’t like helpful sayings. He particularly doesn’t like Ben Rider-Mikkelsen pointing out that paranoid men can’t see the wood for the trees. There’s a truth to these wise words, however, that applies directly to him—when you’re paranoid that everyone is out to kill you, those who actually are can be easily overlooked. But for once, Aleksey ignores his instincts that something is threatening the family. Tired of fighting windmills, imaginary or otherwise, he decides it’s time to kick back and just enjoy being Lord of Light Island. He should perhaps have remembered another helpful saying: the tide always turns.",
