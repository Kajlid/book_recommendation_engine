When asked by his former commander, Colonel Trautman, to accompany him on a top-secret mission into Soviet occupied Afghanistan, Rambo refuses. But when he learns that Trautman is captured by the Soviets and is being held prisoner in a hellish medieval prison Rambo once again picks up his guns and goes on a desperate one-man rescue mission. This time Rambo won't be fighting for himself or a government. This time Rambo is fighting for a friend and freedom. John Rambo is coming to Afghanistan and Hell is coming with him!",
