  "description": "AAAAHHH....HELP! HELP! SOMETHING’S GOT ME!” screamed Flop. Horrified, Diz watched as the ground swallowed his best friend, replacing him with a cloud of dust. He could hear him but he couldn’t see him! The others heard Flop screaming and dashed to the edge of the slope to see what had happened. Logan almost slid down the slope just as Flop had but Jackson grabbed him in time, pulling him back... Hang on as you experience this roller coaster ride for dear life! This sometimes-brave group of seven friends dodges death at every turn while learning about true friendship, courage, truth, and hope... as in the hope of getting out alive! “I’ve used many children’s novels to teach students as an elementary educator of 31 years. I certainly wish I had been able to use this one. Jackson’s Raiders has adventure, action, a treasure hunt, and a bit of the supernatural - and teaches some history as well! What more could a teacher or parent ask of a book?” —Debbie Phillips, MA Literature, Editor",
