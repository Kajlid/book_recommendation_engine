  "description": "Ruth Sawyer's This Way To Christmas tells the story of David, who is sent away from his family because of the first world war. Irish Johanna, David's old nurse, regards the other people on their isolated mountain as heathen. David finds companionship by visiting them, hearing their stories of Christmas, and retelling their stories to his hosts. David, who is younger and less prejudiced, communicates a vision of their shared humanity to his elders.",
