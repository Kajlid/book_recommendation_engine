When ghostly moans lead them to the attic of the old house in Paris, they discover Felix de La Morte, who has lingered there for hundreds of years, waiting for the return of a certain comet. With the comet due to return the very next day, the poor fellowâ€™s telescope has been stolen by mean Lord Cucuface, and it is up to Madeline and Pepito to get it back.
