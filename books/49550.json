  "description": "When Ben knelt down on one knee and asked me to marry him I thought “how exciting, I get to marry the man of my dreams and plan a wedding!” I mean how hard can it be? Pick a colour theme, some dresses, flowers and say ‘I do’ right? Wrong, well for me it wasn't that simple anyway, I had many challenges to face. Planning my wedding was one of the biggest learning experiences of my life. Now I have made it past the 'I do' and am happily married I really want to share my experience with others so they can enjoy the process and avoid some of the stressful situations I confronted.If you’re not hiring a professional wedding planner my first piece of advice is to get yourself a wedding planner book and tick tasks off as you go. Also, listen to people’s advice but make sure you don’t let anyone tell you what to do, and make sure you stay positive because this is YOUR big day to shine!",
