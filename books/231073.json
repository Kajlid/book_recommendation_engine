  "description": "All Morna Conall wants is freedom—freedom to practice and learn about the magic inside her. Perhaps then her world wouldn’t feel so small. When she finds the spell books and journals of an old mentor, Morna believes she’s found the key to her happiness, but when she crosses paths with an injured man in need of help, her plans are derailed. As she spends more time with the strange but alluring man, her dreams change. Maybe magic isn’t the only thing capable of expanding her world. Jerry never expected anything other than an ordinary existence. When he wakes one morning to find himself in a different century, he embarks on one of the most baffling and difficult years of his life. He spends every day searching for a way to return home, but when the only person he believes can help him perishes in a fire, he worries he will be trapped in the past forever. His hope returns when a beautiful lass offers him aid, but with each passing day, he finds himself less sure of his desire to return home. The witch occupies his every thought. If she does find a way to send him home, it will mean leaving his heart hundreds of years in the past.",
