  "description": "These thirty stories, selected and introduced by Michael Gilbert, are concerned with murder, criminal acts and the law and can be dipped into in any order. 'The Rivals' contains a real puzzle; 'Name of Smith' features a judge's summing-up and a murder; 'The Story of Hermione' has a criminal who escapes altogether. The law is the linking thread, along with Cyril Hare's ingeniousness.Legal“WHERE THERE’S A WILL——”MISS BURNSIDE’S DILEMMANAME OF SMITHMURDERER’S LUCKTHE TRAGEDY OF YOUNG MACINTYREMurderWEIGHT AND SEE“IT TAKES TWO . . .”DEATH OF A BLACKMAILERTHE OLD FLAME“AS THE INSPECTOR SAID . . .”DEATH AMONG FRIENDSTHE STORY OF HERMIONEA SURPRISE FOR CHRISTMASTHE HEELTHE RIVALSTHE RULING PASSIONTHE DEATH OF AMY ROBSARTOther CrimesI NEVER FORGET A FACEA LIFE FOR A LIFETHE MARKHAMPTON MIRACLEA VERY USEFUL RELATIONSHIPSISTER BESSIELINE OUT OF ORDERDROPPER’S DELIGHTThe ChildrenMONDAY’S CHILDTUESDAY’S CHILDWEDNESDAY’S CHILDTHURSDAY’S CHILDFRIDAY’S CHILDSATURDAY’S CHILD.........",
