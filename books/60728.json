  "description": "There is a question that everybody, at least once in a lifetime, must have come up with: if you had the opportunity to, what would you change in your life? If you had to do it again, what remorse, what regret would you choose to obliterate?Elliott has been professionally very successful. He is a sixty-year-old famous surgeon who lives in San Francisco and whose private life is illuminated by his daughter Angie. He would be perfectly happy if Ilena, the woman he was passionately in love with, hadn’t died thirty years before.One day, by a strange combination of circumstances, he is brought back to his own past and meets the young man he had been thirty years earlier. In that time, Elliott was a passionate, enthusiastic and ambitious young doctor. In San Francisco, where he met with Ilena, the Seventies were going full swing. Since then, the two Elliotts weirdly face each other behind close doors, in a succession of tender and intense moments which is the amazing fit of this novel and which characterizes the “Musso touch”, a mix of suspense and psychological appropriateness.",
