  "description": "Another heartwarming tale from the author of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. The story begins: \"In alluding to myself as a Goose Girl, I am using only the most modest of my titles; for I am also a poultry maid, a tend of Belgian hares and rabbits, and a shepherdess; but I particularly fancy the role of Goose Girl, because it recalls the German fairy tales of my early youth, when I always yearned, but never hoped, to be precisely what I now am.\"",
