  "description": "Logging Railroads of Weyerhaeuser\"s Vail-McDonald Operation covers the fascinating history of northwest railroad logging-including the Chehalis Western and Curtis, Milburn, & Eastern- as only Weyerhaeuser could do it. Starting with steam power and evolving to Diesel power, Weyerhaeuser harvested and transported logs for some 65 years via their Vail and McDonald operations. Authors Frank Telewski and Scott Barrett capture the story through detailed research and in depth interviews with many Weyerhaeuser employees who share their experiences of life and work in the woods. Thanks to noted northwest logging photographers Clark and Darius Kinsey, you'll find a host of imagery inside, many never before published, including Shay, Climax,Heisler, and rod locomotives- featuring the second largest logging mallet ever built. Also depicted are the powerful steam donkeys and imposing tower skidders Weyerhaeuser used to harvest the massive timbers that grew in Southwestern Washington State. Additional photography-371 in all-from noted photographers such as Harold Hill, Al Farrow, and many others along with 10 detailed drawings and 65 maps, illustrate the breadth and depth of Vail and McDonald. This book is a must for any logging enthusiast, model railroader, or forest historian.Although currently out-of-print the authors are considering publishing a revised edition with recently discovered new materials.",
