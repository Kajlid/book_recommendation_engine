  "description": "They say I’m a duchess: an omega who rejected my mates.It’s a title that lends me wealth and power. A perfect life. Yet, money can’t buy back my lost memories, and each night I dream of mates I can't remember, desperately wondering why I gave up what I desired most.But danger closes in, nameless and faceless: I'm being hunted by a ghost from the past. Terrified, and no longer safe in my own home, I do what I swore I'd never would: search for another pack for protection.My money opens doors, and I go to The Institute in hopes of matching my scent with an upstanding pack.Blessedly, one scent is undeniable. Irresistible. A match—and this time for life.Until I learn of the mixup: Instead of eligible bachelors, I'm bound to a pack of criminals.Now I’m faced with an impossible choice: return home alone and hope my lost past won’t cost me everything, or put myself at the mercy of dangerous strangers…Content warnings: The book explores societal values around woman and childbearing (but not, specifically, the grief of infertility). Violence. Explicit spice. Mature readers only.",
