  "title": "Bird From Hell: And Other Mega Fauna",
  "description": "The First Nation or mountain people have provided the author with a detailed description of six huge species of animals, long thought to be extinct. These animals include two man-eating reptiles. The first is commonly referred to as the Thunderbird, also known as the flying dragon of Asia, the world's largest flying animal which hunts strictly in darkness, a reptile whose scientific name is the pterodactyl. The other reptile is the animal in Takla Lake which is very likely the same animal that is in Loch Ness. As well, at the end of the last Ice Age there was an extinction of mega fauna, including the Woolly Mammoth, which they refer to as the Hairy Elephant; the Cave Bear, which they call the Rubber Faced Bear; and the Dire Wolf, which they call the Wilderness Wolf. The world's largest ape, in fact the largest ape ever to walk the earth, twice the size of a gorilla is also included in the group of six species as well as a top predator in North America, commonly called Big Foot or Sasquatch. The First Nation people call them Stink People or Giants. This is a true accounting of these fascinating species.",
