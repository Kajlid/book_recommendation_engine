  "description": "Blood. Death. Sacrifice. They follow me around like shadows I’m desperate to outrun. My guys saved me once, but I don't need their help this time. I’m armed and dangerous and ready to put a bullet in anyone who gets in my way. This time there is no escaping my wrath. I don’t care if we’re related or if they are my boyfriend’s father, everyone will pay. They thought they could take my best friend, that it would force me to submit… They couldn’t be more wrong. To get her back, I must fulfill the contract hanging over my head. I'll do whatever it takes to get answers...but they come at a steep cost. How much am I willing to sacrifice for vengeance?",
