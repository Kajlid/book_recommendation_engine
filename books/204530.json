  "description": "“I hate you!” she shouted every night in Kane Holt’s dreams. His reaction was the same, shifting into his wolf, raging with pain and confusion. He had no idea who this woman was and why she hated him. All he knew was that he needed her and would do anything to find her. Months of dreaming and nothing changed. He was at his limit. How was he supposed to find her when he couldn’t make it past the pain? Sleepless nights were never-ending and effecting his everyday responsibilities. A simple and inconsequential decision to visit friends changed everything. On a big TV, there was his mate, the lovely Miss Denney. He ran to Hollywood in search of his other half and nothing was going to stop him. Would he get her to change his mind or would she still tell him to leave?",
