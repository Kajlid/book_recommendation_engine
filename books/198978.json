  "description": "Nerds, zombies, a pre-op transgender, crass juvenile humor, outdated pop culture references, lesbians, and badass ginger chicks with swords. Throw in a healthy dose of profanity, verbal jousting, teenage insecurity, regret and budding romances and you’ve got “Donna of the Not Undead”, the first installment of an unexpectedly heartfelt story of a group of socially awkward teens who find themselves fighting to survive in a world turned on its head. Fresh out of high school and ready to celebrate their recent commencement into the “real world” of small town eastern Kentucky life, Alex, Bryan, and Justin, along with the rambunctious twelve-year-old Brandon, enjoy an epic three day Dungeons and Dragons marathon in their basement only to emerge into a world that has inexplicably morphed into the plot of one of their favorite movie genres. Stranded and alone they quickly find themselves on a very real mission to rescue the buxom beauty Donna, a cheerleader and object of their high school fantasies who is trapped on the other side of town and is quite possibly the last hot chick alive on the planet. Fueled by teenage hormones run amok and fighting through hordes of terrifying undead zombies the boys join forces with a group of three fiery haired sisters, Darla, Carla and their spunky little sister Melody along with Helga their foreign exchange student friend who doesn’t speak a word of English. Raised by doomsday prepper parents to survive in a world gone crazy, the four girls, finding themselves stranded in the little town far from home, join the boys on their epic quest. Teaming up with the foul mouthed, pre-op transgender Suzie-Steve and her rotund cohort Fat Larry, the group fight against zombies and time to reach the curvaceous damsel in distress, Donna.",
