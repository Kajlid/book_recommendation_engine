  "description": "\"Nothing About This is Easy and Here is Why\" is a short book that has taken a lifetime to write. It is filled with little stories from Mari Stein's \"Autistic Brain.\" When she was a child there was no diagnosis for her, and her parents would not have spent the money on testing even if there was. This memoir is a testament to a misunderstood life and will help others recognize that they are not alone.",
