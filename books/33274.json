  "description": "A brief word from the characters: We seem to have a failure to communicate here. Hey, it's okay with us that Chicks in Chainmail was so popular, and reached Number 3 on the Locus bestseller list, and everybody wanted more, please. But people, you need to take us sword-swinging amazons a little more seriously. After all, you think it's a picnic wearing a cold brass brassiere (let alone finding the right size)? You think it's a piece of cake keeping those chainmail accessories from rusting when it rains? You think it's a walk in the park besieging a city when you've got PMS? Think again, you wimpy noncombatants!Sure, you're entitled to a laugh to two. Hey, we like a good joke as much as the next amazon. But hard experience has taught us that swordswomen don't get no respect. So, while you're chuckling, show some respect. You can start by buying this book. You were going to buy the book, weren't you? Pardon us a moment...have to wash the blood stains off these swords before they set...4 • No Pain, No Gain • [Ladies' Aid & Armor Society • 2] • (1998) • short story by Elizabeth Moon24 • Slue-Foot Sue and the Witch in the Woods • (1998) • short story by Laura Frankos32 • A Young Swordswoman's Garden Primer • (1998) • short story by Sarah Zettel48 • The Old Fire • (1998) • short story by Jody Lynn Nye65 • Like No Business I Know • (1998) • novelette by Mark Bourne92 • A Bone to Pick • [Vassilisa • 1] • (1998) • short story by Keith R.
