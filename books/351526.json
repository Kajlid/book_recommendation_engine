  "description": "LAPD cop Mickey Stanton knew the minute the new guy, Jeff Chandler, a transfer from Seattle PD ended up in his division, he was crazy about him. Ending up in the same patrol car working as partners, Mickey couldn’t believe his luck when one late evening at the end of shift, they revealed to each other their sexual preference. From that moment on, the two of them began a fiercely wild love affair which included risqué sex on duty.Craving Mick’s violent style of sex, Jeff knew he’d found a compatible partner on the job as well as in the bedroom, but after being burned by another lover, an officer in Seattle, Jeff was hesitant to commit to Mickey. Working long shifts, getting into dangerous situations together, Jeff trusted Mickey with his life, but not his heart. And Mickey craved that one true love, an exclusive pairing, and a life partner to share his life with. As the exhaustion and stress of the job compete with their volatile relationship, Mick and Jeff struggle to keep what they have alive as the battles between them are as passionate as the sexual bouts. Can the two big cats, the sworn officers of LAPD make it happen? Or will the job and the anger separate these top men? Sometimes the answer is sitting in a patrol car by your side.",
