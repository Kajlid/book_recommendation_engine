In the first book, Boy for the Cheer, Lee became involved in a girls cheerleading program where he was reluctantly introduced to crossdressing. Lee finds that he enjoys the softer side of clothing. Circumstances seem to be forcing Lee to wear a feminine wardrobe in more situations. Even his summer seems destined to steal any attempt at masculinity.  In Boy Can Cheer, Leeâ€™s choices in clothing and long hair lead to more complications in his life. Lee enters the dating scene and begins exploration of the relationships between boys and girls while finding himself further immersed in the cheerleading program.  When one of the competition cheerleaders gets injured before a major competition, they need a replacement who knows and can perform all the programs.  Every crossdresser has their own story of how their fetish developed. They also have a personal story on how they integrate crossdressing into their life.
