  "description": "Meet King Antiochus, coming very soon to an Apocalypse near you. When he died 21 centuries ago he never passed on; instead his spirit waited for resurrection. He's been preparing for his return, watching humanity until its fruit ripened ready to be harvested for the New Age. That time is now. But to Christians and Jews he can only be the Antichrist. It's a recipe for Armageddon.",
