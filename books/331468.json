  "description": "A chronic swooner, the man who catches her, and a goat.When Diane faints during her wedding vows, it's expected. Her family thinks almost everything is too stimulating for her because of her fainting condition. Of course they matched her with a man who couldn't make anyone's heart flutter. When her fiancé tries to make light of the situation by giving her a fainting goat, the ridicule is too much to bear. Diane wants more than the life before her— she wants to live the passion and adventure she’s only ever found in the erotic sketches she creates, and the kind of heart-racing feelings her fiancé’s cousin and best man Liam gives her. The last thing Diane expects as she flees from the church, however, is for the best man to run away with her.A Regency Era romance about secret erotic illustrations, a runaway bride, stolen carriages, tea garden deflowerings, and a fainting goat.
