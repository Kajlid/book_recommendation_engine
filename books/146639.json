  "description": "Moving on is not so easy!Carson Bell had a lovely voice, a heart of gold, and was no slouch in the looks department. He was single handedly bringing up his daughter, Mia, because his wife, Alice, abandoned them when Mia was just a baby.Alice decided to come back after ten years as part of her therapy. She had some things that she had to do: she would offer Carson a divorce so that he could move on with his life, and she would reconcile with those who had hurt her so she too could move on as well.What Alice hadn't banked on was how much she still loved Carson. Moving on would not be as easy as she thought.",
