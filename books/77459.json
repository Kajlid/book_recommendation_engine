  "description": "For those who love Bowie - a must - Mark RadcliffeSuperb - The WordThrilling...takes its place next to Revolution in the Head on the short shelf of necessary reading about pop. Praise doesn't come any higher - ObserverNo artist offered a more incisive and accurate portrait of the troubled landscape of the 1970s than David Bowie. Cultural historian Peter Doggett explores the rich heritage of Bowie's most productive and inspired decade, and traces the way in which his music reflected and influenced the world around him. From Space Oddity, his dark vision of mankind's voyage into the unknown terrain of space, to the Scary Monsters album, Doggett examines in detail Bowie's audacious creation of an \"alien\" rock star, Ziggy Stardust, and his increasingly perilous explorations of the nature of identity and the meaning of fame. Mixing brilliant musical critique with biographical insight and acute cultural analysis, the Man Who Sold the World is a unique study of a major artist and his times.An astonishing and absorbing work that expertly unpicks this explosively creative time in Bowie's life - Sunday TimesA fine song-by-song guide...This rich and well-researched book demands our attention - MojoCompels you to listen to Bowie's best-known songs afresh and his less obvious songs anew - Time Out",
