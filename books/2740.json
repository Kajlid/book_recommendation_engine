Now he lives by himself, eking out an existence as a freelance writer. His faith in God, humanity, and virtually everything else is gone. What's left is a pile of bills and the ache of his eldest son's death.

From her seemingly twisted account springs the potential media story of the century . . . and more trouble than Mac has ever imagined. In this engrossing page-turner, Mac follows his story to Israel, where he comes across the remains of one of the an ancient biblical giant, sired by demons and born of human women. Mac's encounter is just the tip of a terrifying supernatural iceberg --- for the nephilim are back on earth. And Mac has stumbled onto their secret. Nephilim winds from the Holy Land to the Nevada desert, through mind-numbing dangers and choices that will affect the future of the human race. Just one hope stands between Mac and the power of the risen Messiah. But can it save Mac and his children from the evil spiritual forces that spawned the nephilim? Or fulfill his agonizing quest for meaning and purpose in life?",
