  "description": "Will Merrin has everything one would think a 29-year-old man would want: Looks, health, self-confidence, a fast track career in business and an extremely well-paying job in a bustling East Coast City. But he's lonely in a new city and over-worked, and is starting to get sick of being celibate. Or at least that's what he tells himself is the reason he starts messing around with his ostensibly 'straight' IT guy. Tom's hot, charming, and fun to be around, but can't seem to make up his mind what he's doing with both a female fiancee and a gay playmate. Will's usually so very discerning, and too intelligent and savvy to run through such an emotional and mental minefield. So if he's so damn smart, why can't he stop?",
