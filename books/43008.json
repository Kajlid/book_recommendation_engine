  "title": "The Essence of Life and Love in Australia",
  "description": "This is my third volume of romantic Australian Short Stories. Like the others, it's highly readable, and has been edited by my husband Ronald Sharp B.E.M., the creator of the Grand Organ in the Concert Hall of the Sydney Opera House.The average length of each tale is only four pages, making them ideal for reading on the run. They are engaging, since they portray a variety of emotional situations at various stages of human existence. For example, 'My Daughter Sally' recounts a tale of a young woman's reality check as she sets her sights on a young man of impossibly high social standing, as told through the eyes of her father.'At Seventeen' tells the story of a young girl's infatuation with an older man, unsuspected by him.This book has been read and praised by adults of widely varying ages and backgrounds.",
