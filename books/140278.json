  "description": "Imagine what your life would be like if you could defeat today the problems that defeated you yesterday. Are you tired of living with stress? Do you wish you could undo the mistakes of your past? Do you believe it is impossible to get over a devastating loss? Do you love Jesus but hate the spiritual deadness you feel? Are you always giving in to temptation? Are you paralyzed by fear? Do you want answers to your problems five minutes ago, but your impatience makes you think yesterday would be even better. Have you been told that God won’t put more on you than you can handle, but you can’t handle what you are going through. In The Overcomer, James Collins gives biblical insights to climbing the mountains life puts on your path. Get your copy today and get on the path to overcoming.* Literary Titan Silver Book Award (2024)",
