  "description": "The second book in the Dangerous Angels series is an urban fairytale to touch your soul. It isn't about slinkster dogs, strawberry sundaes, or sleeping on the beach. It's Witch Baby's story; and Witch Baby is different. So maybe it's a book about not belonging. About being outside, looking in.",
