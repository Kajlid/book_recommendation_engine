  "description": "You have a twin in America, somewhere in that western land. Find her if you can. Those are the astounding words of her mother's final letter and all twenty-year-old Sky Hoffman has left in the world. So she sets out on a journey across an ocean in search of answers. She arrives in America broke, homeless, and trying to escape the unwanted attentions of an Englishman intent on pursuing her. Her only option is to sign a contract to marry a man she's never met and join up with a wagon train of mail-order brides headed to the north woods of Minnesota. But with Indian raids, a sneaky detective hired to find her and bring her home, and the rigorous schedule of life on the trail, will Sky even make it to her destination? Can she find her family? And who is Russ Newly, the mysterious, handsome man who appears one night from the shadows? Sky's Bridal Train is the first book in A Newly Weds Series, which takes place in the late 1800s. Jump on the wagon and explore new territories with Sky, Randi, and the other women aboard the train as they search for love and faith.",
