  "title": "The Leafy Man of My Dreams",
  "description": "Cochran is a flora appreciator who purchases a peculiar plant on his nineteenth birthday, and he names it Herby. Little does the poor virgin know that Herby could shift into the leafy man of his (wet) dreams, and with a green monster down below that’s ready for a wild test drive. Too bad Herby doesn’t speak English. Fortunately, he speaks body language, and quite well from what Cochran is about to discover.",
