  "description": "A month ago, Jackie was attending high school and applying for colleges. She lived with her adopted parents and rarely went on a date. A month ago, Jackie thought she was human and didn't believe in the supernatural.So when she woke up on an island and was told that she was a shapeshifter and that her narrow world view needed to broaden to include vampires, werewolves, the fae and many other magical creatures, she just took it all in stride. Well....not so much, really. In fact she was pretty pissed off at first.But after being teamed up with three other young rogue shifters and after meeting Garrett, her extremely hot vampire trainer , Jackie found a peace within herself that she didn't think possible. Now Garrett was her lifemate and her team was ready to protect the magical community from those who don't live by the laws that protected them all.Unfortunately, because of her unusually strong magical abilities, Jackie has caught the interest of a Fae Lord, a creature made of the incredibly potent magic that flows through the earth: so powerful that he's able to make things happen with just a thought. Because they've been invited to the Solstice Ceremony, she and Garrett are on their way into Faerie, into his territory and into more danger than they can possibly imagine.",
