But nobody is as distracting as Elliot Miles…and he knows it.My favorite hobby is infuriating Elliot Miles. Just the sight of my boss’s handsome face triggers my sarcasm. God knows how he earns his Casanova reputation—if a million women want him with his personality, what the heck am I doing wrong?Disgusted with my love life, I join a dating app under a fake name. I start chatting to a man named Edgar. He’s not my type and lives on the other side of the world, but we hit off a friendship, laugh and confide in each other.But lately things are getting weird at work. Elliot’s being…attentive. His eyes linger a little longer than they should, and there’s a heat behind them that I haven’t felt before. And then, in the shock of all shocks, he tells me that my vulnerability is appealing. But when was I vulnerable?Horror dawns…Has my boss been reading my emails to Edgar?Damn it, why did I use my work email?Oh no, does he know what I really think of him? I’d rather die than ever admit it.Or, even worse: is it possible that the man I loathe in real life is the man I’m falling for online?",
