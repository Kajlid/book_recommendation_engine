Tang ’s skipper on all five of her war patrols, Rear Admiral Richard H. O’Kane is acknowledged as the top submarine skipper of World War II. His personal decorations include three Navy Crosses and the Congressional Medal of Honor. He retired as a rear admiral from his command of the Submarine School, rounding out twenty years with the boats. He also wrote the classic The Patrols of America’s Most Famous WWII Submarine.Praise for Clear the Bridge!“There is no doubt that  Tang  was the best. . . . Most of the rest of us wondered what it was she had that the others didn’t. And here it is, in this extraordinary ‘tell it as it really happened’ book, written by the most daring, most professional submarine skipper of the war.” —Capt. Edward Beach, author of  Run Silent, Run Deep “A classic of naval literature. . . . A stirring tribute, not only to [Richard O’Kane’s] gallant crew, but to all World War II submariners.” —Michael D. Hull,  Military Magazine “Reading of [ Tang’ s] career and of the men aboard her is one of the great reading experiences of my life.” —Broox Sledge,  The Book World",
