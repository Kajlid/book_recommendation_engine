  "description": "Librarian's note: This is an alternate copy edition of ISBN 0-06-447110-1.I have added this manually to reflect the different covers despite the fact that the publisher has recently used the same ISBN for a newer version. This is only a temporary solution so that this cover can be listed accurately without tampering with the current version of the book which most people have. Hopefully, someday Goodreads will make it possible to add different cover art for 1 book...until then, hope this entry helps!Book Summary: The many readers who discovered C.S. Lewis's Chronicles through 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' will be delighted to find that the next volume in the series is actually the first in the sequenceâ€”and a step back in time. In this unforgettable story, British schoolchildren Polly and Digory inadvertently tumble into the Wood Between the Worlds, where they meet the evil Queen Jadis and, ultimately, the great, mysterious King Aslan. We witness the birth of Narnia and discover the legendary source of all the adventures that are to follow in the seven books that comprise the series.",
