After Katherine and Delany narrowly escape from a disaster of terrifying proportions, she must quickly learn how to survive in the dark and dangerous world of international conspiracy and terrorism. From the blood-smeared decks of the Majestic to the achingly beautiful--and dangerous--countryside of Italy, to the streets of New York City, Katherine finds herself in a desperate race against a ruthless hit man. And, unless she and Delany can unmask the sinister cabal behind the killing, she will certainly become his next victim.Majestic Descending delivers suspense, captivating characters, romance, and humor--it will haunt you long after you've turned the last page.",
