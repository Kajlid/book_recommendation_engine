Their shared world burns with poetry and music, cigarettes and conversation - hints of the people they hope to become.But Anna, on the cusp of adulthood, is afraid to give up everything she's ever believed in, and everyone she's ever loved. She walks away, and Nick doesn't stop her.Years later, a tragedy draws Anna back into Nick's life.",
