With a blade in his hands, he stole, he battled, he defended and he destroyed. He came with burning fire in his eyes, and a hard rage in his teeth, his thick boots eating miles of the earth. And truly, he never wore sandals, for those were for people who liked having their toes stompedâ€¦\"A tale of adventure, sorcery, swordplay and gold. Also, figs.",
