  "description": "Set in the early 1980's, Robert Gl端ck's first novel, Jack the Modernist, has become a classic of postmodern gay fiction. Bob is excited and lonely. He meets and pursues the elusive Jack, a director who is able to transform others without altering himself. Bob goes to the baths, gossips on the phone, goes to a bar, thinks about werewolves, has an orgasm, and discovers a number of truths about Jack. A paean to love and obsession, Gl端ck's novel explores the everyday in a language that is both intimate and lush. \"Robert Gl端ck has found a new way of making fiction passionate. This novel is a strange, exhilarating love story rich with invention and observation.\" -Edmund White",
