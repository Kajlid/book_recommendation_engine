  "description": "\"What happens when knowing about a secret makes you a part of that secret?I was your average university student, looking forwards to the new term while starting work at my new bar job. Then everything changed. I was kidnapped by a man with impossible abilities, but that was nothing compared to what he showed me. There is another world hidden within and tangential to our own, one I that I was forced to live within. It is a world of strange powers, where emotions are as real as stone and we are granted strange, unpredictable abilities, but it is also a place of insanity, a gathering place of deadly conspiracies and dangerous choices. Knowing about it changes you, makes you into something not more than human, but different, and those changes are dangerous. Worst of all are the people who live there, divided and driven by the power they are gifted with.We call ourselves Awakened, for we have had our eyes opened to the true world around us. Yet, we cannot Awaken everyone, for it would unleash a torrent of insanity that could tear both worlds apart. We have to keep this secret, but there are those who would endanger it, risk the world for a chance at making a fast buck or a touch of power.My name is Aleah, Lea to my friends, and this isn't the life I wanted, but it's the life I've got and I'm going to live it. No matter what comes, whether it's dodgy churches, mad martial artists or power-hungry fools, I'm going to do my best to survive, to thrive and to make something of this new life I have. Regardless of what happens.\"",
