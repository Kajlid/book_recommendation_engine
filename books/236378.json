  "description": "After dropping off a pair of Denali Pack wolves Dustin sees an overturned truck in the wilderness with an injured human desperate for rescue. What he finds when he lands is a trap. Shot and running for his life, Dustin’s wolf instinct takes over and heads him toward a shimmering oasis straight out of a fantasy novel.  Gwylla is on loan from Aerie to the elves, but now that they’ve migrated from Hel, they’re using her magic in ways she never intended. When a gravely injured wolf cries for help at the heart-tree of her sanctuary, she sees firsthand the horrors her magic has caused.  Instead of healing an injured animal, Gwylla finds she has saved a man and is now promise-bound to keep him safe for the rest of his natural life—which means she must punish those responsible for the attack and reclaim her magic, all while protecting her reckless wolf-man as he avenges shifter deaths and defends his pack.",
