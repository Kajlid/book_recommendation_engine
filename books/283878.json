  "description": "A coven of queer witches at an elite women's college employ their powers to exact revenge on the frat boy warlocks who are using magic to cover up sexual assault on campus.When Lee, a first-year college student, is sexually assaulted by a frat boy on a neighbouring campus, she's quickly disillusioned by the lack of recourse. Lost, she turns to her Gender Studies professor who, in turn, recruits her to form a coven with three classmates.Suddenly in possession of very real magic, Lee and her coven set out to use their powers to hex the men who are committing, and covering up, sexual assault. However, their exploits rapidly escalate into vigilante justice and Lee's thirst for revenge on her rapist causes things to spiral out of control, pitting witch against witch and begging the question: how far should you go in order to heal?",
