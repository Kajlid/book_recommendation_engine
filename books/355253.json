  "description": "Book one in the Code of Honour Series A Naval pilot, a one night stand and years later a second chance, can they make it work this time? Pharmacological student, Ayanna Barker, was working hard to give her and her son a good life. Sure, things were tight, but it was all worth it. The man who had given her her child has also given her the best night of her life...and she had never forgotten him. US Navy pilot Lieutenant Michael Taylor loved the rush his job gave him but even that took a back seat to how he felt about the lovely Ayanna Barker, but circumstances keep them apart. Four years later Michael sees her at a different military institution. Ayanna is more beautiful than his vivid memories had recalled her to be, but now she has a child...she has his child. Determined to be a part of her life, and his son's, Michael moves them into his home and marries her. Each day reawakened emotions burn hotter and hotter as they try and keep things under control. But can Michael and Ayanna realise what they share is so much more than just a marriage of convenience?
