  "description": "Imagine a world without color, illuminated by a gray sun.... Imagine a sudden brilliant flash -- an artificial orb ignites, filled with peculiar impossible light. . . . The nature of this light bears no description. It lingers in dreams, inciting an unrequited love for a goddess. A corrupt city is shaped like a perfect wheel, and is ruled by a sister and brother, Regent and Regentrix, by perverse desires, and by a secret. . . . A loyal warrior woman swears to serve a mysterious lord. At the same time, an epic invasion is precipitated by a being of utter darkness, who is the one absolute source of black in a monochrome silver world. And amid all this, flickers an ancient memory of a phenomenon called Rainbow and of those who had once filled the world with an impossible thing called color. . . . Lords of Rainbow.",
