  "description": "How do you define the word used? Some of the synonyms often associated with the word used are accustomed to or habituated. If acting as an adjective, it could mean, not new or second hand. You could be speaking of a used car, used clothing, used furniture, used tissues or maybe even used people. That's how I was feeling. I had become accustomed to being used and had given up on finding real love. I had reached a point in my life that I wasn’t even sure there was such a thing as unconditional love except for that of a love between a parent and their child. I had tried it all; bars, blind dates and online dating sites. The only thing I ever found in a bar was a one night stand. Friends fixed me up with their friends but it never went further than three dates. Online dating sites were full of desperate people and desperation was not a foundation for a long term relationship. Quite frankly, I had gotten tired of feeling used, so I convinced myself there was no such thing as love… … And then I met him.",
