  "description": "Imagine a building, constructed across an invisible chasm of space-time, fated to witness the very end of the world - and waiting with open door for any who dared to enter! This truly unique novel was described thus by no less than H. P. Lovecraft: ~ ~~ ~ \"The wanderings of the narrator's spirit through the limitless light-years of cosmic space and kalpas of eternity, and its witnessing of the solar system's final destruction, constitute something almost unique in standard literature.\" ~ ~~ ~ \"Standard literature\" indeed! This is also a classic twice over. It was written before the First World War (the author was a casualty of that conflict), and lost to print until Ace published this slim volume in 1962.",
