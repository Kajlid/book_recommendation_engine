  "description": "Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Darcy Hughes has her life tightly under control, at least until Ben Dawson moves in next door. Ben’s attempts to be friendly are quickly rebuffed. He calls her out on her rude behavior and suggests that a good spanking will cure her bad attitude. “I’ll give you a spanking.” Darcy opened her mouth to protest. He put a finger to her lips to shush her. “When it’s over, if you still believe that you didn’t need one, then I’ll go back over to my house and I’ll never bother you again.”“But,” he continued to keep his finger on her lips, “if you find that you did need the spanking then I’m going to come back over here every Saturday night and redden your backside.”Note: Although there is sexual content, this book does not include sexual intercourse. This book includes sexual content and consensual spanking between an adult man and woman. If such activities offend you, do not buy this book. For Adults Only.
