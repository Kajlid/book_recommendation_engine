  "description": "What would you do in the dark heat of a dungeon when a man offers his protection in exchange for passion you'd never dreamed possible? When healer Caelan angers her King, she's thrown into prison where she bargains her body to a warrior awaiting execution for a crime he didn't commit. Garron's very name means protector, and he's willing to trade protection to get his hands on a woman who smells like freedom and tastes like passion. But their special powers unite, turning lust into something unforeseen. Soon they are forced to choose between freedom and their growing love in the dark heat of the night.",
