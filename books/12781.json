  "description": "A British nobleman; a prominent lawyer; a renowned physician; and a famed judge of Her Majesty’s court—all marked for murder. But by whom, and why? The only clue is a mysterious green flower, which holds the secret to a diabolical plan of revenge; one whose thorny roots plunge deep into the long buried past. Its mastermind, an exquisite living corpse of a youth, in whose icy veins poison flows. Here is an erotic tale of a supernatural settling of scores, set in the absinthe-tinged hothouse era of late-Victorian decadence. One ripe with intrigue, suspense, and horror, interwoven with forbidden passions and unrequited desires that will stir the blood of any reader.Advance Praise for The Arsenic FlowerIf you’re looking for a darkly captivating read, one that's wholly original yet seems to be channeling the spirits of both Oscar Wilde and Charles Baudelaire, The Arsenic Flower is a bit of truly decadent, wicked fun. It’s macabre, delicious...and compulsively readable...a journey through the darkest regions of the human heart.Rick R.
