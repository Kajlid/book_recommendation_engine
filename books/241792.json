  "description": "The Moomins, in case you haven't already met them, are kind, philosophical creatures with velvety fur and smooth round snouts, who live in a beautiful valley in a forest in Finland. They have the most natural way of turning friends into family - Moominmamma simply adds another plank to the table and Moominpappa builds a new bed. The Moomins sleep through the winter, when the snow turns their house into a giant snowball. But when spring comes they wake and clamber down rope ladders hanging from there windows, ready for a bright new adventure.In Finn Family Moomintroll the discovery of the Hobgoblin's hat leads to the most extraordinary magic and mayhem. Coupled with the arrival of Thingumy and Bob and their mysterious suitcase, the Moomins have never experienced anything quite like this before.",
