  "description": "In 1962, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko gave birth to one of the most-enduring icons in American popular media: the one and only Amazing Spider-Man! Turning the concept of a super hero on its head, they imbued the young, guilt-ridden Peter Parker with the fantastic powers of an arachnid and the fantastic pressures of an everyday teenager. The combination was pure magic during the course of 40 issues of web-slinging, wisecracking wonderment Lee and Ditko built the foundation for 45 years of Spidey spectaculars - girl trouble; bill trouble; bully trouble; the Daily Bugle; and a cast friends, family and, of course, supervillains unlike any other!Collecting: Amazing Fantasy 15; Amazing Spider-Man 1-38, Annual 1-2; Fantastic Four Annual 1; Strange Tales Annual 2",
