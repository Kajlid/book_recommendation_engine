  "title": "Man Hunt",
  "description": "MAN HUNT is the story of the Espinosas, members of a secret brotherhood, who rampage through Southern Colorado and Northern New Mexico robbing and killing Gringos. Tom Tobin is an illiterate hunter, trader, rancher, Indian fighter and sometimes U. S. Army guide. Tobin leads a small detachment of soldiers to hunt the Espinosas, tracks them down, uses his Hawken 54 caliber rifle to kill them at long range then cuts off their heads. He returns to Fort Garland with the grisly trophies but refuses the large reward for killing them. Why were Gringos the only targets of the Espinosas? Why did Tobin agree to hunt his wifeâ€™s cousins? How did the doctrine of Manifest Destiny result in the Mexican-American War and the annexation of what is now New Mexico, Arizona, and much of Colorado and Utah? How did the Americans legally steal huge tracts of land from the New Mexicans? The era of the Mountain Man, the San Luis Valley and events leading to and following the Mexican-American War provide the backdrop for this story of revenge, redemption, repentance and brutality.",
