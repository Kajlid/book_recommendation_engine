  "title": "The Authenticity of the Bible: Assurance that the Bible is the Word of God [Annotated, Updated]",
  "description": "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. – 2 Timothy 3:16Is the Bible the Word of God? That is the most important question for humanity. If the Bible is the Word of God, if it is an absolutely trustworthy revelation from God Himself, of Himself, His purposes, and His will, of man’s duty and destiny, and of spiritual and eternal realities, then we have a starting point from which we can proceed to the conquest of the whole domain of religious truth.This book will show you the absolute trustworthiness of the Bible. Follow the Word of God, and it will lead you as it has led thousands of others. It will lead you out of the uncertainty and the restlessness and the ultimate despair of unbelief and into the certitude, the joy, the victory, and the ultimate glory of an intelligent faith in the Bible as the Word of God, and in Jesus Christ as the Son of God.About the AuthorReuben Archer Torrey traveled all over the world leading evangelistic tours, preaching to the unsaved.
