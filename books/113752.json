  "description": "Edzard Schaper is a great storyteller who, it seems has absorbed the spirit of a whole people. With a sweet love for detail, and never without a smile, he tells the old legend of the fourth king. While most probably told from generation to generation, this charming little story has never been written with such loving imagination and deep spirituality. As it traces the adventures of the Czar who sets off to follow the star and find the king of kings in Bethlehem, this precious book offers a kaleidoscope of human life itself.",
