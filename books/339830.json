But Jackson, landless and without title, must leave the man he has grown to love to find his destiny at his father's castle in Baymore.Will fell in love the moment Jackson cut him down and held him in his arms. Jackson is everything Will had been searching for, a man of honor and strength, with a gentle soul. A true noble man, despite his lack of title. And for Will, titles mean nothing, but love is everything.\nPublisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Anal play/intercourse, male/male sexual practices, strong violence, voyeurism.",
