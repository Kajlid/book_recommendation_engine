  "description": "While Chris and Sara have traveled to Paris to avoid the chaos of press and police after the tragic events in San Francisco, I have stayed to face the reality of what has happened. But there is no peace to be found in facing the truth, and no truth to be found in the confessions that have been made and retracted. I am a Master, all about control, and yet right now, facing great tragedy, I feel as if I have none. I find sanctuary in the one place I've promised I will never be again, but cannot seem to resist. Her arms.This novella should be read between book three (Revealing Us) and book four (No In Between). And after The Master Undone, which also fits between books three and four.",
