  "title": "No Beast So Fierce",
  "description": "An angry and mercilessly suspenseful novel about an ex-con's attempt to negotiate the \"straight world\" and his swan dive back into the paradoxical security of crime. It is airtight in its construction, almost photorealistic in its portrayal of L. A. lowlife and utterly knowledgeable about the terrors of liberty, the high of the quick score and the rage that makes the finger tighten on the trigger of the gun.",
