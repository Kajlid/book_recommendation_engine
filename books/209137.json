  "description": "Some people are just weird. They don't fit in - not at school, not at home, not with other kids no matter how hard they try. In the age of dwarves and dragons, outcasts end up as slaves, thieves, or worse. For the ones lucky enough to live in the land of Iasos, there is an alternative school - a last chance for THE LEFTOVERS of society to find their path before it's assigned for them.",
