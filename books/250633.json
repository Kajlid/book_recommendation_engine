  "description": "Imagine alien AI Observers have infiltrated Earth to evaluate humanity. Imagine the Observers are more human than we are.  Mark Ai goes to work every day as a PC repairman, but fixing computers is just a cover job. Along with his mission managing the observation team, he's attempting to fill in as a parent for a teenage neighbor, provide a good home for a dog, and pick up a little money on the side. It's a juggling act that understandably leads to breaking a few rules, but things really start spinning out of control when competing aliens arrive.",
