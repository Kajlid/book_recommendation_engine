  "description": "An all-new dark romance standalone by author Rachel Leigh with an obsessive anti-hero, and a heroine who fights as hard as she falls.It should have been a harmless swindle.A survival tactic, plain and simple.Because I, Rhea Thorn, am a survivor.At least, I thought I was…Until I conned a psycho.After a meaningless one night stand, I emptied his wallet and fled before the morning sun.By that night, I had seventeen missed calls, and a broken window with a note:You can keep what you stole, but I get you in return.Everywhere I go, he’s there—blurring the vision between right and wrong, while enticing me with his sultry blue eyes.Alaric promised me I’d never forget him.And I’m beginning to fear he’s right.",
