  "description": "Jeremy Jackson is an average man, like most of us, living a life dedicated to his family and work. During what appears to be a routine business trip to Las Vegas, he is involved in a serious traffic accident.Upon regaining consciousness after the accident, Jeremy finds his world in chaos. He is interrogated about events he doesn't remember, actions he has taken but can't comprehend, and finds himself fighting an organization that most people don't know exists. The world he had become so comfortable in has been turned upside down. He has arrived at a crossroads, where a decision must be made—a decision to fight the giant that has taken over his life or to give up, but at what cost?Regardless of the risks, Jeremy realizes it is time to change from being a work in progress to becoming the man destiny is challenging him to be—or to die trying.",
