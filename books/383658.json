  "description": "The Relapse Toolkit is designed for use by counselors and therapists who work in the addictions field and address issues of relapse and relapse management. It can be used effectively within a group orientation or with an individual participant. This Toolkit contains 38 modules, each with pertinent didactic, reproducible handouts, and a \"paint-by-the-numbers\" format. There are several sessions that include the opportunity for a guided imagery. All imageries are included on a compact disc that comes with the book. Session titles include Overconfidence, Control, Feelings, Relationships, Multi-addictions, Secrets, plus many more to choose from and create a format for your specific needs. Sessions can be condensed or expanded by use of opening and closing rituals, time offered to complete exercises, and depth of discussion. Sessions can be used in the order presented or simply pick and choose those that are most relevant to the participants. The author encourages the user to be creative, know the needs of the participants, and bring their own style of work into the process.",
