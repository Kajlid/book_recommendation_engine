  "description": "Scattered across a continent, three dragon siblings are among the last of a dying breedâ€”the final hope for their species' survival. After fighting a war that cost each of them kingdom and land, friends and family, honor and glory, the dragon siblings have removed themselves from the troubles of the world. But the order they fought to establish is falling apart. Ancient sorceries have been awakened. Dragons battle dragons. And men are taking up arms against their winged overlords. Now, the three must unite once more to save dragonkind from extinction, before the chaos and fire of war consume them all...and the world with them.",
