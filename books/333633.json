  "description": "Applying psychology to criminal cases contains itself a sense of justice for the person or victim, and to society, because it bestows a feeling of being precisely a person, a human being, a valuable being within our group, both when they suffer injustice and, is also definite teaching for the criminal who is often very used to dominate others' perceptions to walk away unpunished, or to those who have lost the sense of reality not finding the proper ways to a positive existence.This document details the rationale for the application of psychology to the new rising field in Mexico, Criminal Psychology. Every kind of case is a chapter and details the rationale, the procedure, the resources used, and also the results achieved.The objective in selecting the method and the procedure to solve the set-points that were assigned by the Court in each case was, that any psychologist would be able to apply the same instruments that I was using, based on most recent theories and others to be created, to achieve the same results. In this way, the expert psychologist can aim to be an auxiliary in the administration of justice.",
