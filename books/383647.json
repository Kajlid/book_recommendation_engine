  "description": "Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Larry McMurtry rediscovered the myth of the Old West and gave it new life in books such as LONESOME DOVE and ANYTHING FOR BILLY. McMurtry once again looks to the Old West and brings to life the legendary Calamity Jane in BUFFALO GIRLS. Calamity Jane is the West -- a larger than life figure, living in her friend Dora's cathouse in Miles City. Grown old and reclusive, she is content remembering the excitement of her past and relating it in letters to her daughter -- until old friend Buffalo Bill Cody and his Wild West Show come to town. Buffalo Bill makes Calamity an offer that she can't refuse -- a chance to relive her glory days. \"Calamity Jane is as real and as moving a heroine as Larry McMurtry has ever created.\" (Publisher's Source)",
