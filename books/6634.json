Once a darling of New Orleans society, Nicci pens a novel about her departed love, the artist David Alexander. While promoting her book in the Big Apple, she's approached by David's former boss, Simon La Roy, who has a theory about David's death that devastates Nicci. She learns David's murder may be linked to someone from her past. Enter Dallas August, an elite member of Simon's organization of corporate spies prized for his ruthless ability to get the job done.
