  "title": "The Toothpaste of Immortality: Self-Construction in the Consumer Age",
  "description": "This lively and insightful account reveals the profound ways in which everyday acts and artifacts of consumer civilization shape our sense of self. Elemér Hankiss shows how human beings act simultaneously in two plays. On the \"trivial\" surface of their everyday lives they work, make money, raise children, build houses, and do a lot of other things. At the same time, they also act in the \"existential\" drama of their lives―even if they are not aware of doing so. They construct and reconstruct their selves each day by striving for authenticity, the intense experience of being, dignity, meaning, and the hope of immortality. Hankiss explores this interaction between the trivial and existential, in the process unfolding its context in \"consumer civilization.\" This concept is brilliantly illustrated in a section entitled \"the toothpaste of immortality\": \"If we watch enough commercials, we believe that this or that special brand of toothpaste preserves our teeth, and― per metonymiam ―ourselves, young and beautiful indefinitely. And then, for a fleeting moment, there, in our bathrooms, we experience the sweet and melancholy illusion that we may stay young and beautiful forever; that we may defeat mortality; we may defeat decay and death.\" First published to great success in Hungarian, this entertaining and compelling book reveals surprising insights into the challenges and possibilities of self-fulfillment.",
