  "description": "There's something different about Jackson. There always was, but when the savant six year old begins to suffer trances, both his parents are filled with worry. Helplessly they watch the episodes, which begin with their son going stiff as a board, unresponsive, and staring into space. Their frustration grows as doctors are unable to explain the catalepsy. His mother Clarice may know the answer, but she’s keeping it to herself. She has no desire to confront her own past, which she hides even from her husband, for she fears Jackson may be haunted by her demons. Clarice may not be the only one who can explain Jackson’s condition. His nanny, Mrs. Nicestrum has been with the Millers since the day he was born. Usually over-protective, Nicey is oddly unconcerned over his spells. When John Miller's Construction business expands, the tiny family relocates to a remote area outside Ithaca NY, where Clarice discovers THE GLEN, a sylvan paradise, whose borders call to her spirit and touch every extrasensory nerve she ever denied. At the same time, Jackson becomes the target of bizarre attempts on his life. With no idea destiny has drawn them there and completely unaware of the satanic cult plotting to kill their son, John and Clarice must learn the purpose of THE GLEN in order to save him. But will discovering the reason their son needs THE GLEN prove as perilous as delivering him to it? Both a mystery to unravel and a paranormal thriller to excite, THE GLEN reads like a photographic negative of THE OMEN with biblical clues that foreshadow an apocalyptic mystery. THE GLEN is a classic tale of good versus evil and the first in The Glen Series by Carla Coon.",
