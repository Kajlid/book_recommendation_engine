  "description": "With The Rise of Nazil and the defeat of the Vereuxs, the lands of Fa√©londul were freed. Pentanimir Benoist now stands as Zaxson--the most powerful man in the lands. The love he held for Brahanu was the catalyst for Nazil's liberation. Will that same love also lead to its destruction?In Seed of Scorn, the much awaited sequel to The Rise of Nazil, Pentanimir and the entire House of Benoist face an insidious threat--a threat that assails them on all fronts, yet remains largely invisible. Both Nikolina d'Garrion once pledged to Danimore Benoist and Molag Bomgaard--unwittingly manipulated by an ancient evil-- threaten the peace of the lands and the lives of the Benoists. With the release of a Zon'tul and an indissoluble pact, the pall of darkness manifests. A darkness the Guardians could not foresee nor deter. Will the warriors align with those of Nazil or allow the darkness to consume them?Seed of Scorn takes the epic saga to previously unheard of levels of complexity and intrigue. It is an enthralling tale of love, honor, betrayal, and the perfidious depths people will descend for the sake of revenge. Aaron-Michael Hall's craftwork--the unforgettable characters, the surprising twists, and turns, the intricate, rich plotting--will dazzle you. If you loved The Rise of Nazil, prepare to be blown away! Seed of Scorn will grip you from the beginning and leave you in awe.DUE TO SOME GRAPHIC SCENES AND ADULT SITUATIONS, THIS BOOK IS INTENDED FOR MATURE READERS ONLY",
