  "title": "At Home in the World: Stories and Essential Teachings from a Monk's Life",
  "description": "This collection of 81 dharma stories illustrate Thich Nhat Hanh’s essential teachings on mindfulness, peace, and social engagement.  Collected here for the first time, these personal, autobiographical stories from peace activist and Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh perfectly illustrate his most essential teachings. The beauty of these simple lessons is that readers do not need to be versed in meditation or Buddhist practices to find peace, sanctuary, and sustenance here.   Told with his signature clarity and humor, these stories are drawn from the long span of Thich Nhat Hanh's life, from his childhood in rural Vietnam to his years as a teenaged novice, and as a young teacher and writer in his war-torn home country. Readers will also join Nhat Hanh on his later travels around the world teaching mindfulness, making pilgrimages to sacred sites, and meeting with world leaders. This inspiring read follows in the tradition of Zen teaching stories—dharma—that goes back at least to the time of the Buddha. Thich Nhat Hanh uses storytelling to share important teachings, insights, and life lessons. Despite his passing in 2022, hunger for his writing continues to widen and deepen as the benefits of mindfulness continue to seep into the global zeitgeist.",
