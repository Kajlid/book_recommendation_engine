  "description": "\"Lesley Bannatyne's fascinating book . . . will be widely appealing to anyone who ever wondered where witches, trick-or-treating, and jack-o-lanterns really came from. It is by far the best book on the history of Halloween available today.\"--Alison Guss, senior producer,\"The Haunted History of Halloween,\" The History Channel \"An excellent resource for research into the history of holidays . . . in the United States. . . Highly Recommended.\"--The Book Report \"Deserves attention as a recommended library acquisition with years of 'life' to its information.\"--The Midwest Book Review \"Overflows with rich and provocative details of ritual, feasts, superstition, and devilment.\"--North Carolina Historical Review Halloween has evolved from the Celtic celebrations of 2,000 years ago to become today the fastest-growing holiday in the country. This, the only book to completely cover All Hallow's Eve, from its beginnings to the present, examines the ancient origins as well as its traditions and celebrations, from costuming to bobbing for apples. Jack-o-lanterns, black cats, and witches are explained. Ghosts, ghouls, and goblins lurk behind every page. The book traces the contributions of America's immigrants to the holiday, documenting the beliefs each ethnic group has added to the mix. Related recipes, poems, songs, and photos perfectly complement the meticulously documented text. The result is the most educational and entertaining examination of Halloween, its myths, and its truths.",
