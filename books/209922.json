  "description": "Los Angeles, 2012. It’s been five years since the events of The Mortal Instruments, when the Nephilim stood poised on the brink of oblivion and Shadowhunter Emma Carstairs lost her parents. After the blood and violence she witnessed as a child, Emma has dedicated her life to eradicating demons and becoming the best, fastest, and deadliest Shadowhunter since Jace Lightwood.Raised in the Los Angeles Institute, Emma is paired as a parabatai with her best friend, Julian. As Emma hunts those responsible for her parents' deaths, the trail they’re following leads back to those they’ve always been taught to trust. At the same time, Emma finds herself falling in love with Julian—her closest friend and, because he is her parabatai, the one person in the world she is absolutely forbidden by Shadowhunter Law to love.Set against the glittering backdrop of present-day Los Angeles, Emma must learn to trust both her head and her heart as she investigates a demonic plot that stretches from the warlock-run nightclubs of the Sunset Strip to the enchanted sea that pounds the beaches of Santa Monica.",
