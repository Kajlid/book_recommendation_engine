  "title": "Tail Feathers from Mother Goose: The Opie Rhyme Book",
  "description": "Illustrated by many of the world's most distinguished children's book artists, 'Tail Feathers from Mother Goose' is a treasure of incalculable value.Filled with joyful rhythms, strange words, and mysterious happenings, the rhymes in this book have been chosen by Iona Opie, from the Opie Collection of Children's Literature, that astonishing compilation of folklore and literature gathered over forty years and housed at Oxford University. The rhymes included here are almost all previously unpublished and they include unusual versions of known nursery rhymes, versions used by the Opies themselves or rhymes sent to them by people who wanted them saved and recorded.In this remarkable book, lighthearted verses are followed by magical, mystifying or romantic ones. The charming diversity of these rhymes is matched only by the inventiveness of the artists, who have illustrated them superbly. Here, then, is a book that families will read together, incorporate into their common experience, and, above all, cherish.",
