Melanie Thorpe believes that love and marriage are fine for other people—people who don’t have the kind of baggage to carry around that she does. Over the years, she has done what was necessary to protect herself, and she never takes anyone at face value. Her choices make it difficult to let anyone get close but she has a handful of people she counts as good friends. As she watches some of those friends fall in love and get married, Melanie finds herself wondering if it might be worth taking a chance. Is there a way to have a relationship without ever revealing the past that has shaped the way she lives her life now? Tyler Harris has been married before, but when his wife divorced him after an explosion left him with a double amputation below the knee, he wasn’t all too keen to rush into another relationship. Six years later, his life is full with his involvement at his church, his job and his large group of friends. He’s been happy with the many friendships he has—including one with Melanie Thorpe—but when he begins to feel more for her, Tyler wonders if it’s worth risking a friendship for the possibility of love. If Melanie was able to trust a man, it would be someone like Tyler. She has long admired him, but lately—with love blossoming all around her—she’s starting to feel things for him she never thought she’d feel for any man. But can she trust him enough to share about her past?  When a tragic event brings secrets to light, Tyler struggles to understand Melanie’s trust issues even as he tries to encourage her to not only trust him but God as well. Will she take a chance on Tyler? Or will her determination to keep herself safe send him away? Stayed tuned for the next Christian romance book in the BlackThorpe Security series early 2016.
