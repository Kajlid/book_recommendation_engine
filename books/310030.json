  "description": "Bella ChortskySo, my Chihuahua humped a bear. Excuse me, a giant, bear-like dog.Now the bear’s scorching hot owner is on my case, demanding an STD test... for my pet.Another problem with this dog-on-dog molestation? The bear’s mysterious owner may be the key to funding my new venture and taking my toys company to the next level. And by “toys,” I mean the fun kind, the kind every woman (and man) needs.If only I could figure out what he’s hiding—or get my libido to behave. Because mixing business and pleasure is a bad idea, and Dragomir Lamian may not be who he seems.NOTE: This is a standalone, raunchy, slow-burn romantic comedy featuring a confident, toy-obsessed heroine who knows every Russian superstition under the sun, her meet-cute with a hot, mysterious stranger, and two oversexed dogs, one of which may have a special toy of his own. If any of the above is not your cup of tea, run away now. Otherwise, buckle in for a laugh-out-loud, feel-good ride.",
