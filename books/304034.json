  "description": "Opal LaZelle is a special effects make-up artist, transforming actors into fantastical and grotesque creatures. Unknown to the casts and crews of the films she works on, Opal is gifted in the art of magicÂ—and she applies more than make-up when altering an actorÂ's features.Her latest job requires turning Corvus Weather into a dark god of the forest. But when CorvusÂ's performance becomes too convincingÂ—on set and offÂ—Opal realizes heÂ's not acting. Something has taken possession of Corvus. Something sinister tied to the townÂ's past, with the ability to absorb the very essence of life. Something Opal doesnÂ't have enough power to confront, much less drive from the man she has fallen in love with.",
