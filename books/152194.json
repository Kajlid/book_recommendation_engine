  "description": "As they recover from the loss of their leader, Austin and Ellie will have to fight to save the love they can’t afford to lose.  Everything has changed for the Iron Raiders. After the mission to save Ellie from the Black Brothers, which resulted in the death of their president and the only father Ellie had ever known, everyone is left in shock. With new leadership and a fight still on their hands, it will take every brother to save their club and get the vengeance they are determined to have.  For Austin, almost losing Ellie was like a hard jab to the gut, and it’s made him realize that he’ll do anything to keep her. But Ellie isn’t so sure. She’s taking the loss of the man who raised her hard, and it’s made her doubt the love that Austin claims to have for her, pushing him away to avoid suffering any more pain.  As Austin steps up to keep the club from falling apart, he will also have to fight to keep the woman who’s once again determined to hold him at arms’ length. But when the Raiders’ plan to destroy the Black Brothers once and for all runs into some problems, it just might be what Ellie needs to realize the depth of her emotion for Austin.  She can only hope that it won’t be too late, for the sake of the club, and the man she’s fallen in love with.",
