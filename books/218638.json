  "title": "The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society",
  "description": "\"A novel set in letters from Nazi-occupied Guernsey.\"It is 1946, in the thick of World War II, when American writer Juliet Ashton becomes the sudden recipient of letters from the inhabitants of Guernsey, the small island in the English Channel that has fallen under Nazi control. The letter writers have formed the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society as a way to gather without attracting the attention of their occupiers. Out of these letters, Juliet comes to know the lives, loves, and hardships of a wonderfully eccentric and vivid cast of characters, and their charming philosophies and anecdotes help her resolve her own romantic conundrum. This warm, inspiring novel originated in the true life stories of Mary Ann Fiery Shaffer, who, upon learning of her terminal illness, contacted her niece Annie Barrows to help her finish the novel. Though Shaffer died in 2008, the year of the novel's publication, her memories of the hardships of war and the resilience of the people of Guernsey live on in this delightful book.",
