  "description": "An endless, broiling summer bakes the deaders that roam the world. Veronica feels stuck in limbo while she waits for news that might bring an end to the nightmare that has overtaken their world. Between bashing heads and scavenging for what's left, it's all she can do to keep on going. Back at the warehouse complex, the rest of the group keeps watch over their group of captive in-betweeners and tries to stay alive. At long last, Veronica finds a package left by Princeton and Violet at their drop-off point. Everything is finally going their way and a cure for the in-betweeners might finally be within their grasp. But nothing is easy in the post-nanite world of deaders and in-betweeners. Not everyone wants a cure for the nanite plague. Around every shiny, white cloud is a deep, black lining. This time, the clouds are smoke and there is a storm coming.",
