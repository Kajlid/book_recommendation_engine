  "title": "Growing Up Cowboy: Confessions of a Luna Kid",
  "description": "Coming of age in the rugged and unforgiving Southwest may not suit the faint-of-heart, but it is the perfect landscape for a compelling and humorous memoir of a lad who endured a mid-1900s cowboy upbringing in rural Arizona and New Mexico. Growing Up Cowboy chronicles the foibles and fortunes of its author, Ralph Reynolds (a.k.a. Luna Kid), in an engaging and heartfelt fashion. From wrangling ornery critters to finding first love, the Luna Kid confesses all and regales the reader with vivid stories imparted with an abundance of wit and humility. So saddle up and ride along as the Luna Kid introduces you to a helping of the Southwest's fascinating terrain and colorful characters. And along the way shows you the irreverent side of adolescence adventure and the human side of growing up cowboy. Growing Up Cowboy can be found on the shelves of the National Cowboy Museum Library, and selections from the book have been reprinted by the National Cowboy Hall of Fame.",
