  "title": "You Are Going To Die",
  "description": "Who knew there were so many angles to the topic of death? People live, someday they'll die, seems pretty cut and dry. But no, there's a myriad considerations of when and how death comes, whether it's after 90 years of breathing, or during the throes of youth. An accident may take a life, while others are murdered, and some commit suicide. War and fatal diagnoses are precursors of death. No matter how it comes it will arrive, yet countless human beings are terrorized by that inevitability and resist it with every breath. This book is an attempt to reduce that fear—and increase a zest for life—with compassion, common sense, and even humor. Yes, humor. What better way to face the grim reaper than by having the last laugh?",
