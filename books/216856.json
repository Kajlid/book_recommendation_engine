  "description": "Acting Up: More Adventures of a Hollywood Dog Walker is the third book in a series of new adult romantic comedies set in Tinseltown. Twenty-one-year-old Tessa Taylor has so much going for her: a loving relationship with Ryan, a burgeoning acting career, a profitable dog-walking business, and a fantastic group of friends. So why isn’t she happy? For starters, she’s been flopping at auditions, and Ryan isn’t as supportive of her acting career as she’d like him to be. When Tessa meets sexy, wild-boy rocker Ash Adams, she can’t stop thinking about him, but is he the man she really needs? Meanwhile, her dog-walking business leads her to danger. She ends up playing a key part in breaking up a ruthless dognapping ring, culminating in a late-night mission to an abandoned asylum and a dramatic shootout in the LA River. With all these problems, can Tessa overcome the odds and find the happiness she yearns for? One thing’s for sure: the constants in her life are fabulous friends and delightful dogs and the sidesplitting—and sometimes perilous—adventures they share.",
