  "description": "This wonderful Ramona Box Set, by Beverly Cleary, contains four books: Henry Huggins, Henry and Ribsy, Henry and Beezus, and Henry and the Clubhouse.Henry HugginsHenry Huggins had been wishing for some excitement in his life -- but not this kind. There's no way he wants to stand on the school stage in his pajamas -- and be kissed by an eighth-grade girl! Henry soon finds out that this is only the beginning of his exciting new life.Henry and RibsyHenry Huggins is trying his hardest to keep Ribsy out of trouble for a wholemonth. But Ribsy doesn't make it easy for Henry. What can one boy do with a dog who steals a policeman's lunch and an ice cream cone from Ramona Quimby?Henry and BeezusAll Henry Huggins can think about is owning a bicycle, especially since that big show-off Scooter McCarthy has one. Selling bubble gum to all the kids at school brings Henry plenty of trouble but very little money for his bike fund. Can a girl really help Henry earn the money for a bicycle? Henry's friend Beezus helps him turn the most humiliating situation of his life into a real business success.Henry and the ClubhouseHenry Huggins has a lot of good ideas when he first begins his paper route, especially the idea to build a clubhouse. Henry and his friends don't want any girls hanging out at their new clubhouse. But a silly old sign that says NO GIRLS ALLOWED can't stop Beezus and Ramona Quimby.",
