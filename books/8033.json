  "description": "Dylan Mahoney is living one big unholy lie. Thanks to a humiliating and painfully public sexting incident, Dylan has become the social pariah at her suburban Chicago high school. She’s ignored by everyone―when she’s not being taunted―and estranged from her two best friends. So when Dylan discovers the blogs of homeschooled fundamentalist Christian girls, she’s immediately drawn into their fascinating world of hope chests, chaperoned courtships, and wifely submission. Blogging as Faith, her devout and wholesome alter ego, Dylan befriends Abigail, the online group’s queen bee. After staying with Abigail and her family for a few days, Dylan begins to grow closer to Abigail (and her intriguingly complicated older brother). Soon, Dylan is forced to keep living a lie . . . or come clean and face the consequences. A Junior Library Guild Selection \"Josie Bloss writes about obsession―characters who are obsessed with band or music, obsessed with a boy, obsessed with someone else's life. They're themes to which all young adults―popular or not―can relate.\"―INDIANAPOLIS STAR",
