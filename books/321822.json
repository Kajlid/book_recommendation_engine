Kennedy has invited luck-worker Aiden Connolly and his younger brother, Rian. She’s also invited Venus, an immortal once worshipped as the goddess of love.Venus earned her reputation honestly. There’s nothing she likes more than matchmaking, and the three Bennett sisters are ripe for her particular skills.The trick to getting Kennedy and Aiden together is to give them a mystery to solve. Just grab a local cold case and add a few red herrings. They’ll be so happy working together again that they’ll never know the difference. Or that’s the theory. But when the mystery turns into a real one, Venus’s plan may end up doing more harm than good.",
