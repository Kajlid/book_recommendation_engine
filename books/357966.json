  "description": "<!--StartFragment--> Seducing virgins, preying upon hapless travelers, luring mortals toward madness and death . . . What are faeries really like? Contrary to today’s sanitized depictions, the hobgoblins, imps, sprites, elves, and other magical creatures embodied in folklore can be quite nasty. Kenny Klein draws on folkloric record—ancient songs, stories of forest and field, legends, myths, and sagas—to reveal faeries’ true where they live; what they do; their desires, fears, powers, proclivities, and enchantments. Entertaining and enlightening, this unique guide explores human interactions with Mab the Faerie Queen, Puck the prankster, Reynardine the fox man, Jenny Green Teeth, and an array of other legendary fey. It includes rituals and spells for faerie protection, tells the reader how to enlist faerie help in finding lost objects or gaining inspiration, and offers practical tips for those who dare to venture into the world of the Faerie. “Think you know faeries? This well-researched, compelling book will have you looking twice at shadows and tying bits of red thread around your bedposts for protection.” —Jennifer McMahon, author of Promise Not to Tell <!--EndFragment-->",
