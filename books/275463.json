  "description": "Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles.'Be sure you don't answer the door to anyone you don't know.'A little Patricia Highsmith, a touch of Shirley the long-neglected Celia Fremlin wrote short, sharp stories that threw women's lives into shiver-inducing relief.In each of these twinned tales, a mother and daughter meet again, and an ordinary home becomes the setting for a return of the repressed.Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.",
