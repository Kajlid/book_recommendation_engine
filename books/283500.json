  "title": "The Dead",
  "description": "The Judge came like a thief in the night. No one knew that the world had ended---until the sun began to rot in the sky, and the graves opened, and angels from Hell clothed themselves in the flesh of corpses...Long out of print, this murderous theological fantasy presents an epic vision of damnation and redemption, supercharged with mayhem, terror, and old-time religion. Looking for a good scare? Try The Dead, and bite off more than you can chew.",
