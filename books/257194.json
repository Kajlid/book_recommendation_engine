  "description": "Malcolm's a man in his mid-thirties, very tall and quite handsome too. He's also a successful manager of a restaurant, has money in the bank and is a bachelor looking for true love. Would he still be an eligible bachelor though, if he was still a virgin? Would he still be desired, if he wore spectacles and was a little bit of a geek? Truth is, Malcolm is a wonderful man, but he seriously lacks confidence. He's been in love with the same woman for three years, yet she doesn't even know it and people would rather bully him, than offer him a real friendship. Malcolm leads a very dull and routine driven life. However, that's about to change with the introduction of Dexter, a South Londoner, with enough swagger, nerve and craziness for the both of them.An adult comedy about one man's desire to be someone, followed by his dream to become a nobody yet again.",
