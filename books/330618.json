  "description": "The University of Allemonde decides to sponsor an airshow for dirigibles at the same time as the duchy’s annual opera festival. The composer celebrated this year is Gioachino Rossini and, when a performer is killed onstage, the future of both the airshow and the opera festival are suddenly placed in doubt. Missing paintings, stolen identities, and a cast of the strangest characters this side of Figaro combine to make Chief Inspector D. T. Giovanni’s latest case a mystery on an operatic scale.",
