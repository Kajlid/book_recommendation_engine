Cathy , the character who has given a voice to the anxieties and triumphs of modern women, is a must-read in newspapers worldwide. In this collection, Cathy has broken up with long-time beau Irving.

Cathy has a uniquely funny way of coping with life, and her millions of fans count on Cathy to put their shared experiences in a humorous light.",
