  "description": "I met my soulmate on July 17th, 2017. He wasn’t my typical type, but the way his ice blue eyes cut through me and his deep honeyed voice warmed me back up made him something new entirely; they were two of the million little things that seemed to make him mine. Except…I met my fiancé December 22nd, 2012. I didn’t plan for any of this to happen. Not to meet James Larrabee or to fall in love. Not to hurt the people closest to me. And definitely, definitely not to write the letters that would be both my salvation and my damnation.",
