  "description": "BACON IS BANNED--AND THE GOVERNMENT IS RUNNING HOG-WILD! The Government's Cheap and Accessible Care Act (“CACA”) has put healthcare in the toilet. But President Bodvar Olsen is forging ahead with still more Government controls, from dietary mandates to restrictions on e-mail jokes. Now, as the President jets off to golf outings and TV talk shows, seven unlikely protesters are heading for Mexico. Their goals: 1) to cross the border for quality medical services; and 2) to focus media attention on the Government’s invasive policies. Marvin, a Government health official with secret doubts about his job, is duped into making the journey by his John Wayne-quoting neighbor, who needs a colonoscopy without a two-year delay. Also on the trek are a retired Supreme Court justice; a disgraced lawmaker who yelled \"liar, liar, pants on fire\" during a presidential address; and Marvin's plugged pug, Lex, who needs his own scope job. In hot pursuit, a relentless operative from the White House Office of Truth (\"WHOT\") and his team race to head them off at the pass. Marvin and his companions must elude the WHOT men, armed only with their determination and the prohibited pork they distribute to the bacon-starved citizens they encounter. Along the way, Marvin begins to appreciate that freedom is more than just another word.",
