  "description": "Just hand me a good idea, and I'll set the stage and create the costumes. I'll make it real. Such is the motto of Mason, a big back leatherman with a reputation for intense role-playing. Unfortunately, most of the bottoms in Mason's local leather bar have cliché fantasies. They want him to play the stereotypical role of bad-ass cellmate or gangbanger. Then enters Leo—an older gent who had nothing at all to offer—not youth or good looks, or even stamina. Leo, however, has something Mason hasn't had before—a pulpy fetish decades old and far from the usual. The Fancy Man cannot refuse such a challenge! (Novella - 13000 words.)",
