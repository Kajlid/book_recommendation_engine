His farm is nearly destroyed by blight and he cannot pay the taxes he owes. And he is a husband and father of three whose daughter is secretly in love with a Cossack-one of the very soldiers who persecute families like Vladimir's. Though he may lose everything he loves, Vladimir must trust God as he navigates his river of trouble. When he finally arrives in the \"land of the free and the home of the brave,\" his destiny-and faith-is changed forever.",
