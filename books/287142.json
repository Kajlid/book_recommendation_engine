  "description": "Interculturality has been one of key concepts in phenomenological literature. It seeks to clarify the philosophical basis for intercultural exchange within the horizon of our life-world. The essays in this volume focus on the themes around space, time and culture from the perspectives of Chinese and Western phenomenologists. Though the discussions begin with classical phenomenological texts in Husserl, Heidegger or Merleau-Ponty, they extend to the problems of Daoism and Buddhism, as well as to sociology and analytic philosophy. The collection of this volume is a fruitful result of inter-cultural exchange of phenomenology.",
