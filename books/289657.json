When she decides to host a gathering of friends and guests for Trickster Night, at first everything is going well between the humans and the Others.

Now Vicki, human police chief Grimshaw, vampire lawyer Ilya Sanguinati, and the rest of their friends have to figure out who is manipulating events designed to pit humans against Others-and who may have put Vicki DeVine in the crosshairs of a powerful hunter--",
