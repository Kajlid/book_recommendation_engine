  "title": "No Doubt About It",
  "description": "\"Although there are many things about this life that I do not understand, there are some truths about which I no longer have any doubt. With that introduction, Sheri Dew of the general Relief Society presidency offers a faith-filled account of what she believes &dmash; and why. She bears powerful testimony of the reality of Jesus Christ, that He cares about us personally and will do for each one of us what He has promised He will do. She discusses our individual, unique missions of mortality, reminding us who we are and who we have always been. And she expands our understanding of the happiness that comes from living the gospel, the power of families, the importance of the priesthood, the security of having a living prophet, the glory of the temple, and the transcendent blessings available to all who seek the Lord. But No Doubt About It is much more than an insightful look at foundational gospel principle",
