Made my life easier because I went in and edited all the novellas again! Plus in Verses they are laid out in the order you need to read them. Book 5 in the series is in progress. The N'Loron is only days away from breaking in Athine's world. Strange beings are crossing over through the tears in the veil. Athine must choose between the stability of the N'Loron in her realm and her very life. Journey with Athine on her quest to fix the N'Loron. Will this be her last?",
