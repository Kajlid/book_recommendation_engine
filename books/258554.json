  "description": "\"Creata used to be my home planet. Having reached her limit of 9 billion people, our Planetary Government was looking for ways of sustaining such huge numbers.It was at this time that they became aware of me. They drew me into the fray and before I knew it, I became indispensable to their needs. A reluctant pioneer, they turned me into a tool to be used for their ultimate goal. I am Han and these are my stories . . . \"Part One, Learning Curve, introduces the reader to Han Storm as he awakens to his metaphysical abilities. It revolves around the first person, the 'I' or 'ego'. The wants and needs of the individual and there are a lot of 'I' in this section. This is where we all start with our lives. I, me and mine.But at some point this is no longer enough and we have to grow up, realizing that we cannot exist in a physical world with only ourselves, with only the 'I' for the 'I' becomes lonely in life. This is also an unsure time, where one must choose where you wish to go with your life or the choice will be made for you by destiny or other people. This is the time in your life when you need to start using your skills and inherent gifts.Complementary copy: https://www.smashwords.com/books/view...www.chroniclesofhan.com",
