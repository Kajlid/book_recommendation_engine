  "description": "Need is a word I use a lot. I need to put this criminal away for life. We need more evidence so the jury convicts. I need to work eighty hours a week minimum, harder and harder, so my community is safe. But I’ve never needed anything like I need her . Looking at her there is a new certainty. Something that can and will happen. I know this without a shadow of a doubt in my mind. She will be mine. Mine and mine alone. My dream girl, the only one that’s ever made me feel this way, ever caught my attention with such tenacity simply by existing, will be mine. Why is she there? What could someone so innocent have done to land them in an interrogation room? And more importantly, how can I get her out…how can I take that pain in her face away? Now.",
