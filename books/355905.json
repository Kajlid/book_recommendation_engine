  "description": "A parody of the fundamentalist Left Behind series, this humorous treatment of religion and politics criticizes the hypocrisy and greed of leaders of the American government and major political, educational, and religious organizations. Beneath the raucous humor lies a sophisticated examination of magical thinking and the End Times, creating a serious expos√© of fundamentalist religious leaders from a secular, freethinking, humanist viewpoint.",
