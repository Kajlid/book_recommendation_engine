  "description": "Torrenth is a stormy, watery world, home to five billion humans crammed onto a tiny island landmass. Having long ago defeated all natural causes of death, the citizens are functionally immortal â€“ which only exacerbates the massive stresses of overpopulation. Pontius has worked for the Newborn Corrections Unit for most of his 1,878 years. His efficiency in eradicating unlicensed humans is rivaled only by his sadistic corruption. He would be quite content to continue this profession for millennia until he finds the one child that he absolutely cannot eliminate. The resulting quest to honor his commitment and find a home for this child will force him to question everything he stands for. Every convention of Torrenth, and the underlying controls meant to maintain the public good, will stand against him.",
