  "description": "Joe Dawson is a driven young man, hard working, and eager to please his father. But Joe has a secret...perhaps he has a few. In small town like Holton, South Carolina, Joe is the biggest thing around: young, talented, destined for greatness. As the pressure builds from the outside, Joe feels close to snapping. He is not being honest with himself about who he is and what he wants. He must make a choice: be what everyone else wants him to be or strike out and be his own man.",
