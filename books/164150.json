He learns that things really CAN be different. These lessons come in the form of gifts - from the clouds, the trees, the mountain and even a butterfly. Steve Goodier, author of numerous inspirational and persoanl growth books, shows us that \"personal\" is not a dirty word. LESSONS OF THE TURTLE is informative as well as entertaining. A must read for anyone interested in making needed changes.",
