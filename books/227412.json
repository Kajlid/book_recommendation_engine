It follows six generations of the descendants of Martin Reed, who founded the 'House' dynasty through his act of rebellion in The Town House, through persecution, war and revolution, from the era of Christopher Columbus to the Restoration of Charles II. Written with Lofts' customary attention to historical detail, this is a series of stories about characters who lived and died for what they believed.",
