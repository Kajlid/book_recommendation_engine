  "description": "Growing up in a strict religious community, Sarah spent every day trying to live up to the expectations of those around her. When her parents announced they would be auctioning her off to provide for her brother's college education, she wondered why she wasn't as good as her brothers. She was disappointed and fearful until she met the four men she would marry, and then there was hope in her heart. Tired of being alone, Trystan found three other men of wealth to join with him to form a group to purchase the beautiful woman they wanted for their wife. Having been born from a pod, and never knowing a family, he couldn't understand what it would be like to have his parents sell him to four strangers. He didn't think much of what their new wife would be feeling until he realized that the people she'd trusted were the very ones to betray her. Could the five of them join together and form a cohesive family unit? Or was she destined to feel as if she were only a vessel to carry their children?",
