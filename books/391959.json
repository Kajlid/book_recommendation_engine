In the three years since, his crush has only grown. This partnership will surely end in disaster, but Nate cannot walk away.Quickly, Logan and Nate delve into the search for a missing socialite. Nothing else should occupy Logan's thoughts. The only problem? Nate is determined and sweet, and working with him awakens Logan's deepest desires. Logan won't break his laws, though. Not even for the gentlest, sexiest man in the world.Meanwhile, Nate is falling harder and faster for Logan every day they're together.

Nate will have to break every one of Logan's laws to capture the man of his dreams.Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Male/male sexual practices, violence.",
