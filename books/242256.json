  "description": "Rule Number One: Never date the boss.\n  Given Alexa’s crash and burn history with office romances, it should be an easy rule to follow. Then again, her rules have never gone up against Cash Campbell.  Her charming CEO boss has a way of looking at her that makes her feel as though she’s the center of his universe, and their constant flirting increases the heat whenever their eyes meet. His attention makes for an addictive, yet tricky situation.  But Cash likes to keep things light and simple. He doesn’t make promises he can’t keep, and maintains enough space to move fast in the boardroom—as well as in his love life. However, there’s something captivating about his assistant’s direct honesty that has monopolized his attention for almost a year. The problem is, he knows she’ll never date the boss…and he really needs this job. Even if he could date her, she likes things orderly and his life and problems are anything but.  When the two attend a wedding in the dreamy ocean town of Indigo Bay, they begin to wonder why they ever bothered following the rules. Because sometimes breaking the rules is the best way to discover the love of your life.",
