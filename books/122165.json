  "description": "Ross Trista Soul matesYou and Kelly share something special. I'd like to find my soul mate, too. Starting over in Chestnut Grove with an infant was such a major life change. At first, I wasn't sure if I was ready to move on, but it was time to stop dwelling on the past, so I took Kelly's advice and registered with a singles' Web site. I met the nicest e-mail buddy, but I also like your new assistant pastor, Scott Crosby. So, big brother, maybe this Thanksgiving we can all give thanks for our blessingsâ€•large and small.",
