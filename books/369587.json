  "description": "When young Kevin Kramer arrives at Saber Bend University as an aspiring running back, he finds instant success and acceptance. Not only does he score a starting position on the university football team (a rare feat for a freshman), but he also makes an impression on the fraternity president who ultimately chooses him to be his youngest brother. All Kevin’s dreams seem to be coming true, and at first life couldn’t be better, but there is a dark side to fraternity life. Success or not, he is still just a freshman and he has a lot to learn about life, friendship, and fraternity.",
