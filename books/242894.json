  "description": "Isolation is all I want. Until the goddess arrives.  Of all the mountains in the world, her sexy ass has to show up on mine.  Now, she can’t escape. Not from the blizzard. My cabin. Or the attraction neither of us can fight.  This mountain is mine alone, my escape from the wonderful life that imploded two years ago. But she’s here now, and the defenses I’ve erected are falling at her feet. She needs my protection. I need my hands on her perfect skin.  The goddess has become my obsession, but if she ever finds out what I’ve done, I'll lose her. I'll lose myself.  *** This is a full length novel with a happily ever after, no cliffhanger, no cheating, and plenty of steam. Bonus content included. ***",
