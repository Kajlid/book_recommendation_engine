  "description": "Twenty-one-year-old Ernie isn't prudish about wearing his sexy Spiderman costume that leaves little to the imagination. After all, he's ready for some spicy action as his Halloween treat. Granted, he'd still prefer having a boyfriend over a meaningless hookup, even though he's never known what love is, but his exes turned out to be a waste of his time. He's been leaning toward older men these days because guys his age never seem to know what they want. Still, a little fun along the way wouldn't hurt, would it?Enter twenty-nine-year-old Logan, a hookup who's more beautiful and irresistible than any man Ernie has ever met, perfect for a Halloween treat. But after an awkward misunderstanding, Logan turns out to be asexual, and he isn't so easy to get in bed with. So much for a spicy treat! In fact, a big part of his romantic past still surrounds him and Ernie when they meet for the first time, and it's impossible to avoid. While not all asexual people are against having sex, Logan still has his limits and won't do all the things Ernie finds more pleasurable. Logan may not find anyone sexually attractive, but he has a big heart to offer as a sweeter kind of treat.This unexpected new experience confuses Ernie as he gets to know Logan some more. He's used to only one way to love a man, or in his personal experience, no way at all. Being around Logan can be a challenge for both Ernie's heart and body. Can he look past Logan's limits and give this sweet treat a chance? Is there something deeper than anything Ernie's ever felt?",
