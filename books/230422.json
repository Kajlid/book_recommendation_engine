  "title": "Seasons With Sojourners: A Doctor's Story Working with Refugees and Outcasts in the World's Hard Places",
  "description": "\"Pushing carts, pulling suitcases, carrying babies, and dragging old folks, the endless procession in winter coats and mud-caked boots struggles up wintry hills. Gaunt faces reflect the silence that pervades when there are no more words to shout, when the well of tears has been drained, and the deluge of grief has drowned all other feeling. In a funeral cortège for a country and a way of life, the outcasts trudge on, mile after mile, hour after hour. At the top of a knoll, a weed-covered marker mutely announces the border of Albania. An Associated Press photographer standing next to it snaps a picture of the latest refugees from genocide.”Three days later the picture became front page news. Seeing it awakened threads to Dr. Reitzug’s refugee past. In the anguished faces he saw his own family’s season on the run. Moved, he soon found himself practicing medicine in refugee camps and in the hard places of disaster.Traveling by canoe, helicopter, Mekong River Speedboat, Land Rover, and Russian Jeep where there were no roads, Dr. Reitzug found heartache and joy, dodged danger, and ministered to the sojourners of our days in their season of need.",
