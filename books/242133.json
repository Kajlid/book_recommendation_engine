  "description": "Iphigenia Holt is a good little witch who grew up under the thumb of a wicked mother and two powerful sisters. Pegged as a caretaker, Iphi hides a secret that would change the way everyone around her views her: she’s an empath. And yet she doesn’t let that stand in her way. A soaring circus performer with a fierce love for animals and the downtrodden, Iphi tumbles her way through life, hiding the hurt just being around others can inflict...  ...Until she meets an enigmatic vampire and his three hot shapeshifting cousins. Drawn to the brightness she shines into their lives, each man promises to transport Iphi from the monotony of her life into a world truly filled with magic. They offer her love, protection—and an unconventional arrangement that will make her the scandal of Distant Edge.  But when a rogue vampire attacks Iphi, it’s time for the men to step up and for Iphi to fight back the only way she knows how: with love, compassion, and her inner radiance. If love can’t conquer evil, her four protectors are more than willing to bare tooth and claw at her side—whether she’ll have them or not.  A paranormal, urban fantasy reverse harem series. This is book 1 out of 3 in the Tales From the Edge Series.",
