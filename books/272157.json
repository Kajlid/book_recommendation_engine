Reviewers are calling it 'heartbreaking', 'mysterious' and 'fast-paced'. In a world ravaged by the dead, our words are all we have left. Who will tell the story of the last stand? I will. My name is Winter, and this is my story. The world has been lost to a new strain of rabies, one that ravages those it infects and turns them into blood-thirsty killers. I don't know how I've survived for so long, but I have. And then, I met a group ... I met him. Winter's Plague is the found memoir of a cowardly survivor in a cruel world. Winter writes of how she wandered across the states to find her sister, only to find the first group of survivors she'd seen in five months.A band of thirty survivors are led by the mysterious soldiers, but Winter quickly realises that Leo——the one who saved her life, the one in charge——has a secret. And it lies in the restricted RV with the top-secret cargo.But there are two rules she learns fast in the group: Know your place and stay away from the restricted R.V. Or die.",
