  "description": "This is a full-length novel (approximately 110K words).  Warning: This story contains contains explicit language, sex, and violence. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  My name is Livia Ash. It's an alias. The secrets and lies don't end there.  As a teenager, I was forced into a dark life, my freedom and innocence ripped out from under me. To get out, I had to become like the very people I hated, people who had no problem spilling blood just to make a point.  It almost cost me my own life, but I did it. Battered and broken, but determined to start over, I ran. Right into the path of Cameron \"Torch\" Larter, nomad member of the Iron Serpents Motorcycle club. Overbearing, rude, and intimidating, he was everything I didn't want to deal with. But this rugged biker Adonis -- with his piercing eyes and sharp tongue -- also got under my skin.  Forgetting him proved to be just as hard as breaking free from a life of crime. Neither happened. And by the time our worlds collided a second time, old enemies and new threats meant that I couldn't act on my desires. But Torch wasn't a man who took no for an answer.  Could two very different breeds of outlaws on a warpath ever unite without ending up on a cold slab or prison cot?  This is our story.",
