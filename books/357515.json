  "description": "In the Alaskan darkness, it's not just the cold that bites.  Meet Vivian. She's a 580-year-old vampire who exudes sensuality, has a talent for drama, and is passionate about two things: her human husband, Rafe, and their resort for the undead. Her ability to project physical illusions has created the perfect vacation spotâ€”a dark, isolated Alaskan hideaway where visitors can have their wildest fantasies come true.  Vivian knows the best performance requires perfect timing, but the powerful vamp is put to the test when she discovers a corpse in a locked guestroom minutes before the next arrivals. Always cool-headed, Rafe hides the body, convinced he and Vivian can find the culprit without disturbing their guests.  Juggling the increasingly outrageous demands of their customers while tracking a killer isn't easy. Will their poking and prodding give them the answers they need, or will it uncover secrets Vivian would kill to protect?
