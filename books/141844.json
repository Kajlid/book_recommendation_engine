  "title": "Daily Reflections Through Art and Image",
  "description": "This book was created with the intention of putting something beautiful and inspiring into the world. As a daily reflection book, it is meant to offer images of art and nature that can be used to gaze at, meditate on, and instil a sense of wellbeing. There are few words in the book because the intention is to engage the visual, creative side of the brain. This part of the brain can inspire new ideas, help take in other points of view, and offer new ways of resolving problems. Nature and the outdoors promote a sense of peace and oneness, and images of nature can bring that feeling back even when we can't get outdoors. Art evokes many positive feelings such as calm, appreciation of beauty, wonder, and even inspiration to create something new. The book encourages ritual and sacredness through enriching practices which can give a sense of purpose and meaning, as well as bringing feelings of stability and safety. The reader is invited to take one day at a time, appreciate the little things, notice their surroundings, and be present with themselves, others and the world around them. This book is a feast for the eyes and the soul. It is a reminder that every individual is unique, wonderful, loveable, and worthy simply for who they are. Using Daily Reflections Through Art & Image presents the opportunity to start each day with a positive and fresh frame of mind and being.",
