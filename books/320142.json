  "description": "An uplifting novel about new beginnings disguised as failed plans and the joy of falling in love all over again, from USA Today bestselling author Nancy Naigle.\nMerry Anna Foster just moved to Antler Creek, North Carolina. It's not a forever move, just a little sabbatical following an ugly divorce that destroyed her self-confidence. A three-month bet with her freeloading ex-husband, intended to prove she can live on less, has Merry Anna shedding her high-expense, demanding lifestyle to live simply. Now she has just two goals: win the wager and say yes to new opportunities. Soon she finds herself renting a small place in town, working in a gift shop on Main Street, and loving every minute of her low-key, no-major-responsibility life.Adam Locklear is the most eligible bachelor in town, but that doesn't mean he's available. The rodeo-loving owner of the Antler Creek Feed Mill is laser-focused on his goals, and they don't include settling down...yet. He is curious about the quiet woman who just arrived in town, though. There's an immediate spark between them, almost as if they'd known each other before.But not long into their new friendship, Adam is unexpectedly thrust into solo parenting his young daughter he's never met, leaving Merry Anna questioning his motives--while struggling with her own growing attraction toward him. To complicate things further, Merry's ex-husband shows up and desperately tries to reconcile their relationship. Merry Anna must trust her restored confidence and follow her heart to make a choice. And she may end up surprising everyone--including herself.",
