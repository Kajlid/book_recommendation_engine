  "description": "You are cordially invited to the wedding of Jacob “Dancer” Blake and Carolina Grace. \n   Dancer:   Dancer has spent the last few years devoting his life to the things that are most important to him. His club, his daughter, and his woman. Carrie means everything to him. Absolutely everything. Now that old ghosts from the past have finally been laid to rest, he’s decided it’s time to make Carrie his—legally. She deserves the best. She deserves to have every dream come true. This Valentine’s Day he’s going to do everything in his power to make sure that happens.  This is a NOVELLA at 23k in length. It's a quick read, made for those who want to make sure that Dancer not only heals from the darkness of the past, but embraces his future. It’s sweet, happy, and contains zero drama. Its sole purpose lives to either make the reader happy or give them a toothache…maybe a little of both.   You might also glimpse all your Savage Brothers favorites.  *This is a Novella only. You must have read Saving Dancer to understand this couple. Maybe you could read it without the other, but then why would you want to?",
