  "title": "The Vendetta Clause",
  "description": "The Bracken family charts their return to power with an audacious and dangerous plot that carries great risk and the promise of even greater reward. In the impoverished city of Madora, new challenges threaten to obstruct them before they've even gotten started, including a merciless trade outfit with a penchant for dealing in blood and the mysterious swordsman known as the Defender. But the real dangers skulk in the distance, waiting. Whether it be the treacherous wastelands Sierra must cross to bring her dragon, Nemi, home, or powerful rival families and the chancellor who are consolidating power in Cumeria, the lives and ambitions of all of the Brackens are balanced on a razor's edge. THE VENDETTA CLAUSE, the second book in The Cumerian Unraveling Trilogy, contains two maps, an appendix of names, and roughly 100,000 words.",
