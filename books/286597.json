  "description": "Restaurateur Zafir Iordanou is living in a kitchen nightmare. Outspoken chef Tatiana is sick of the kitchen, dad Spiros has given up trying to run a restaurant altogether and is now unsettlingly obsessed with taxidermy, and Head Chef George is…well…let’s just say George is moving on.  It takes a very special kind of chef to want to take a job in a restaurant whose Yelp reviews are fast becoming the stuff of viral legend, and luckily for Zafir there’s one chef in New York who’s both crazy and desperate enough to rise to the challenge – his hot-headed British ex, Rory Crouse, the one that got away.  It’s been seven years since Zafir and Rory had a wild summer love affair in Cornwall, but the feelings linger on, made even more complicated by the gambling habit that Rory acquired while working in Las Vegas. Rory – hooked on the thrill of the near miss – can never walk away from a winning streak. As the two of them rekindle their second chance romance, it becomes increasingly clear to Rory that he’s going to have to fight his own tendency to self-sabotage all the way, or risk losing Zafir all over again.",
