It was bad enough his dad left, but even worse, he must move to his grandparent’s remote ranch on Nowhere Mountain, leave his friends and school behind, and give up playing baseball. But now Grandpa is dead and Grandma adopts a wild burro, expecting him to train the long-eared donkey with a noisy bray.",
