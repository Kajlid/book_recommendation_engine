  "description": "Sebastian Knight is an ordinary nineteen year old who struggles to juggle his hated bartending job and his university studies as well as fitting in time for partying and family. The amazing opportunity for him to earn some easy money is thrown into his lap by one hot George Clooney type at the bar one night, and he jumps at the chance to become a male escort. But the very man who set him on this journey is the one who keeps calling him up and forcing Sebastian to feel for him when all he wants is to enjoy his newfound freedom and money. Sebastian and Robert are drawn together in a way neither have ever experienced, but when the money is paid, and the clock shows their time is up, they reluctantly continue on with their lives. Desperate for their happy ever after, and willing to fight to keep together, Robert and Sebastian stop at nothing to achieve what they know they both need.",
