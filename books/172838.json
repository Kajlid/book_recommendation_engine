  "description": "A fiancée. I’m going to Chicago to pretend to be some Italian Stallion’s future wife. Why a massive hunk, boxer, and rich restaurateur needs a fake bride is beyond me. Then again, I’m not paid to know why. I’m paid $100,000 to be his escort, or in this case, the woman he’s supposedly “going” to marry. The moment I met Antony “Tony” Fasano, I thought I might have lost my ability to breathe. In my twenty four years of life, I’d not seen anything like him. Clad only in a small towel precariously dangling from his hips--water droplets streaming down every inch of his muscular frame--I knew right then and there, I’d finally seen male perfection in all its raw glory.What happened next blew me away. It was now abundantly clear why he needed me...a fake fiancée. ***Mia Saunders continues her mission to save her comatose father from her dangerous, loan-shark ex-boyfriend. This month, she serves as a high-priced escort to a restaurateur named Anthony Fasano in the windy city of Chicago, Illinois. Each installment in the Calendar Girl Serial will release every month throughout 2015. The stories will feature Mia’s journey as an escort to twelve clients in twelve different locations.  This book is designed for audiences 18+ due to language and graphic sexual content.",
