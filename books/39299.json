  "description": "Echo Martins is a strong willed, brutally honest, terminally sarcastic sixteen year old that just happens to see the future on occasion. She has never tried to hide what her mother calls ‘her gift’. To Echo, ‘the gift’ is more like a curse. Now facing expulsion and possible arrest for a disaster she actually prevented, Echo is given the opportunity to instead go to a place called Alpha Tech. Even her mother tries to convince her it is for the best, assuring her that the ‘boarding school’ is a school for kids like Echo. Detention home is more like it. Alpha Tech is not what Echo expected. Surrounded by other kids that are special just like her, Echo finds herself part of a world she never knew existed, unwrapping mysteries of her past and finding others that hold the key to her future.",
