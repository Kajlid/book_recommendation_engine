  "title": "Karski: How One Man Tried to Stop the Holocaust",
  "description": "Working for the Polish Underground, Jan Karski witnessed first hand the horrors of the Holocaust. Surviving Soviet captivity and Gestapo torture, he escaped Poland in 1942 and embarked on a heroic crusade to give Allied leaders his eye witness report of Nazi extermination of European Jews. Karski is the first definitive account of the little-known episode--one of the earliest documentations of atrocities to reach the west and perhaps the most significant warning of the genocide to come. Karski's story introduces vital new insights about the Polish Underground, and about the Allies' reaction to the Holocaust.",
