  "description": "Best-selling romance author Stu Summers expects fawning praise and flirtatious smiles from his female fans, but when his editor at New York's Little Brown Pelican informs Stu that his latest manuscript is a poor imitation of a Nicholas Sparks novel, Stu's carefully crafted career begins to unravel. Stu has one week to deliver a complete rewrite of Lap Dog Love that meets his editor's demanding standards. And he would ... if he could ... but Stu can't writeâ€”at least not romance novels. For years Stu has paid a \"Holy Ghost writer\" on the Outer Banks of North Carolina to craft his manuscripts, but now Hattie May Hall has lost that loving feeling and feels God calling her to write paranormal Amish thrillers with an evangelical message woven into \"End Times\" sci-fi. With a looming deadline and no hope of learning how to write a novel in two weeks, Stu finds himself falling for Kate Winston, a self-defense-products rep who sells pepper spray, assault alarms, and personal stun guns. Kate instantly becomes Stu's source of inspiration but is his sudden affection for her real or, like everything else about Stu, ... fake? As the clock ticks closer to midnight, an unlikely pair of hearts collide, providing a \"shocking\" climax to a love story that was never meant to be and yet ... is.Written for the General Market (G) (I): Contains little or no; sexual dialogue or situations, violence, or strong language.",
