Xavier's tempting declarations of marriage are over shadowed by the ominous warnings of a dead man, leaving her to ponder if there can ever be a happily-ever-after for Xavier, Marco, or Sebastian? For her? Finding herself in Victoria's crosshairs, Elaine begins to see the bigger picture unfold and claims her role in the Society's diabolical play-acknowledging that since coincidences are rarely the work of fate, it's time to create a little chaos of her own.",
