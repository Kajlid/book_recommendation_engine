  "description": "In the blink of an eye, my life was turned upside down. Once more. Right from the start, I knew he had to be the most attractive guy I’ve ever met. The most arrogant. The most popular. Wild. Free. The only one I ever wanted - or craved. Also the only person who’s torturing me with cruel pain, though. Hellhounds. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Sorrow, delusion, savage persecution. Infinite agony. He was the only one I ever wanted. And he’d gladly watch me burn in purgatory. Light and darkness. Innocence and abyss. Good and evil. Sense and sensibility. He’s my biggest nightmare. Nevertheless, we never really stood a chance. Because one world is trying to keep us apart, while the other one goes to great lengths to unite the two of us. Both will put us to the test. A third party will have to decide. But arrangements, contracts and rules aside - love is the greatest power on earth. It’s our battle, our destiny. Neither him, nor me, are willing to lose. Yes, we were cursed. Starcrossed, cursed, lovers. Why? Because Morgan Vegard is my soulmate.",
