  "title": "Uprooted: An Anthology on Gender and Illness",
  "description": "This anthology features essays, poems, and works of fiction that explore the intersections between illness, gender, sexuality, and identity. These moving narratives share personal, political, and even contradictory stories about what it is like to face disease. Proceeds from the ebook will go to printing and mailing the book to healthcare, art therapy, and medical education centers in the U.S. With this initiative, we hope to start conversations about gender and sexuality with patients and providers.
