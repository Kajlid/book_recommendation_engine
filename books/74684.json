  "description": "She swore it was ‘just sext’, and nothing more…Lauren has been texting for months with a man she met online, carefully editing the details of her life, sending him only the best of herself—the hottest pictures, the highlights of her day, and her most hard core sexual fantasies. A merchant marine, he traveled the world, so it was safe enough. They would never actually meet, so why not? Her self-esteem could use a little boost.Marc’s “no talking, only texting” rule was strictly enforced when it came to the sexy thing he met online. She was his ultimate fantasy girl and he wanted to keep it that way. But when his ship is scheduled to dock in a port near her home, he lays it all on the line for the chance at a weekend of hot sex—and maybe something more.When they finally meet, the heat that smoldered for months feels a lot like love. Forced to tease reality from fantasy, months of texting foreplay ignites into wildfire—something hotter, deeper and sweeter than they had ever imagined.Box set available now at iTunes, Amazon and Barnes and Noble.",
