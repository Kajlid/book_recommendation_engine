  "description": "A mother and daughter face the challenges of learning disabilities in this heartfelt, uplifting story. Rosemary Enrico watches her daughter trudge home from school weighed down by a backpack filled with books she can’t read. Common words her classmates learned in kindergarten stump Dawn. Girls who’d been her friends in preschool no longer come to play. Even worse, the class bully seizes every opportunity to mock and harass her. Why can’t Dawn read? The teachers offer Rosemary reassurance, not answers. They say Dawn’s every bit as bright as her older brother, who has honor roll certificates galore. Though she tries, nothing Rosemary says cracks Dawn's conviction that she's dumb. Certain Dawn will read when she's ready, Frank Enrico tells Rosemary her constant worrying undermines their daughter. She reminds him that there was no reason to worry until Dawn's troubles in school began. Early in September, when a substitute gives a review spelling test, Dawn discovers she's even dumber than she thought. Every single word is wrong. That evening, when homework yet again crowds out a bedtime bath, Dawn tells Rosemary she wants to crawl back inside her belly and be born smart. A bright child’s struggle galvanizes growth in her family and beyond, changing the dogmatic superintendent of schools and her troubled son.",
