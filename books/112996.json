  "description": "‘More 1984 or Animal Farm than your traditional zombie fest of blood and gore’‘From the beginning to the end it had me in suspense, questioning what I believe and what I understand now’‘It drew me in to feeling that I was evolving the story with [the author]. This was underlined by the way we are led into the twist at the end’‘[Think Zombie] offers many penetrating insights into the ills of modern society and all told is a sharp and witty political polemic with a clear philosophical message’The first to turn was Kate, mutilating her family. Other zombie outbreaks followed, the country rapidly turning into anarchy. But what was causing it to happen? It seemed like some kind of virus, a zombie plague, but this was very different. It just didn't make sense. Kate’s friend Laura, believed she knew the answer, but no one was listening. Could she really be the only one to have worked it out? Even she struggled to believe her explanation, but surely someone would want to at least listen? Would she be able to get to talk to the right people before she fell victim to the zombies? Even with her knowledge, would they be able to stop it? And what of the mysterious new philosophy that more and more people seemed to be talking about?Think Zombie is a novel set in the early 1990s about a zombie apocalypse, the power of information, organisational ineffectiveness and how a few determined and extraordinary people can make a difference. The truth behind the zombies is mindblowing, but through a series of discussions, no one is left in any doubt that it really could happen.Think Zombie is the debut publication of Jason Ernest and is an original, self-contained, genre-changing zombie novel.",
