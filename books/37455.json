  "title": "A Goodreads Gallimaufrey",
  "description": "Gallimaufrey – an almost obsolete culinary term meaning a hotch-potch or motley collection of items. This is an anthology of short stories, non-fiction, poems and recipes from the authors and readers of the Goodreads UK Amazon Kindle Forum. You will find funny, supernatural, serious and silly here and there’s even a short visit from a lady vampire. Easy recipes from our site’s threads complete the collection. The forum is a happy, friendly, book-centred place where readers and authors enjoy interaction and mutual respect and this book is our first joint venture.",
