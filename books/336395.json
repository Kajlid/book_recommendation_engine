  "description": "Literally left holding the bag after a botched underworld deal, I know I’m gonna do time.Two years as it turns out.But spotting her moments before I’m grabbed. As we slam into each other for what I hope won’t be the last time…I see our future in her eyes, and in her belly.The babies I instantly know we have to have together.And if she can keep this bag I’m carrying.Keep it safe. Keep it a secret.Then our future is gonna be golden.But there’s more at stake than just the loot.I crossed a line that night. Pissing off the wrong people by helping myself to their cash, and falling so hard for a younger, heavy-set girl so hot I think I just passed the earth’s core.Two years apart is an eternity. And I only learn just how much danger I’ve put her in the day I make parole.I should’ve claimed her on the spot, should’ve done things a thousand different ways.But I’m out now. And I’m coming for what’s rightfully mine.I just hope I can get to her, and the bag before they do.",
