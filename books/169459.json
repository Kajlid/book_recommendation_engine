  "description": "Sebastian was turned into a vampire on his eighteenth birthday by his mother, whom he thought had died ten years earlier. His mother teaches him how to live amongst humans without spilling human blood. Almost two centuries later, his mother is killed and he blames humans.  After a year of brutally killing humans to exact vengeance, he comes upon the young child of a woman he just killed. He can’t bring himself to hurt the girl, so he names her Hanna after his mother, and finds a family to raise her. He anonymously provides for her, making sure her new parents have all the money they need to ensure she has a good life. Sebastian disappears from Hanna’s life to better himself for all the killings he has committed.  Although Hanna is out of his life, Sebastian can’t get her out of his head, and believes his love for her is like a father. He reappears in her life seventeen years later to see how she is faring, only to see that Hanna has grown into a beautiful woman. He falls in love with her all over again, but this time as a lover.  He plans an “accidental” meeting, which does not go well. Before Sebastian leaves Hanna once again, he learns that vampires and wolves are after her. Now it is up to Sebastian to secretly guard Hanna’s life.  Publisher’s website:http://sbprabooks.com/ElizabethJohnson",
