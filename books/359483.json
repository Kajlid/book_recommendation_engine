  "description": "MakaylaMoving back home to Cactus Springs, Texas was quite literally the last thing I wanted to do, but it beats sleeping under a bridge in Houston… barely. I can handle my dad’s fascination with entomology, and my step-mother’s smothering form of love, but what I can’t abide is my step-brother and his smart-ass mouth.Walker positively lives to harass me, but with just three days to get across the Lone Star state, his car is my only option. Which means he is my only option. The only question is, how far can we make it without killing each other?WalkerThe last time I saw my stepsister, she was all bony angles and sassy mouth. She swore up and down that she’d never set foot back in Cactus Springs, but here she is. The mouth hasn’t changed one bit, but the rest of her? Those curves have me biting my knuckles and praying for mercy.I never should have offered to drive. I should have shut my mouth and let her find another way to her interview… but I didn’t. I let the soft spot I harbor for her get the best of me and now I’m stuck with her. Stuck in the car. Stuck in hotel rooms. Stuck next to the one woman who cannot stand me. Stuck with the only woman I’ve ever wanted.EVERYTHING’S BIGGER IN TEXAS SERIESEverything’s Bigger in Texas, including love.
