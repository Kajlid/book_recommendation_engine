  "description": "Before Carissa has time to react to her sister's disappearance, she's kidnapped and taken deep into the Colorado mountains. Her kidnapper swears he's protecting her, but Carissa doesn't know what to believe. He emanates danger, strength and raw sexuality. She's drawn to him, craves his demanding kiss and the slide of his hard body against and into hers.Quinn has always been an outsider, scorned and mistrusted by other Therian shapeshifters. Now he's in the middle of a budding civil war and he's not sure how to disentangle himself without endangering Carissa. Though her powers are latent, Carissa has the potential of becoming the most powerful Therian the world has ever seen. It was Quinn's intention to bring Carissa to safety and simply walk away, but one taste of her sweet lips and he knows he'll never let her go. She won't be truly safe until she's selected her mate-and he intends to be the one she chooses.",
