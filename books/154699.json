They may only play teens on TV but when it comes to romance, these twenty-somethings still have lessons to learn.From the scheming ex determined to cash in on a rising star, to the hunky high school crush resurrected from ancient history—from the nice guy with a naughty past, to the snarky diva with attitude—there’s plenty of scandalous hidden affairs and seriously sexy demons hiding in just about everyone’s closet on Coconut Cove.You just have to be ready to drink it in. Bottoms up … or should we say off?",
