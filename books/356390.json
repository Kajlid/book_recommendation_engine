She’s not only petite in stature, she’s toothpick-thin, and her clothes say “thrift shop.” Her stance says “don’t mess with me.” But if you take a closer look, you’ll see a haunted expression in her eyes. Donovan Pfarr takes a closer look. And can’t turn away when he realizes that she goes hungry most of the time. He feels compelled to help her. But he how did Fallon end up living in a run-down trailer taking care of her mentally-unbalanced mother, barely eking out an existence on her meager paycheck from the convenience store where she works? The answer comes when a man involved in an event from Fallon’s childhood learns he is dying. He tries to make peace with his conscience by setting up an anonymous trust fund for Fallon. And unleashes a force that puts Fallon and Donovan in deadly peril.",
