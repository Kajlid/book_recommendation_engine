  "description": "Robin Love's father has been missing in action for over a year. A true proud army brat at almost eighteen, Robin already knows how to be strong and how to be her brother’s only family. Above all, she knows to pretend everything will be fine. Only, things aren’t fine. Robin discovered that her brother will get dumped in foster care when she leaves for college. So, she’s convinced him to run away with her instead.  They’ve vowed to stay together at all costs. Even if it means stealing food out of hotels, sleeping in the car, and lying about everything. Even if it means working as a secret nanny for a jerk rock star who only cares about his band. And even if it means trusting strangers while she formulates her plan. She never expects her lies to lead them to true friends and a real home. Nor does she expect to be attracted to the boss she's growing to hate, all because he refuses to act like the honorable and 'good father' she misses desperately.  But secrets like a runaway girl and a baby hiding with a famous band can’t be kept secret for long. Robin is also not the only one telling lies. When an accidental kiss—a kiss that never should have happened—threatens Robin’s ability to keep her brother, Robin will do anything to correct her mistakes. But this time, to save her brother, the cost might be her heart.",
