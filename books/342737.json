For six years of marriage, Larry and Elisa spent their spare time on the country club and horse racing circuit. But then his perfect life went perfectly wrong. On September 10, 2001, Larry attended a horse show . . . and disappeared.Months later, police put out a missing persons report. They soon discovered that Elisa McNabney was not the person she had claimed to be. A fugitive on the run, Elisa was a con woman who had enlisted the help of a girlfriend to slowly poison her loving husband with horse tranquilizers—all in the name of pure greed. Larry was found buried in a vineyard, after Elisa kept his corpse in her deep freezer for months. The only thing more appalling than the horrific murder was the shocking manhunt that followed and the end to this tragic story of deception, murder, and deadly seduction.",
