But he's oblivious to the fragile balance of life, until something unutterly strange strips way the surface clam of his existence and exposes a universe that proves uncontrollable and endlessly mutable.For Jesse has become the focus of conspiracy of creatures from beyond the end of time to re-create our universe anew. Blinded by sex and greed, Jesse can't see the terrible flaw in their vast plan...until a wonderful woman names Sully comes into his life and turns everything right side up.The result is a wild, erotic joyride, a no-holds-barred tour de force, and, finally a novel of sublime grace and beauty, a testament to the transcendent power of love.",
