  "description": "The Snickitysnatcher lies awake after a century asleep. He only has ten years before he has to go back into hibernation. He only has ten years in which to unleash his terror on the world around him, but first he must win an ancient game which serves as a right of passage to his reign of terror and that ultimately gives him the unrestricted right to his prey.Â He has learnt to choose his opponents wisely; taking advantage of those who are easily manipulated, but this time around there is someone standing in his way who will not back down or be tricked. It is not someone whom anyone would expect to stand up against a monster. The Snick, who has not had his will challenged for centuries, is worried. Follow the journey of a young girl who is pitted against the lies and tricks of an ancient evil as she desperately tries to save her friends and countless other innocents from the shadowy Snickitysnatcher. The duel plummets her into a game of cat and mouse as she transverses her everyday reality into a magical world not far from her beloved town. As she draws closer towards a final confrontation with unfettered evil unusual alliances are made and the hope of defeating the monster begins to form in her heart.",
