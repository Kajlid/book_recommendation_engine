  "description": "A theft, a murder, a treasure hunt, and a palette-full of secrets.In this riveting sequel to Murder in the One Percent, Detective Oliver Parrott delves into the art world of Brandywine Valley, where two valuable paintings have been stolen from the studio of the renowned artist, Blake Allmond.\tAt first it seems like a routine property crime, but as soon as Parrott investigates, he discovers the Allmond family’s propensity for tragedy. When someone is murdered, it’s a game changer, and plowing through a family’s secrets leads the reader through a murder, a treasure hunt, and a slew of characters who may or may not be trustworthy.\tThe glamour of the art world and the privilege of the wealthy landowners in Brandywine can’t protect them from trouble, but it takes Parrott to realize that there’s more to an artist’s palette than globs of paint.\tA Palette for Love and Murder has all the characteristics of a well-woven mystery, but with the additional layering of multi-dimensional characters and sometimes flawed relationships. Parrott and Tonya make a dynamic modern day Nick and Nora, sure to engage readers’ thoughts and to warm readers’ hearts.",
