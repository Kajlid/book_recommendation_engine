  "description": "Now you Seelie, Now you don't.  Layanna Fairling hasn't come all the way across the land to be trapped in Dragonscale. Using her wits, and her new found shape-shifting ability, Layanna and her team get free of a second tyrant king.  With the dragons by her side, the lost queen must make her way back to Althea. She has been gone longer than expected, allowing King Jordeek and the shroud, to reign over the land. Will Layanna defeat Jordeek before the shroud kills the kingdom, or will the evil king somehow give up the throne and return Althea back to its rightful ruler?",
