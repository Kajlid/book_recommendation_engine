  "description": "JENNIFER is a vintage young adult novel about a teen coping with her mother's alcoholism. \"Jennifer hurries into her room and closes the door softly. Her eyes fill with tears, and she doesn't even try to blink them away. 'Mother thinks I'm ashamed of her, I'm sure she does. She believes that's why I've never asked Griff or any of the other kids to come here--because I'm ashamed of her!' But even as Jennifer dashes the tears away, she knows that the saddest thing about it is ... it's true.\" (Goodreads) JENNIFER received the Children's Book Award for 1959. ABOUT THE Zoa Sherburne (1912 â€“ 1995) was an American author, most known for her young adult fiction. Her novels often dealt with girls in difficult coping with a mother's alcoholism (JENNIFER), with the remarriage of a parent (Almost April and The Girl in the Mirror), with an unexpected pregnancy (Too Bad About the Haines Girl), with guilt over a hit-and-run (Leslie). In her time slip story Why Have the Birds Stopped Singing? the stigma of epilepsy is added to the usual cultural disorientation, and in her paranormal tale The Girl Who Knew Tomorrow, the young psychic girl finds fame a mixed blessing. For JENNIFER, she received the Children's Book Award for 1959. (Wikipedia) ABOUT THE COVER Mimi Korach Lesser was a civilian commercial artist who sketched hundreds of portraits of soldiers recuperating in hospitals in Europe in WWII. She often signed them to her subject, who could then have the portrait sent home to his parents. She returned to New York City in 1945 after the war and became a freelance illustrator and street artist. From 1945 to 1970 she was an illustrator of books and covers for The Atlantic, Harpers, and the Heritage Book Club. (Legacy.com; Washington Post)",
