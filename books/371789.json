  "description": "This follow-up to the hugely successful The Matrix and Philosophy is broken down into seven \"scenes\" that explore some of the deeper issues in the movie series. Scene one examines the issues of fate, fortune, causation, and determinism in the trilogy. Scene two asks readers to consider the concept of freedom in the film and in \"reality.\" Scene three analyzes the metaphysical links and breakdowns between the three movies. Scene four provides exciting glimpses into the meaning of the music and the evolution of the Animatrix. Scene five addresses the controversial issues of race, humanness, and violence. Life, love, and the meaning of it all are considered in scene six, while scene seven looks at the various religious elements that appear throughout the series. The three films comprising The Matrix have become a genuine cultural phenomenon; this book enriches both the enjoyment of the films and the understanding of life today.",
