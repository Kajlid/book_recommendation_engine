  "description": "Hailed universally as Russia's finest comic writer, and by many as its greatest writer of prose, Nikolai creates a unique Ukranian world, from the darkest Gothic to folkloric levity. Here, this extraordinary countryside is revealed in all its variety in his first two collections of shortstories. The only translation available of this cycle of stories, this edition captures fully the spirit and vigor of his important early work for the first time.",
