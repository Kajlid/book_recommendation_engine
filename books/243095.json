  "description": "Eight stories play out in a brutal and honest retelling of World War 2 from the early months to the weary end. Eight young people from across the globe are torn from their lives and thrown into a world of steel and flame. Despair, tenderness, chaos, and love are laid bare amidst a backdrop of real events and raw history.Wally builds ships in Owen Sound while Toshiro trains at an airfield in Tokyo. Alice tries to keep her life from fraying in London while Yulia dotes on her children in Leningrad. In America, Patrick eyes war with dreams of heroism, unaware of the horrors already unfolding on the streets of Warsaw. Such was life in 1939 as the mechanisms of global statecraft were already wrenching our dear characters, and indeed the entire planet, into a clash that would set the world aflame and change the lives of every single member of the human race.Leave Us In Peace by Marty Elkins tells the story of World War 2 from many fronts and conflicting perspectives. What happened? What was it like? What was it all about? Leave Us In Peace answers these questions with beautiful prose and breathless pace to tell a story not just of gun, bomb, and blade, but ultimately, of humanity.",
