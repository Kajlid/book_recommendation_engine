  "description": "From the author's introduction:\"After all these ruinous decades writing 'poems', I have had to invent a form that doesn't seem like poetry at all: the Metefour. It's crazy, it's nonsense, it's the anti-poem, it's the impure-poem, etc. But it strikes me that it can be read, dammit, because the line is strangely fresh. Count it out: Four words in every line. You must be kidding? Say whut! Mr Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington told us, 'You got to say it without saying it.'\"",
