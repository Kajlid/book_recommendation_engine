  "description": "Lenore MacFinley, Lenny to her friends, is a homicide detective, and a damn good one. But when she finds herself next on the hit list, things turn deadly. Broke and critically injured, Lenny wants nothing to do with the handsome, bossy Were Tiger. Jules Golden finds himself tricked into meeting his new mate. He has made a name for himself as a potter and an artist, and is happy with his life the way it is. A new mate isn’t part of his carefully laid plans. “You’re my mate. Do you know what that means?” She nodded, then shook her head. “You either do or you don’t, Lenore. Which is it? Your understanding of our relationship is going to be much easier to explain if you have at least a little knowledge of what’s going on.” “Oh, I understand what it means. I just don’t care. I’m not going to be your mate and you aren’t going to get the opportunity to try and convince me otherwise.” Fate isn’t through with Lenny. The first attempt to take her life has failed, but the nemesis isn’t giving up and is determined that Lenny won’t make it to her 25th birthday. Lenny’s days are numbered and even those that can see the future admit to two possible outcomes, and Jule’s fate is tied to hers. Things heat up and the Golden’s Streak must band together again to protect their own, but when Jules inadvertently gets in the way will they be too late? Find out in the next installment of the Golden Streak Series―Jules.",
