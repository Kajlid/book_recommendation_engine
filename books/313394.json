  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Kella O’Malley is living through the apocalypse. Maybe.She’s definitely running from feral cannibals.When a pandemic begins mutating humans into killers during her spring break in Georgia, Kella joins with a group of teens and twenty-somethings to carry precious CDC data north on the Appalachian Trail. With no cell phones and no clue how far the mutation spreads, their only hope is to stay ahead of the “Hyenas” and hike faster than the world can end. “The end times are not what you were expecting,” Kella writes in the shelter logbook along the way. “Be prepared for a lot of stomach growling. And a serious lack of condiments.” “Also, take note: Cities overrun by feral human cannibals do not make for great spring break destinations. But on the bright side, it’s very unlikely now that boredom is what will kill you.”“Falling in love is terrifying. It ranks somewhere between murder hornets and being eaten alive by Hyenas.”",
