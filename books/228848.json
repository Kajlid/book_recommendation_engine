  "description": "Lily Thompson has watched over her little brother most of her life, so when he gets in trouble with the mob, she approaches Dante Moretti about settling his debt. He isn’t interested in her first offer and negotiates with a counteroffer—one that has her in his bed and at his mercy. She may be in over her head, but it’s her heart she has to worry about as she starts to warm up to the seemingly ruthless mobster, who finds her equally compelling. Can there be a happy ending for a Mafioso underboss and a sweet nurse, or is their negotiation destined to end in bullets and heartbreak?  Negotiation, Acquisition and Merger are part of the MAFIA ROMANCE series. They may be read as standalones, but reading all in order will enhance your enjoyment. All include super hot sex, no cheating and happily-ever-afters.",
