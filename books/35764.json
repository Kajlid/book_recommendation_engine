  "description": "Angelique Aubert owns her own lingerie store, “Secret Pleasures.” When shopping in New Orleans, she is harassed by four intoxicated men. A tall, handsome stranger and his brother, the sheriff, come to her rescue. She is instantly attracted to the two men but wary of their intentions. She is a survivor of an abusive relationship and doesn’t trust men, and her sisters are very overprotective of Angelique. She meets the sheriff again and his three handsome, muscular brothers when she volunteers to help as they build a new community center for handicapped children. They make it obvious that all four brothers want her. She's heard of ménage relationships before, but her fear that history may repeat itself stops her from taking a chance. The sexual attraction between Angelique and the four men is unstoppable. When trouble surrounds their construction company and accidents happen, Angelique is caught in the middle. Her men will do whatever they can to save her.",
