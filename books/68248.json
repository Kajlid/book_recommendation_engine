  "description": "A first-person, fictional account of the Jesus story, 'Becoming the Son' reveals fresh possibilities of who this God-Man could have been. Carefully researched, it explores clues to neglected areas of Jesus' life that can be found within the biblical and historical records. An unseen terror stalks Jesus from his childhood until his crucifixion as he stuggles to become who he already was. His parents don't understand how to raise this child of promise, especially against a backdrop of doubt and suspicion. The bewilderment of an emerging identity creates a complex series of encounters that open the eyes of some and turn others away. Truly human, Jesus' grows to face his limitations, his hopes, disappointments, sexual awareness, and the frustrations of the world around him in ways that invite all readers to reconsider the dignity of their own humanity.",
