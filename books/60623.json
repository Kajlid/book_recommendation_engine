  "description": "On stage she is Leather, a Rock'n'Roll fantasy. Her music dominates the charts, while the \"Queen of Flash\" struts across the concert stages. She is a tease, a shameless flirt--and a glittering illusion. Kate Costello has had enough of the music scene. She takes off for New Mexico in search of the anonymity she'd bargained away for fame. Jake Callahan is a single father. A decade ago his wife left the farm, leaving him to raise his daughter. He spent his savings bailing out his wild twin brother and is now facing cash-flow problems. Renting out the empty house on his property seems like an ideal solution until he sees the woman who answers the advertisement. Jake doesn't want the reclusive millionaire renting the house on his farm. But he has a teenager to deal with and bills to pay. And now--a sexy tenant he can't seem to ignore. Sparks fly between the cowboy and the rocker who believe they have nothing in common except a menagerie of goodhearted matchmakers determined to prove they'll make beautiful music together.",
