  "description": "How far would you go to change who you are? Turns out, pretty far when your mother is the Queen of Darkness. My name is Lili Trevil, and I don’t know if I’ll live to see tomorrow. All of the legends are real, and all of them want me dead. Angels stormed my home and murdered my father. Demons hunt me everywhere I go. My chance at a normal life went up in smoke with my childhood home. I thought I had my life figured out. Now I’m on the run, and I don’t even recognize my reflection. I made friends with a few Feyfolk, but they aren’t what they seem. The mage tells me the angels and demons won’t rest until they have my head. She tells me I’m not human. I’m a Camphelem, one of the most powerful Feyfolk born in centuries. The only problem is, I have no idea what that means. Two weeks ago, I didn’t even believe in angels.",
