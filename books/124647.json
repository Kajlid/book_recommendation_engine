He puts the children in the care of a young stepmother, fresh from a brothel, who looks after them during the week while he works at a remote building site. But the stepmother is soon driven away by the father's violent possessiveness. Depressed, the father no longer returns for his weekend visits, and the children are left to fend for themselves. U-mi attempts to care for U-il, with help from neighbours, but her despair leads her to mimic her father's behaviour, abusing the one person closest to her ...A beautifully written, deeply affecting story of a shattered childhood.Translated by Jenny Wang Medina.Oh Jung-Hee was born in Seoul in 1947. In the 1970s, when modernisation was in full force in Korea, she began her career as a writer and is now an uncontested master of this genre of brief, dense prose, the quintessence of Korean literature.",
