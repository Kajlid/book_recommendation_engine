  "description": "War doesn't forge heroes, it reveals them!Former Navy SEAL and communication specialist for The Four X’s Group—a paramilitary organization he runs with his brothers, Remi *Zipper* McKinley has slammed the lid shut on the box he stuffed his heart into. He chained that puppy up, slapped on a padlock, and tossed the key away with prejudice. Never again will he allow flowery words and empty promises to dictate his future. Love, feelings, and happy ever after are not for him. The only thing a wife brings is pain, betrayal, and a bank balance with a big fat zero. Been there, done that, and he’s got the damn t-shirt.For Serena Wayland the chance of vacationing on safari within her budget was too good to pass up. Her first clue something was wrong was when the destination changed, her second when her friend and traveling companion disappeared, and her third when she was abandoned by her guides in Uganda. Unless those gorillas watching her every move, have a phone and will let her use it—she’s up a certain creek and paddles didn’t come as part of her package deal.A favor for a friend sends Remi on the trail of a missing woman, the one he finds is not on his list. But his honor won’t allow him to leave Serena to fend for herself. He’s everything she ever desired. She’s everything he never knew his soul needed. But can Serena convince Remi she’ll protect his heart as fiercely as he protects his country?A woman in need, a man in pain and the only thing which can truly save them—the courage to face the greatest risk of love.",
