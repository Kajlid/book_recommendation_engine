  "title": "Son of Stone",
  "description": "After an eventful trip to Bel-Air and a reunion with his sophisticated, and very wealthy former love Arrington Calder, Stone Barrington is back in New York. He's looking to stay closer to home and cash in on his new partnership at Woodman & Weld. He does seem to be slipping into a routine though - Dino, dinner at Elaine's and other great restaurants, unpredictable Herbie Fisher, Bill Eggers and difficult new clients, and a mystery or two of the feminine variety. But Arrington has other plans for Stone...including introducing him to the child he fathered many years ago. There's even a bigger surprise for Stone and all of us. Or two.Librarian's note: the characters, settings and other information are complete as best possible (corrections are welcome!) for: #1, New York Dead, 1991; #2, Dirt, 1996; #3, Dead in the Water, 1997; #4, Swimming to Catalina, 1998; #5, Worst Fears Realized, 1999; #6, L.A.
