  "description": "\"I know you are not so brave, Anna Spencerford. You will do as I say.\"-The savage voice haunted Anna's mind. Crammed in their old red ford escort, the five Spencerfords, Alfred, Penelope, Anna, Dick & Alex, set out for the South of England to a very quirky wedding and to visit their elderly relatives. There they will meet the Jojoes, a cheeky pair of twins that will help them escape the boring household and introduce them to the wonders of their woods, camp and hidey holes and a ruined cottage. In the midst of a family drama, Anna finds that the discovery of the cottage will lead to much more than a simple game, as the ghostly figure of the Hangman will creep slowly into her life.",
