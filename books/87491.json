  "description": "When Hayden Chandler rented a house in Cherry Grove on Fire Island for the summer she was looking for nothing more than a quiet place to write. Accessible only by ferry, the island promised to give her the solitude she needed. But she hadn’t counted on the allure of the ferry driver; a headstrong, proud, prickly woman named Gina Scognamiglio. Gina is happy with her life, and she’s not quite ready to get into another relationship. But Hayden gets under her skin, and they wind up making a very quick trip to bed. Once that itch is scratched the women have to decide if there’s more between them than lust. They’re both fairly certain that their lives are too different to really mesh, but…still…there’s something that keeps leading them back to bed. Is steaming-hot sex enough to build a relationship on? Find out in Cherry Grove.",
