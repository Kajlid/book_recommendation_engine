  "description": "Mutahhari presented his signature approach of applying traditional Islamic sources to contemporary questions. He emphasized education outside of the classroom, such as learning through work. He discussed the importance of spiritual and moral training worship as a means of personal development. Although delivered in the 1970's these lectures remain essential reading for anyone involved in training or education.",
