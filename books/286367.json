  "description": "Wedding Planner Aria Scirocco has her life on track after her divorce—or so she wants to believe. She’s engaged to a stable and pragmatic man and her biggest client will wed this weekend at a historic hotel on the beach. Nothing can jeopardize all her hard work—until a snowstorm derails her plans and dumps unfinished business in her path. Hawk Egan wants his ex-wife back. When the storm strands Aria, he jumps at the opportunity to come to her rescue. Getting stuck in a hotel without power is a bonus. As long as the snow continues to fall, he has a shot to make her love him again. But it’s not just the storm in Aria’s way. Her past is as unclear as the blizzard at the shore thanks to Hawk’s unexpected return. When the snow stops and the power turns on again, she will either embrace the new life she created and forsake her truths or admit she wants the life she left behind.",
