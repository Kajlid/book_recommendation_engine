  "description": "Being stranded in remote Canada with a hottie?Wasn’t part of my summer plans.Dump my cheating ex? Check.Land an amazing job with Boston’s professional hockey franchise? Check.Fall stupidly in love with hockey’s favorite bad boy? Ugh.After wasting years of my life with the wrong person, I told myself all I wanted was a little no-strings fun. Enter Alex Braun—a wealthy, handsome, notorious playboy who’s equal parts charming and dangerous as hell to my wounded heart.After enduring a very public breakup of his own, the sexy player doesn’t want to be anyone’s forever. Too bad he barreled his way into my heart, instead of just my bed.But this professional athlete knows a thing or two about competing, and he won’t let go so easily.This romance contains one grumpy, emotionally damaged, but gorgeous-as-hell hockey player, and a whip-smart, hardworking heroine who’s never quite fit in. It should only be read by those who like their men brawny and their romances red-hot!",
