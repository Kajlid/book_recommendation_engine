  "description": "Today, God is preparing His people for a new move of His Spirit—a move that will commission a positioned people of God. But first, He will position those He has prepared for this great end-time ministry. And, in order to fulfill His plan, God is calling His people to commune with Him in a deeper, more intimate relationship, revealing new direction and vision to position those He has called to duty.I believe God is resounding loud and clear His word, “Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord…” (2 Chronicles 20:17). And, I believe with all my heart God has called you to an appointed position for an appointed time to fulfill this great move of God.Are you hearing His voice in this finest hour? Are you prepared, positioned and ready to see the next great move of God? In the following chapters, it is my privilege to challenge you with A Call To Duty, a most vital message for the Church today.",
