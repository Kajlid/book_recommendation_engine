  "description": "What do a wayward mercenary and a vexed arcanist have in common? Neither of them signed up for this crap . . . It's been fifteen years since the raknoth made a smoldering heap of Earth. But for some survivors, the problems are just getting started. Jarek Slater is a sword-slinging nomad with a powerful exosuit and a mean vigilante streakâ€”or was until his exosuit was stolen. He wants it back.Rachel Cross is an energy-bending arcanist who wants nothing more than to find her brother and bring him home safely.When their paths collide, Jarek and Rachel are reluctantly pulled into a race across the nuclear wasteland to reclaim his suit and save her brother. All that stands between them and their goals is a vicious alien warlord, some grating interpersonal tension, and a whole bunch of violent marauders. Oh, and a mysterious alien device that may bring on the second apocalypse.Together, they might just be strong enough to pull it off. Assuming they don't kill each other first . . .----------------------------------Red Gambit is the first book in the Harvesters Series, a post-apocalyptic sci-fi adventure complete with blood-sucking aliens, power armor, and energy-bending arcanists. If you like Star Wars, Halo, or the likes of Neal Asher, E.E. Knight, and Michael Anderle, you'll love this series for its \"fast-paced adventure,\" \"compelling characters,\" and \"wonderfully wise-cracking dialogue.\"",
