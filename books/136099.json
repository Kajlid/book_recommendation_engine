  "title": "America: A Prophecy - The Sparrow Reader",
  "description": "America: A Prophecy is the long awaited collection from the writer Robert Christgau called, \"one of the funniest men in Manhattan.\" From a hilarious spiritual guide to New York City—written after Sparrow tried meditating at a dozen high-traffic landmarks—to the scientific and religious significance of the sky, Sparrow’s unique blend of wit and wisdom gives readers a whole new way of seeing our country at the crossroads. The author of Republican Like Me, Sparrow challenged Bob Dole for the presidential nomination in 1996 and, remarkably, lost. America: A Prophecy is his follow up, a fantastical look at a country in flux by a mischievous poet and iconoclastic comedian.",
