His curiosity was getting the better of him and he needed to put to rest that nagging feeling that he might be gay.Admittedly, Cody Beaumont is dubious, though certainly not hesitant and after the first one, all he wants is more.And then there's Ashton Prince, the perfect guy, some might say too perfect.Putting their hearts on the line is the last thing they expected, if it weren't for that kiss.",
