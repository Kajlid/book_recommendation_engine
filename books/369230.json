  "description": "On her wedding day, Tara was abducted by the masterful Leon Petrides, dragged off to Greece and forced to marry him. And from the start it had been a real marriage, not an \"in name only\" one. Yet hadn't Tara any mind of her own at all? Why hadn't she flatly refused to marry him? Why didn't she try to run away? After all, she loved her fianc√© David, didn't she, and wanted nothing but to get back to him. This feeling she had for her pagan husband, a feeling she couldn't deny, was only physical attraction, wasn't it? So what was stopping her?",
