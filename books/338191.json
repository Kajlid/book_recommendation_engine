  "description": "Hide all you want. I will find you. I might not wear a cape or a mask, but as an agent for the SMU—Special Monsters Unit—I am plenty heroic. Most of the time. Accidents tend to happen a lot around me since I’m what they call a null witch. Someone who basically murders magic. Sounds cool, right? Not when it causes cursed folks to explode—literally—in my face. Gross. Not to mention I hate shopping for new clothes. Still, I love my job even if it is dangerous. Other parts of my life could use some help, though. My parentage is still a mystery.The guy I liked, well, let’s just say things got complicated.The boss hired someone new and annoying, and did I mention hot?Oh, and there appears to be ancient ruins under our town. I’d be more excited if the Cryptid Historical Society hadn’t shut us out of our own investigation.Whatever. There are plenty of monsters to go around in Nexus. Secrets too. Time for me to cause trouble in the name of good.",
