  "title": "The Quest for the Grail: Arthurian Legend in British Art 1840-1920",
  "description": "This fascinating and comprehensive account of Arthurian legend in British art in the nineteenth century offers new insights into the significance of the legends. Wide-ranging, both historically and thematically, it moves from Dyce's Arthurian frescoes in the Houses of Parliament in the 1840s to the use of Galahad in First World War memorial imagery. Based on substantial primary research, Poulson skillfully relates the visual treatments of the legend both to literature and music and to historical and social developments, such as the rise of nationalism, racial stereotypes, religious and scientific controversy, and debates about women's roles, rights and sexuality. The book also breaks new ground in relating images of the dying Arthur to nineteenth-century millenialism and scientific predictions of the death of the sun and the end of life on earth.",
