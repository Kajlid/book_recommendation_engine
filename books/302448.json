  "description": "Faeries, Humans, Hunters, Believers, and those in between. Seventeen year old Kathleen discovers a world within Ireland full of mischief, danger, darkness, hate, and love. She is only human, so why is she so important to the faeries of Ã‰ire? Is she the only girl her age who believes they are real, despite having never seen them before? Kathleen secretly believes in the Irish tales of the faerie folk that her mother told her when she was a little girl. When she returns home to Ireland, she is pulled into the world of faerie because of her belief in their existence. She is drawn into the war between faeries, humans, and faerie hunters, creatures that are neither faerie nor human. Kath may be human and innocent, but she has power inside of her that she is unaware of, power that both faeries and hunters would kill for. It doesn't help that she finds herself falling for the king of the darkest fey in Ireland, fey who would kill her as soon as look at her, and one in particular who would do all he could to destroy her.Don't miss out on the next Faerie Believer novels:Ironic HeartsBroken BeautyAvailable now on Kindle.",
