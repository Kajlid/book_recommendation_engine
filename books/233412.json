Life, it seems, always has a new surprise in store and that's as true as ever for the Patterson family of For Better or For Worse. Lynn Johnston has been bringing life to the Patterson clan since 1979, and for readers around the world, life just wouldn't seem right without her daily dispatch. I've Got the One-More-Washload Blues give readers more of what they've come to expect from Johnston's beloved a sense of connection, a shared intimacy with a family as familiar as their own, and a front-row seat to the enduring, endearing comic saga called life.",
