  "description": "Berrigan is young, romantic, idealistic… and confused. But she is brashly daring—even for the militant seventies—in her exploration of her lesbian self. A freshman at Bingham College, Berrigan finds Linda… ambivalent Linda. And then there’s Syru—fiery feminist, raging woman warrior bent on revolution—who sweeps Berrigan into her orbit and teaches her painful lessons in courage and loss. As Berrigan ventures farther afield, she discovers the homophobia and tyranny of the business world. But she also finds the St. Louis bar scene with Mac Isdyche and Trucker the poet… And through it all there’s Evelyn, who offers a depth of friendship beyond any value. And finally there’s Corette, who brings the full meaning of love and anguish to Berrigan’s poetic heart…",
