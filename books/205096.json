Year 1895, Mr. Scaife, Professor of Natural Sciences, investigates a possible haunting in a creepy abandoned house on Elbert County, Georgia.Along with twenty (not so brave) men, Mr. Scaife stayed three nights at the spooky McCarthy's mansion, writing down his encounters with the Unexplained. The outcome of this \"peculiar adventure\" is like a brief (barely 25 pages), old fashioned paranormal reality show, terrifying yet hilarious.",
