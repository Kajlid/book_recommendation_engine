  "description": "RIBOT has established itself over the past 10 years as one of the most exciting literary and arts publications from around the world. In this appearance, the annual will address the problematic of leisure or idleness in our ravenously consumptive, multi-national society, as originally explored by Paul Lafargue's notorious 1883 essay from St. Pelagie prison. Contributors include Amiri Baraka, John Baldessari, Guy Bennett, Frank Chin, Jeff Clark, Norma Cole, Corrado Costa, Douglas Messerli, Dennis Phillips, Leslie Scalapino, and many others.",
