  "description": "The landing was unlike any they had ever made. But then they had never before seen a planet so strange as this one – with its wild seas, scarred plains, and rubbled cities. It looked as if it had been totally devastated by some type of nuclear destruction. And they were most curious – these aliens with their green-scaled faces and stubby tails – to explore this peculiar place where man had once existed – until their ship exploded and they were stranded with no means of survival and no hope of rescue. Unless their high priest – Ama of the Keelong – prayed to the higher power they had rebelled against. For this was a spiritual mission – and the Alcoran had lost their way.",
