  "description": "'This is the story of Bella, who woke up one morning and realized she'd had enough...'Dark, violent and brutally funny, Dirty Weekend was hugely controversial when first published in 1991. It went on to become a bestseller, was translated into thirteen languages and was made into a feature film.Extracts from This is a brave, brilliant and beautiful book. I wish I had written it - Julie BurchillAn act of writing that is avant-garde in the literal sense...a literary turning point - Naomi WolfSpare and stylish - Literary ReviewAs a piece of stylized thuggery -- mordant humour run riot -- the effect is stunning - Marie ClaireZahavi upset a lot of people when this book was published. Not surprisingly, really. You can't break taboos and expect people to like you for it . . . Her story is one of sexual violence, perversion and murder, but it is also terribly funny, with some marvellous dialogue - The Sunday TimesDon't come looking for Jane Austen, but if you can stand the ride you may enjoy Zahavi's free-skating wit on very thin ice - GQDeadpan in style, shocking in content. Every moral and emotional preconception is subjected to a literary assault and battery. The polished rhythms and frightening finesse of the prose leave you stunned - The Daily Telegraph",
