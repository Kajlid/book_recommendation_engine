  "description": "Zombies. Not fun. At all. Jake O'Connor can testify to that. In fact, the recently dead rising to consume the living pretty much puts a permanent damper on someone's social life. That is, unless your best friend is a lunatic, you know a buxom martial arts enthusiast who likes to hit the clubs on the weekends, and your landlord collects engines of destruction like some people collect postage stamps.“Keep Your Crowbar Handy...” drops the reader headlong into the frightening (but sometimes comical) world of a zombie apocalypse, literally with a bang.
