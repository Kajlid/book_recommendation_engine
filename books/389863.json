This spurred them to refine the methods to help people perform more creatively and effectively at work. The program is revealed in The Artists' Way at Work: a twelve-week encounter with your own ingenuity, struggles, strengths and dreams -- as well as the political guidance to enable you to get things done.Through powerful self-assessment exercises with intriguing titles such as \"Power Inside vs. Power Outside,\" \"Developing Creative Continuity,\" and \"Finding Your Truth,\" readers learn to release their creative spirit at work and tap reserves of energy, vision, and passion. The Artists' Way at Work will help you excel in your job, launch the business of your dreams, or find the career you love.

They have been rigorously tested among business audiences and will unleash a degree of satisfaction at work (and in life) you may never have believed possible.
