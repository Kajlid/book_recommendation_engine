  "title": "Tangled Roots: Dialogues exploring ecological justice, healing, and decolonization",
  "description": "Tangled Roots is a book of interviews examining important yet marginalized intersections of social and ecological issues. Bringing together some of the most powerful interviews from five years of Healing the Earth Radio, this book breaks down barriers between subcultures and social movements, and seeks to educate, engage, and inspire. Some of these interviews take a critical look at our world today – examining the ongoing legacy of colonialism in North America, the destructiveness of industrial civilization, the ecological impacts of agriculture and the telecommunications industry – others talk about healing emotional trauma, deconstructing conventional scientific paradigms, and repairing the earth, and still others urge us to take action to stop injustice and protect our earth before it’s too late. \"Here are well-crafted and interesting interviews that expand the conversation—some will make you uncomfortable, which is okay. You don't need to agree with everything, but you do need to know what people who aren't like you are thinking.\"--Bill McKibben, author of The End of Nature, Deep Economy, and Hope, Human and Wild",
