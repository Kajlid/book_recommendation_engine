  "description": "When my parents were banished from Wolf City before I was born, I thought there was no way I would ever live in a pack again. Cuffed, with my shifter magic bound, I was forced to go to school with witches in order to keep my true nature from coming out.Then I met him.Sawyer Hudson.The Alpha's son was visiting Delphi Witches' College and spotted me. He took one look at me, and an hour later, I was being pulled out of school, taken into Wolf City and leaving my parents and everything I knew behind.It's the Alpha's son's selection year, the year he must pick a mate, and every female aged 18-22 must be in attendance.I've landed myself in the middle of Werewolf Bachelor, and just when I think I've got a handle on things, Sawyer releases my cuffs, unbinds my magic, and sees what I really am.The problem is, I don't know what this creature is that I transform into. It's not an ordinary werewolf, that's for damn sure.",
