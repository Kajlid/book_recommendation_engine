  "description": "On a world so distant it will never be missed, so secret it will never be remembered... humanity struggles to survive. Snow Taggart is dying. An incurable illness slowly tears her apart from the inside, leaving her weak and brittle, so when her home is attacked and the only person she loves brutally killed, she knows she'll need some help to protect those still alive. But when she signs up as a pilot for the faction responsible, with the intent of stealing a mech and finding her way home, she finds herself dealing with a little more than she bargained for as she's saddled with an energetic and seemingly childlike gunner. Snow's first objective becomes to get rid of the walking liability... however, little does she know, this diminutive gunner will become far more than a burden to her, and the journey home will cost her far, far more than she was ever willing to pay... but perhaps there's still a little hope left to be found in the last days of a cold and hurt teenage girl.",
