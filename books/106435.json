  "description": "After his wife's death, engineer Dudley Redfern moves from Wisconsin to Sprite, Georgia, seeking to hide from his grief by burying himself in work. He soon comes to believe everyone is crazy in this tiny town, where Old Southern values are placed on odd pedestals and more than the usual spiritual awakenings take place. Little does he know that the quiet nights and work-filled days he expected will soon be interrupted when Spriteâ€™s prodigal son returns to run for high office, and he finds himself embroiled in an age-old scandal and searching for solutions to issues he has never faced before. Will this master problem solver be able to find an elegant solution that will protect the town, his reputation, and the mill he is hired to fix?",
