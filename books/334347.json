No one except him: the broody songwriter. The man with dark, hungry eyes who watches me from the shadows.My stalker.Everywhere I turn, I feel his gaze on me. When I walk down dark city streets, his footsteps echo behind. And when the tour ends and I go home… he follows.I should be scared. I should stay far, far away, and I definitely shouldn’t leave my bedroom window open to tempt him. So crazy.Obsession is a dangerous thing…But this man’s gaze sets me free.\nHis Muse is a short and steamy instalove story, starring an OBSESSED songwriter and the girl who revels in his love.",
