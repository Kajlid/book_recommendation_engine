But when they all blow off their SAT prep in favor of forming their own study group, they actually begin to bond -- over why there's so much competition over a stupid test. And what it really measures, anyway.Then it's revealed that someone has cheated on the SATs, and all eyes point to the study group. Everyone knows that Leo can't stand to lose. That Max is convinced he's a loser. That Jane couldn't care less about the whole thing. And that if Daisy doesn't clinch the right score, forget it -- she can't afford to go to college.The pressure is on for the cheater to come forward. Who will fess up?",
