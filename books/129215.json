  "description": "Elle A. Rose’s new book began life as a short story for a Halloween anthology published by her writing group. Having developed the story into a full length novel, Elle has now produced a full-length YA fantasy novel for her readers to enjoy. Frozen follows teenager Verick Cedar, who survives in a world ravaged by alien species the Xecerptavode. With the land ravaged, the water drained and all comforts a thing of the past, the humans are forced to venture out on Halloween, when the Xecerptavode are briefly frozen. Sixteen year old Verick must go ‘Trick or Treating’ for the first time, navigating the unforgiving environment and gathering supplies for his family in his one brief window of opportunity.Elle A. Rose deftly explores reactions to deprivation, disaster, and grief, and in doing so raises questions about the nature of humanity. As the fight for survival places ever-increasing pressure on Verick’s friends and family, ripples of anger and betrayal threaten to immobilise their society for good. Frozen will appeal to adult and young adult readers of sci-fi and fantasy, and Verick’s fear, desperation and, ultimately, courage and compassion will grip readers to the final pages.",
