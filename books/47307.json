  "description": "Alice Hughes lies on her bedroom floor, beaten and bleeding. Mostly though, she’s afraid. Afraid that the next time her husband hits her, he won’t stop until she’s dead.She has to get away. But where can she go? She needs somewhere to hide…When Alice finds the perfect hiding place, the one place her husband would never dream of looking for her, she thinks all her prayers have been answered. Here she can rest, recover, and when she’s stronger, she can make plans.But there is something she needs to remember. Something that happened long ago and is bleeding through into the present and threatening Alice's future. Even when the lovely, aptly named Hope comes into Alice's life, there is something dark reaching out from the shadows, its nightmare fingers grasping after her. Because what Alice doesn’t know, is that no hiding place is completely safe, and sometimes your worst enemies aren’t the ones you thought they were. After all, there’s no hiding from yourself.",
