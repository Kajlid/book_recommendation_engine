  "description": "A legacy that has touched audiences all over the world began in Dallas, Texas, in 1972 when Zig Ziglar recorded perhaps the definitive work of his career. Biscuits Fleas and Pump Handles is the compilation of observations, thoughts and research Zig had spent years preparing to present as the foundation of a philosophy born of hope and nurtured with integrity. In this 60 minute recording, Zig lays out a plan for living a balanced and fulfilling life, teaching us that we can have everything in life we want if we will just help enough other people get what they want. The applications outlined in this message have changed lives, built careers, and propelled individuals and institutions to unexpected heights. Used as the cornerstone for all training provided by Ziglar, this program is packed with answers to tough questions in turbulent times.",
