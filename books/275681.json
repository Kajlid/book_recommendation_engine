  "title": "The Great Challenge: The Myth of Laissez Faire in the Early Republic",
  "description": "The doctrine of laissez-faire, the imperative to \"let the people do as they choose,\" has long been identified as one of the ideological cornerstones in the foundation of the republic. The government which governs least, governs best has been the lesson taught to young students of American history and the motto of savvy politicians seeking to gain public favor with a seeming truism.Although the notion of laissez-faire's importance is undoubtedly honored by time, whether it is validated by experience is open to question. Some 45 years ago, Frank Bourgin, then a young graduate student at the University of Chicago, began to compile evidence which indicated that the concept of a non-interventionist government was not part of the founding fathers' program.Frank Bourgin was a pioneer in his field. He demonstrated that the early republic was created by men who envisioned an affirmative government, one which would devise systematic means of meeting social needs and developing a new nation's resources. They were men responding to the great challenge that was America and this is the story of that challenge.",
