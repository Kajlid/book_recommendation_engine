  "description": "It goes without saying that the times in which we live are precarious ones at best. The troubles of the world can overwhelm, confound, displace and stifle all that we have and all that we are. Very often, we need a reminder that there is a comfort in our times of sorrow; there is a reward for our troubles; there is a restful balm when we are too tired to keep going. The poems in this collection serve as ever-present reminders of God's love and care for us whatever we might be facing. This collection tells the reader of the great solace to be found in God's love. It provides a way for the reader to connect with his/her own soul in order to connect that same soul with the Almighty. Here, the reader is invited to step away from all that keeps us disconnected, to \"Slow down and walk with God so close/ To hear the whisperings of His sweet Soul\" These lovingly crafted poems highlight the themes of kindness, solace, love and inspiration. They are divinely inspired to offer the reader a slow, contemplative word in these fast times, a gentle reminder that the Spirit of Him is within us all if we simply ask for it.",
