  "description": "The Wind stirred up a fury among Texas readers when it was first published in 1925.This is the story of Letty, a delicate girl who is forced to move from lush Virginia to desolate West Texas. The numbing blizzards, the howling sand storms, and the loneliness of the prairie all combine to undo her nerves. But it is the wind itself, a demon personified, that eventually drives her over the brink of madness.While the West Texas Chamber of Commerce rose up in anger over this slander of their state, Dorothy Scarborough's depiction of the cattle country around Sweetwater during the drought of the late 1880s is essentially accurate. Her blend of realistic description, authentic folklore, and a tragic heroine, bound together by a supernatural theme, is unique in Southwestern literature. As a story by and about a woman, The Wind is a rarity in the early chronicles of the cattle industry. It is also one of the first novels to deal realistically with the more negative aspects of the West This edition is illustrated with stills from the 1928 MGM film The Wind, starring Lillian Gish.",
