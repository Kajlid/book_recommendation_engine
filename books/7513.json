And they shackled her to the wall of an abandoned mansion - within easy reach of her fellow prisoner.She knows he is a vampire. She knows that she's to be his dinner, and that when he is finished with her, she will be dead. Yet when dawn breaks, she is still alive. And now he needs her to help him survive the day.",
