  "description": "All of civilization is drawing its last breaths as the grip of the zombie apocalypse tightens on the world. In the last days of government efforts to stem the spreading plague, Lori’s parents are taken away when found to be infected - leaving her to look out for her two younger siblings, Jay and Virginia. Barely an adult in her own right, Lori must keep them alive, armed only with her wits and the little training her father’s \"prepper\" hobby instilled in her. They struggle not only to avoid the hoards of undead monsters roaming their former neighborhood and town, but also to stay sheltered, warm, and fed with resources scarce and sometimes deadly to retrieve. With the help of a fellow \"prepper,\" Bob, and his two playful yet fearsome dogs, they will face the roaming corpses of mindless zombies and an even more dangerous threat moving amongst them..”",
