  "description": "Recently Nominated for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, Night Talk has served as an inspiration for honest discussions of race around the country.A beautiful, moving story of the unlikely and enduring friendship of two girls, one white and one black, who grew up together in the radically divided deep South.At night, under the same roof, under the same moon, nothing divides the girls, Evie and Janey Louise. Talking on their beds, they discuss their strong mothers, their absent fathers, and they wonder about paths their lives will take. Yet during the day, Evie is blind to their differences-that she is white and her best friend is black. It is only as they grow older that Evie comes to see the inequalities that permeate their lives and to understand that for their friendship to continue she must recognize the different worlds they face.",
