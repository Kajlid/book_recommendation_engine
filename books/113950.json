  "description": "The magnificent history of Britain by the legendary statesman and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, now condensed in one volume.  A History of the English-Speaking Peoples stands as one of Winston S. Churchill's most extraordinary literary works. Begun during the “wilderness years” when he was out of government, first published in 1956 after his leadership through the darkest days of World War II had cemented his place in history, and completed when Churchill was in his eighties, it remains to this day a compelling and vivid account. This one-volume abridged edition of Churchill’s major work makes accessible to readers the full sweep of his magisterial chronicle.",
