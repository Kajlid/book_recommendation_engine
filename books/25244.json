  "description": "Twelve new amateur bakers are ready to rise to the Great British Bake Off challenge. While they don their aprons, adjust to their new ovens, and get used to baking in a tent, this book takes you through the challenges from the series and shows you how to achieve baking perfection. Throughout the book, Mary and Paul are on hand with expert advice and practical tips to help you create perfect cakes, biscuits, breads, pastries, pies, and teatime treats every time. Each chapter begins with a specific baking skill, which, once mastered, allows you to tackle Mary and Paul's technical challenges, as seen on the show, with confidence. There are over 120 recipes in this book, including traditional British bakes and imaginative twists using classic ingredients, as well as the best contestant recipes from the series. There is plenty to challenge keen bakers here, from brandy snaps to elaborate pastries, pavlovas to iced celebration cakes, and with a sensuous and yet practical design and full-color, step-by-step photography, this really will become the baking book that you will turn to for years to come. Includes metric measures and conversion chart.",
