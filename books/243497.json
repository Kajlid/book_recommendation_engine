  "title": "The Charles Bronson Book of Poems: Birdman Opens His Mind Bk. 1",
  "description": "A collection of poems and color illustrations from one of Britain's category 'A' prisoners, Charles Bronson, formerly Michael Peterson. The poetry indicts the anachronistic penal system for what Bronson says they did to him. This book's full of Bronson's coloured drawings and he doesn't hold back on them. More of an adult humour book than anything else so don't be fooled by the word 'poem'. You will get a laugh at this book chapter by chapter, as each chapter has a theme to follow to give you a good old laugh, you won't be disappointed.  A firm reference source for Bronson's earlier artwork.",
