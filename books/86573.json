  "title": "A Journey through Emotional Abuse: From Bondage to Freedom",
  "description": "One in four women will experience domestic abuse in her lifetime.Many Christians believe domestic abuse doesn’t occur in Christian homes.Sadly, “Religion is not a deterrent. There is just as much abuse in Christian homes as in non-Christian homes,” according to the Christian Coalition against Domestic Abuse. A Journey through Emotional Abuse answers the difficult “Am I being abused?” along with many theological questions such as, “Do I have to submit to this?” “Does God care about me?” and “Does the Bible say I can leave him?”Providing abused women with important information, in bite-size pieces, along with emotional support, this book walks readers through the Matthew 18 process of reconciling with a brother, allowing the church to intervene. Readers are given assistance with discerning whether their husband has made necessary changes or whether, for their own safety, they should leave him. For those who decide they must leave, A Journey through Emotional Abuse offers a plan for leaving safely and tips on how to prepare for consequences of their police, social services, and court intervention.Readers will move from feeling confused, frightened, and alone to feeling informed and peaceful. Equipped with the knowledge of where to find help, coupled with the fact that she is the daughter of the King of the Universe, His special treasure, readers will find hope.",
