  "title": "Fresh",
  "description": "FRESH is a collection of poetry created over a scant few months in late 2010. It moves in many different directions but manages to keep a consistent voice. It has an urgency, and haphazardness to it that celebrates growth, change, and looking forward while still not forgetting what has gone before. It proves that time spent in college can be good for more than binge drinking and sleeping â€˜til noon; learning can actually take place as well.",
