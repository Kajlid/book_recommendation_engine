  "title": "Postmemories of Terror: A New Generation Copes with the Legacy of the \"Dirty War\"",
  "description": "Postmemories of Terror focuses on how young Argentineans remember the traumatic events of the military dictatorship (1976-83). This work is based on oral histories with sixty-three young people who were too young to be directly victimized or politically active during this period. All were born during or after the terror and possessed an entirely mediated knowledge of it. Susana Kaiser explores how the post-dictatorship generation was reconstructing this past from three main inter-generational dialogue, education, and the communication media. These conversations discuss selected and recurrent themes like societal fears and silences, remembering and forgetting, historical explanations, and accountability. Together they contribute to our understanding of how communities deal with the legacy of terror.",
