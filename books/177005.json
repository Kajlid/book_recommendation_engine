  "title": "Dreams Rewritten",
  "description": "Dreams Rewritten is an eclectic collection of poetry written across the years from the perspective of a young college student, a husband and family man, and a mature and aging adult. Yates employs a range of poetic techniques from simple, descriptive poems to an experimental, highly creative voice. Author and historian, Dr. Rick Sherrod, describes Dreams Rewritten as \"delightfully, creatively, often touchingly autobiographical, and liberally seasoned with delightful sense of humor. Throughout the work, I marveled at Yates' vast grasp of science, nature, and history; insights into human, parent-child, and gender relationships; understanding and appreciation of anthropology, world religions, man's place in the universe, and the human condition in general. I especially appreciated those poems that reflected his awareness of the rapidly changing, technologically-oriented world, which slows down for no one as we enter our twilight years. 'Facebook' is a masterpiece!\"",
