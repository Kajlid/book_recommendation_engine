  "description": "What did your mama teach you about sex? Anything?Drawing from personal experience, interviews, research, and real-life teachings, Happy, Sexy, Shameless opens up a truly unprecedented and deeply meaningful discussion about female sexuality. This debut book from Shasta Townsend is told in a part confessional, part How-To, and part interview style. Shasta speaks in an original, and at times daring voice as she tackles many of the unspoken rules that keep us locked down as women. She confronts the so-called sacred cows of sexuality and sexually appropriate behavior with clarity, humor and grace that creates the space for great sex, wonderful connection, increased self love, and a plain out great life. This is unlike any self-help book or sex book you have read before!You will want to read it all at once!This book remedies the shame, conditioning, trauma and just plain confusion with an open, meaningful and at times raw discussion of sexuality just for women. Through personal stories, interviews with real women, and academic research thatâ€™s presented in an accessible way, this how-to guide to embracing sexuality as a gift takes an entirely new approach to female sexuality, and even makes it fun!Happy, Sexy, Shameless will be available through amazon.com and other retailers as of February 17, 2015. A portion of the sales of this book goes to organizations dedicated to stopping the sexual slavery of women and children. Learn more",
