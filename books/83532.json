  "description": "Meet the Bird FamilyAll four children have an idyllic childhood: a picture-book cottage in a country village, a warm, cosy kitchen filled with love and laughter, sun-drenched afternoons in a rambling garden.But one Easter weekend a tragedy strikes the Bird family that is so devastating that, almost imperceptibly, it begins to tear them apart.The years pass and the children become adults and begin to develop their own quite separate lives. Soon it's almost as though they've never been a family at all.Almost. But not quite.Because something has happened that will call them home, back to the house they grew up in - and to what really happened that Easter weekend all those years ago.",
