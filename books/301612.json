So when I saw Keller Cannon, drummer of LP-45, perform at a charity concert, I knew he’d be the perfect guy to have heaps of fun with.It was temporary. No strings attached. A pretty damn perfect arrangement if you ask me.Until it wasn’t. Until being with him highlighted just what I was missing.But having more wasn’t an option.He made that perfectly clear.KellerMusic is my escape. When I’m behind my drums, I’m granted temporary respite from my demons and a small reprieve I don’t deserve.Until Maddie.Maddie is a distraction I can’t afford and crave at the same time. I drown in her and she breathes life into me. She offers peace--the comfort and promise of a life free from the torment. But I don’t deserve her. And I can’t need her like I do.I just cant.",
