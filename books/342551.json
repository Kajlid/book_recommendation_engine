Argenti agent Darren Sumner was born to hunt and terminate rogue werewolves, and his assignment to target Aden Richter should have been like any other. Guilty of seven murders, the werewolf needed to be put down.  Unfortunately, Darren's assigned to infiltrate a Halloween party in a leather miniskirt, high heels, and a wig! To make things more difficult, once he comes in contact with Aden, the last thing he wants to do is kill him.  Distracted by lust neither can control, they stumble over a conspiracy that involves the darkest magic, betrayal, and murder. A conspiracy that binds Darren and Aden inextricably tighter as the danger moves closer...  Gay / Dark Fantasy / Werewolf / BDSM (Light) / Series",
