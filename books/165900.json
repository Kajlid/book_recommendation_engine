  "description": "Irresistible seduction only leads to...War had scarred the Earl of Ashby's face...and perhaps his soul. Before being wounded in the Napoleonic war and shunning society, the dashing lord had been a notorious rake. Now, Isabel Aubrey, a proper lady, dares to approach the masked, reclusive nobleman for a large donation to a worthy charity—and decides she must save him from his self-loathing. She begins to flirt. He responds. She invites him to a masquerade ball. He accepts and dazzles her with a kiss. The most scandalous passion...But Isabel already has a fiancé, and despite her attraction to the earl, she knows she must reject him. Yet no force on earth is greater than the passion that leads her into his bed; nothing she has ever experienced is more exciting and erotic. Now he asks her to stay with him although it will mean her ruin. Isabel must not say yes—and the smitten earl cannot let her say no. To win her body and her heart, he initiates an outrageous scheme that only a rake would devise—and no woman can resist.",
