  "title": "A Few Red Drops: The Chicago Race Riot of 1919",
  "description": "On a hot day in July 1919, three black youths went swimming in Lake Michigan, unintentionally floating close to the \"white\" beach. An angry white man began throwing stones at the boys, striking and killing one. Racial conflict on the beach erupted into days of urban violence that shook the city of Chicago to its foundations. This mesmerizing narrative draws on contemporary accounts as it traces the roots of the explosion that had been building for decades in race relations, politics, business, and clashes of culture. Archival photos and prints, source notes, bibliography, index.",
