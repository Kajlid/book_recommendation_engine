Sexy Successful Self-confident These are words that describe me today.  Looking in the mirror, I see a sexy, confident and successful woman reflected back at me. I’ve found a man that not only fulfills my carnal desires, but one who is quickly filling the empty space in my heart. With both Kyle and Shelby by my side, my life is nearly perfect.  Perfect until one of the biggest mistakes of my life strolls back into town, bringing with him all of the darkness from my past. I am Roni Monroe and this is my story.",
