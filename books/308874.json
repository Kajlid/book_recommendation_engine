  "description": "Winner: International Book Awards, Business, Communications/Public RelationsWinner: Axiom Awards, Business Technology (Silver) Microsoft Teams. Slack. Zoom. Google Workspace.Every day, hundreds of millions of people use these über-popular collaboration tools, but only in decidedly limited ways: as email and Skype replacements. Because these folks are merely scratching the surface of what these robust collaboration hubs can do, they fail to realize their massive benefits.Blame ignorance, not malice. With rare exception, organizations, executives, and rank-and-file employees have historically worked in piecemeal fashions. They have lacked a holistic framework to fully understand the remarkable power of these applications, much less unleash them.At least until now.Reimagining Collaboration—the eleventh book from award-winning author and world-renowned collaboration expert Phil Simon—provides this essential gestalt. Simon introduces a bold new model of work. Ideal for HR professionals, knowledge workers, executives, remote workers, and small business owners, this timely, ambitious, and provocative book offers concrete tips for companies and groups on how to transform the way they work by embracing hubs and spokes.",
