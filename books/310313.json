  "description": "My marriage started as a lie.But some lies are worth telling.My father’s dying wish was to walk me down the aisle, and I’d do anything for him. Even marry a man I don’t love.So when my fiance jilts me only days before the ceremony, I turn to my college friend, Oliver Parkerson, and convince him to marry me.My family hasn’t met either man, so I’m confident we can pull this off.But the feelings, our touches, the way my heart beats for him... none of it feels pretend. The way he holds me at night and carries me through loss tells me he’s not acting either.I didn't mean to fall for my fake husband, but real love was the one thing I couldn't predict.Except, nothing built on lies can last—I know that better than anyone. But the truth might tear us apart forever.",
