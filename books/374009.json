  "description": "LITTLE LULU'S PAL TUBBY VOLUME 1: THE CASTAWAY AND OTHER STORIES John Stanley (W/A) On sale Sept 1 FC, 224 page $15.99 TPB, 6' x 9' From the pages of Little Lulu comes Tubby! The comedic genius of John Stanley couldn't be contained by one series alone, so in 1952 Lulu's pal Tubby made his solo debut in his own hysterical comic. Filled with all the charm and hilarity of Little Lulu, Tubby is a familiar but different delight from comics legend John Stanley! Dark Horse is proud to present these never-before-reprinted gems from comics' golden age in a new series of paperback collections. Like Dark Horse's new Little Lulu series, Tubby is printed in full color, just as the comics appeared over fifty years ago! o Reprinting Marge's Tubby #1-#6 for the first time ever, in full color! o Published quarterly at first, Tubby included John Stanley's only published cartooning work of the 1950s. In fact, Stanley was inspired to draw issues #2-#9 in their entirety.",
