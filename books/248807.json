The only criteria for membership: they must be the best of the best!She’s damaged... Brooke Sullivan’s carefully ordered existence is spiraling out of control. A year ago, she was violently abducted by a terrorist group and nearly killed. She’s worked hard to get her life back on track—moving to a new house, changing careers, going on a couple of dates. When she witnesses a murder, she’s plunged into a new nightmare. And as the past threatens to repeat itself, she’s not sure she’ll survive this time.He’s ruthless... Cade “Saint” Rodgers never forgot the beautiful girl he talked to at the wedding of his commanding officer. Now she’s in trouble, and he’s the one tasked with protecting her. Brooke is terrified of men like him—a Black Ops soldier for whom violence is a way of life—which makes falling for her a terrible idea. But that won’t stop Cade from using every sensual trick he’s got to make her believe anything is possible if only she wants it badly enough. Together, they’re combustible... As danger draws closer, it’ll take all of Cade’s strength—and all of Brooke’s determination—to learn how to let go of the past and trust each other. But it might not be enough. To keep her safe, he may have to let her go forever.",
