I guess it's my own fault. That's what you get when you end up on the wrong side of a shadower vanquishing spell in front of a human and the High Coven decides to send you a message.Should I have known better? Yes. Would that have made a difference? Probably not. Somehow, I figure I always deserved to hide in plain sight in the midst of the people that want me dead.But Shadowhurst Academy isn't so bad, if you don't count the students that keep turning up dead. To make matters worse, all signs point to magic and we all know what that means - yours truly is in it deep.Between trying to blend in with the hunters, looking for a killer that doesn't want to be found, and keeping my magic under control, I've got my hands full. But hey, no one said being a witch would be easy!Welcome to Shadowhurst kids - the place where suburbia hides its secrets. Too bad the secret it's hiding is me.",
