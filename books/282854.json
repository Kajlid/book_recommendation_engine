Clarissa Milagres Silvera is a talented choreographer who understands the true value of freedom after her world is plunged into darkness. With a violent marriage behind her, that leaves her intensely mistrustful of men, she redefines life and her talent on her own terms.  Leon Rodriguez has never forgotten the stunningly beautiful Clary who could dance like the wild wind once upon a time. However, his proposal of marriage is rejected by Clary who suspects that Leon’s real motive is to acquire the prestigious Silvera property.  Even as Leon patiently woos his stoic love, he must protect her from the sadistic Igor Chekanov, a real estate shark who is stalking her.  Clary refuses to be subdued by any man; valiantly resisting her burgeoning attraction to Leon’s potent charisma, as well as fighting Chekanov’s insidious trap.  Stuck between the two powerful men, her safety is dependent on the best available option. She must marry Leon to escape Chekanov’s ever-increasing threat to her life.  Just when Clary’s growing love for Leon lulls her into a sense of security, Chekanov draws her into a dangerous game of survival where she must outwit the enemy alone.  Will Clary’s handicap become her weakness? Or, will she be able to overcome her biggest fear and win a battle that could very well be her last?",
