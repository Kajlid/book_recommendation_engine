Rebel Cumas wanted to use their powers to achieve their goals at any cost. And then, the unthinkable—Apollo’s son, Retaal was captured by the humans.Jacinta, a young and immortal witch, Apollo’s ward, was sent in to team up with a supernatural and rescue all the Gods, demigods and supernaturals being tortured and held in the prison known as the Lower Planet.And so it starts.",
