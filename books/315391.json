  "description": "I left Dogwood Cove as a child eighteen years ago when Ethan Monroe was nothing more than my best friend’s older brother. Now I’m back and he’s so much more.Gone is the boy I played hide and seek with, and in his place is the seriously hot, plaid-wearing, scruff-bearing, mayor of the small town we grew up in.I’ve got trust issues that can’t be fixed easily and I didn’t come back here looking for love, but Ethan is determined to prove that coming home could be the start of the life I’ve always dreamed of.Could he be the man to put my damaged heart back together for good? Always and Forever is perfect for fans of steamy small town romance, found family friend groups, cinnamon roll heroes, plenty of swoon, light hearted banter, quirky small town vibes, low angst and high heat love stories with a guaranteed HEA. It is a standalone, and the first full length novel in the Dogwood Cove series.",
