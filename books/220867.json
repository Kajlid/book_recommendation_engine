There are situations where villains disguise themselves as innocent individuals to take advantage of the unsuspecting nature of credulous people. Advocate Sukumar frequently quotes from Hitopadesh to emphasize the importance of being careful to avoid being deceived by the wolves in sheep’s clothing. Will he be able to swing a verdict in Amrit’s favor?The novel also raises an important issue on the accountability of the police. Are honest police officers justified in overstepping the boundaries of the law for good reasons?",
