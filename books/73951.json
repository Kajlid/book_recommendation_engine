  "description": "(originally published as Desire's Slave)Impetuous, impulsive New Orleans belle Genevieve Marie du Prés is accustomed to getting what she wants, and she doesn't hesitate to go after it, even if that means taking a wagon train to California to retrieve her errant fiancé. She never expects he might have other plans for her.Rio Jackson is very good at guiding eager emigrants across the prairies and mountains to the goldfields, but he's certainly not the type of man to appeal to a sophisticated lady. At least not until he's the only one who can rescue her from the trouble she's gotten herself into. When fate throws them together, they will have to rely on each other to survive in a wilderness full of dangers, not the least of which is a desire neither of them can deny.",
