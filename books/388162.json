  "description": "Book twenty-one in the Cattle Valley Series As one of the premier dancers in the hottest all male strip show in Vegas, William 'Moby' Haines had it all, men, money and freedom. When he was called home to Sheridan, Wyoming to care for his ailing mother, Moby's life drastically changed. Gone were the nights of screaming fans and eager to please one night stands. His life became a series of low-paying jobs and escalating medical bills. Moby's luck turned the day he read an ad in the morning paper for a waiter and barback at O'Brien's Pub. Although a forty-five minute commute to Cattle Valley would mean spending less time with his mother, Moby decided it was his one and only shot at a tolerable life in Wyoming. Burned once by the love bug, Sean O'Brien had no interest in traveling down that road anytime soon. Although the customers seemed to love his newest hire, Sean was quickly on the verge of firing the sexy stud. The way Moby allowed customers to treat him was disrespectful. If his newest hire wouldn't do anything about it Sean would, even if that meant claiming Moby for himself.",
