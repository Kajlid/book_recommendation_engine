Eric is the new Chouteau County prosecutor on his way to the White House.Four hours apart and each tied to their own careers, their worlds have no reason to intersect until a funeral brings Vanessa back to Chouteau County, back to face the man for whom she’d risked so much, the only man she ever wanted--the only man she can’t have.",
