  "description": "Part 2 in the highly anticipated Dark Romance Series#1 International Amazon Bestseller & #1 New ReleaseDon’t take what isn’t yours.Unless you’re willing to fight for it.I survived my depraved master, Maksim. Now, I belong to Charlie Decena, by nature and by nurture. He broke everything I believed in. My life still lingers in the gray zone — dark and light, love and hate, betrayal and murder. I’m battling Maksim’s brutal conditioning to uncover who Blaire is, for Charlie. I adhere to his counsel, indulge in his debauched desires, and pacify his dominance — until he pushes me too far.I hope I didn’t completely shatter your heart in the beginning of my story because it’s just getting started. I’m being tested beyond my limit by a lurking threat who has taken something very dear to me. And if they don’t return what isn’t theirs, someone is going to die.",
