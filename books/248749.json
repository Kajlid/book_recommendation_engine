Nothing will stop Asher when it comes to helping people find their true love.He’s absolutely positive everything will work out in the end.Because love is always like a fairy tale…right?* * *The main romance arc spans across all three novellas. When Red Cried Wolf contains little romance but sets up for the rest of the series.—When Red Cried Wolf is a slow-burn romance with over-the-top characters, fairy tale references, ridiculous texts, and eventually, a happy ever after.",
