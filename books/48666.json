  "description": "I did not move. I am not skittish by nature, but I know the sound of a hammer being cocked when I hear it. This one was a large calibre automatic, which meant it wasn’t a cop. I turned my head as slowly and non-threateningly as I could. It was my friend with the square jaw, and his friend the .45. “Hi,” he said.It was a simple enough case, but don't they always start out that way? When a pair of His and Hers private detectives get involved, the sparks start to fly and the blood begins to spill in earnest. With every shot that’s fired, the hole digs a little deeper, and the list of people our sparring shamuses can trust gets shorter and shorter.Fans of Decoder Ring Theatre’s long-running full-cast audio series Black Jack Justice will delight in the very first meeting between Jack Justice and Trixie Dixon, girl detective. New readers will appreciate the fast tempo, the noir banter and the classic hard-boiled feel of Black Jack Justice !",
