  "description": "Though he posed as a gay hooker, Daniel had never been with a man and only mildly curious. As a cop, he has seen it all, until he touched the stranger, experienced a rush of arousal no man had ever caused, looked into the pale blue, ice cold eyes, and recognized a predator. He thought of him when the first murdered pimp showed up and his young boy prostitute disappeared. The possibility didn’t stop him from giving into an urge he didn’t understand and saying yes the next time he saw him.Brand had no intention of ever getting involved, woman or man, human or wolf. He didn’t know how to love, only to kill. His plan was to experience sex once with a man and walk away. His wolf wouldn’t let him, not when his wolf was the only thing that could save Daniel’s life.",
