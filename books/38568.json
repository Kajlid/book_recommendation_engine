  "description": "As it journeys through the author’s life, this collection by Anglo-Iranian poet Mimi Khalvati explores childhood, motherhood, loss, eroticism, and the natural world. Lyrical and resonant, this compilation—haunted by the child-self that is never quite left behind—combines some essential selections of Khalvati’s previous work with new poems. The poems feature traditional forms as well as experiments with the Ghazal, an ancient Persian form comprised of an unrhymed couplet.",
