  "description": "Episode Two… Jean-Luc’s hotel has been blown up, his friend is dead and he is under investigation by Paradise Lot’s police chief, the archangel Michael. And his day hasn’t even started yet... Hellelujah!.. The gods are gone. All of them. Their last message to humanity was: \"Thank you for believing in us, but it is not enough. We're leaving. Good luck.\" At first no one took them seriously. Until, that is, all the denizens of all the heavens and hells started showing up on people's doorsteps. Creatures that were once thought of as myth are now refugees striving to adapt to life on earth. Trouble is, after eons of living forever, they're not very good at being mortal. Caught in the middle is Jean-Luc, a struggling hotelier who (reluctantly) promised to help these 'Others' live in this new GoneGod world. But taking care of his guests, keeping his hotel afloat and dealing with the constant drama of the Others' lives is figuratively killing him. And now that an unusually strange Other is in town, his figurative demise might soon become more literal.",
