  "description": "The cave was low and narrow, forcing Yuri to bend down and squeeze himself between the rocks. He hoped that the bear would be too large to reach him. He heard the bear’s bellows from outside. Yuri tried his best to focus on moving forwards.The cave was dark and dry. The tunnel continued to shrink in size. Yuri eventually had to get on his knees and crawl. He sighed with relief. The bear couldn’t possibly get to him here.Then he realized he couldn't turn around.Panic set in again. What if he got stuck here? He didn’t have his cell phone, and he hadn’t told anyone he was going to the reserve today. Would he starve here? Would he have to gnaw his arm off or something to escape?Luckily, up ahead, a circle of light appeared. There was an exit.He still had to crawl, but the fear that he would get stuck began to lessen. The light grew brighter and brighter, until he was just at the opening. He grabbed the rocks at the entrance, and pulled himself out.“Where am I,” Yuri murmured, taking a few steps forward.He turned back to make sure the bear had not followed him, then gasped. The cave entrance was gone.Yuri’s vision went black as something hard hit him on the back of his head.Meet the monsters in an Unknown World. Don’t worry, they don’t bite. Too hard.",
