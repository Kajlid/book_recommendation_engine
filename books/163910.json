  "description": "There are things that exist that cannot be explained or comprehended. Creatures so terrifying that the human mind refuses to believe the possibility of existence. Romanticism of evil can only get you so far—dead.The stories are there throughout history. The proof is not. At least…until now.We’re here, moving amongst the shadows. Living beneath the homes and streets you believe are safe. You are not safe. You never were. All the times you looked over your shoulder because you felt you were being watched—hunted—you were.I am Marko Delacroix and I am not redeemable. None of us are. I am a Master Vampire and the worst kind of man there is alive or dead. I will make you fear me, want me, and then then I will kill you. It is the nature of who we are. Of the game. And yes, to us, this IS a game.Man versus the undead. The undead versus ourselves.In a new world of change and acceptance, no one is safe. But they don’t know that yet.**WARNING** This book/series is DARK. If you're looking for a happily ever after from the first book, this book is NOT for you. Although there are romantic elements building for further into the series, you will not be swept off your feet by the last sentence. You will most likely be left open-mouthed, cursing me to hell and back.**WARNING #2: This book contains adult content, very graphic violence, disturbing situations, and very strong language. Intended for mature audiences.",
