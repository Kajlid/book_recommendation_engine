  "description": "He sacrificed everything for me. The beast who took me against my will and tied my soul to his so tightly I can no longer breathe without him. He sacrificed his freedom. His life. For me. They say love will make you do anything, give anything. But what’s between him and I - it isn’t love. It’s a bond. And my destruction.  Torment is the third book in Nora Ash’s suspense-filled Omegaverse serial, Feral. Please note: This series gets dark, and it gets dirty. If you don’t enjoy your romance scorching and your alphas rough & dominant, give this book a pass.",
