  "description": "Raven's back. From best selling authors Caroline Dries and Steve Seca comes the scorching sequel to Diva Las Vegas.   When a heartthrob lounge singer gets passed over for a big promotion, who does he call for help? Raven McShane, the most unconventional detective in Las Vegas. When Raven isn't working the pole at her gentlemen's club, she's stirring up a hornet's nest of trouble as a private detective, but this time she might be in over her head. When her investigation turns bloody, she enlists outside muscle (who just happen to be drop-dead sexy) to help her navigate Nevada's seamy underside and help her client beat a murder charge. Intrigue, betrayal, and colossally bad luck challenge Raven's spirits, but she charges ahead with her chin up and her heels poised to do maximum damage.",
