Until he meets the enigmatic “Miss Ophelia Cummings” who is only in Town for three days. Their paths serendipitously cross twice, and Thomas is drawn to her like no one before. Fate deals a cruel blow on the third day when the chance to see the delightful Miss Cummings is thwarted by mere moments. Thomas will do whatever it takes to discover if what he feels for her is real, but it may be too late. This edition is the combined story of Love Finds Lord Davingdale and A Husband for Miss Trent.",
