But Charlie already lost everything once by giving in to his fear, and he's not willing to make the same mistake again. If he’s going to do this, Charlie knows he can’t hold back. He can't date this man a little, he can't trust him a little, he can't go to bed with him a little. If he's going to get involved with Dante Dombruso, Charlie has to be All In.Please note: This book is a lighthearted m/m romance. It contains explicit language, just a bit of BDSM to spice things up, and plenty of steamy sex between two hot guys. ADULT CONTENT.",
