  "description": "Includes the novels Dirty Sweet , Everybody Knows this is Nowhere , and Swap Road rage or a premeditated killing? Dirty Sweet is a fast - paced crime story that follows each character to a surprising end. In Everybody Knows this is Nowhere , detective Gord Bergeron has problems. Maybe it's his new partner, Ojibwa native Detective Armstrong. Or maybe it's the missing ten - year - old girl, or the unidentified torso dumped in an alley behind a motel, or what looks like corruption deep within the police force. In Swap , Toronto's shadow city sprawls outwards, a grasping and vicious economy of drugs, guns, sex, and gold bullion. And that shadow city feels just like home for Get - a Detroit boy, project - raised, ex - army, Iraq and Afghanistan, only signed up for the business opportunities, plenty of them over there. Now he's back, and he's been sent up here by his family to sell guns to Toronto's fast - rising biker gangs. This edition is in two volumes. The second volume ISBN is 9781459650466.",
