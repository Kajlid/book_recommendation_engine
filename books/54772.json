  "title": "Messed Up Like You: How ADHD and anxiety didn't stop me from becoming a successful entrepreneur",
  "description": "Culleton’s story of repeated triumph over adversity will inspire you to overcome the negatives in your life.Rick Culleton is hardly the kind of person you’d expect to fly an airplane. He is fearful of heights and lacks a good sense of orientation. None of this, however, has prevented him from earning a pilot’s license. Nor have anxiety and ADHD and people labeling him a lost cause stopped him from becoming highly successful as an entrepreneur.Growing up, the author struggled in school because of learning difficulties. He showed no athletic talent, did a brief stint in prison at seventeen, and spiraled into debt in his twenties hustling used cars in Texas. Finally, with encouragement from a friend, he turned his life around and built an Inc. 5000 company selling discount electronics. Having weathered a major lawsuit brought against him and an IRS audit where incarceration seemed inevitable, he owns a real estate company in Austin and hotels in Jacó, Costa Rica, has won trophies and awards as an amateur athlete, and earned a pilot’s license.Messed Up Like You is a compelling narrative. Weaving together harrowing anecdotes from flight school and from the author’s business ventures, it will propel you toward becoming your best self and prompt you to take action.",
