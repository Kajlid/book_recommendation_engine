Now, tormented by an ancient ritual and a creature that shouldn't exist, she's about to encounter far worse things.Forty-one years ago, Doctor Eva Hamilton, principal of Our Immaculate Academy, became consumed by a little boy who promised her paradise. Tonight, she'll spill as much blood as it takes to make sure his vision is realised.\"",
