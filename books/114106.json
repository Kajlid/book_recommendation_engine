  "title": "Sorcerers' Dialogues: A Further Correspondence Between the Silver Elves and the Founders of the Elf Queen's Daughters",
  "description": "\"Sorcerers' Dialogues\" is a collection of letters that are a continuation of a correspondence started in our book \"Magic Talks\" between the Silver Elves and two sisters, Arwen and Elanor, who founded the Elf Queen's Daughters, of which the Silver Elves were a part. The Elf Queen's Daughters were a magical Frasority (fraternity/sorority) who were active in the mid 1970's and published three letters a week on Elven Culture, Philosophy and Magic that were sent to hundreds of individuals in the U.S. and Europe. This set of letters is entitled \"Sorcerers' Dialogues\" since the emphasis is primarily on Sorcery, but also includes, as the first book did, conversations about Esoteric Buddhism; the Ancient Wisdom Traditions; Tolkien's works and other author's of Faery Tales, modern and old; Magic; Mysticism; Elven and modern culture, and much more. You do not need to read the first book to enjoy this one; but as we say, these letters are a continuation from the ones in that book.",
