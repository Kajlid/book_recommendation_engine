  "title": "If He Hollers Let Him Go",
  "description": "This story of a man living every day in fear of his life for simply being black is as powerful today as it was when it was first published in 1947. The novel takes place in the space of four days in the life of Bob Jones, a black man who is constantly plagued by the effects of racism. Living in a society that is drenched in race consciousness has no doubt taken a toll on the way Jones behaves, thinks, and feels, especially when, at the end of his story, he is accused of a brutal crime he did not commit. \"One of the most important American writers of the twentieth century ... [a] quirky American genius...\"—Walter Mosley, author of Bad Boy Brawly Brown, Devil in a Blue Dress \"If He Hollers is an austere and concentrated study of black experience, set in southern California in the early forties.\"—Independent Publisher",
