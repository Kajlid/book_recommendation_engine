  "description": "Winner of multiple awards, praised by librarians and teachers as one of the best books ever written for teens―NOW BACK IN PRINT! New town, new school, new friends. It was difficult for Ginny at first, but her senior year is finally starting to feel kind of normal. That is, until she sees him―the beautiful mystery in her English class. He has never spoken a word to anyone. He moves through each day at school without making eye contact. His name is Smitty Tibbs, but everyone calls him the Alien. Ginny is convinced there's more to the Alien than his muted exterior. But as she attempts to break into his safe and emotionless world, she realizes her efforts might be causing more harm than good. Has she gone too far, or not far enough? \"Utterly compelling…totally satisfying. A fast-moving, unusual contemporary romance that should have great appeal.\" School Library Journal \"The thick wall an abused teenager builds between himself and the world is penetrated at last by an extraordinary pair of friends… A strong book with healing at the end, memorable for its spirited friendships and unpreachy soul-searching.\" Kirkus Reviews \"Ginny's deft and engaging narration reveals a delightful and totally believable teen. [T]he overall impact of this psychological novel is so powerful.\" Booklist",
