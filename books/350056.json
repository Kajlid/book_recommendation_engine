  "description": "The Road to Forever is a fast paced thriller about a hitchhiker serial killer and the two detectives that are hunting him down. Detective Simeon Jackson is a veteran police officer with a history of catching the worst criminals a big city has to offer. Through intelligence, experience and hard work, he has developed the ability to see a crime unfold before his mind's eye by merely studying the scene where it took place. However, with a dark and violent past that nearly cost him a big case, his badge and his self respect, something had to change. What followed shook him to his very soul and changed him forever. The Road to Forever also delves deep into the mind of a serial killer and explores what it takes to lead a man to willingly take the life of another human being. The reader sees the story from both sides, with fast paced action and psychological twists. In the end, it is a story of faith, human growth and triumph over the evil too prevalent in today's world.",
