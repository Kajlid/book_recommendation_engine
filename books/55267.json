  "title": "Blasted",
  "description": "Blasted is Sarah Kane's first full-length play which opened in 1995 at the Royal Court Theatre in London. and was the sensation of that year's theatre season, making front-page headlines and outraging some critics who thought her premise that there was a connection between a rape in a Leeds hotel room and the hellish devastation of civil war was simply an attempt to shock audiences. The questions raised in this play about violence are at the heart of Kane's writing.",
