  "description": "Can Lois Lane open herself up to friendship, romance, and being vulnerable in order to get the future that's right for her?  She might have to change her entire life plan to find out.Ambitious small town girl Lois Lane tackles a summer in the big city with gusto, but a cavalcade of setbacks—including an annoying frenemy roommate, a beyond tedious internship at a suddenly corporatized website, and a boss who demotes her to coffee-fetching minion—threatens to derail her extremely detailed life plan. And, you know, her entire future. When Lois uncovers a potentially explosive scandal, she must team up with the last person she’d expect to publish her own website for young women. And as Lois discovers who she really is and what she actually wants, she becomes embroiled in her own scandal that could destroy everything she's worked so hard to create. From beloved author, Sarah Kuhn ( Shadow of the Batgirl , Heroine Complex ), and with expressive and lively art by Arielle Jovellanos , comes a charming YA story about the strength it takes to embrace the messiness of life.",
