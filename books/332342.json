But her blissful new relationship comes with a catch.His name is Emery, my new stepbrother, and he’s the most infuriating, impulsive, chaotic, and strangely intriguing man I’ve ever met.I’ve managed to avoid him for a year but then on our way to our parents’ cabin, we get lost alone in the snowy mountains of Utah.That’s when pretenses and boundaries between us start to slip and fall away as we focus on survival. I begin to see the charming and sweet man he is. And maybe all the wild and ridiculous things about him that used to irritate me, are what make him truly perfect.Emery is a sweet, emotional, and hilariously funny MM romance that features forbidden love, forced proximity, hurt/comfort, and a HEA. It is the third standalone in the Unexpected series.",
