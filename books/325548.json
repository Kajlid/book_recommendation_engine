  "title": "Another View of Stalin",
  "description": "When the reader finishes reading this book, he will probably say: 'Many things I thought I knew regarding Stalin are indeed lies.'Another View of Stalin analyzes a series of 'media lies': the famine-holocaust in the Ukraine, the 12 million victims of the Gulag. The book refutes the classical attacks against Stalin: Lenin's testament, the collectivization imposed by a totalitarian party, the forced industrialization, the liquidation of the old Bolsheviks, the blind and absurd terror of the purges, the cooperation between Stalin and Hitler, etc...In Another View of Stalin, the reader will find an enormous quantity of information from Western academic sources that has long remained unknown to a wider public.",
