  "description": "Summer Quinn’s life changed five years ago when she walked in on her boyfriend and her best friend in bed together. She silently left, ghosting both of them, and never looked back. She came to Bitterroot Valley, looking for a fresh start, and that’s exactly what she got. After purchasing the local floral shop from her eccentric aunt and finding herself again in the absolute delight she brought to the community, Summer feels welcome and safe in her new home. But things have started to happen. At first, she could blow it off as bad luck, or kids starting trouble. But then the bad luck turns into serious, life-threatening incidents that can’t be ignored. Bitterroot Valley is Chase Wild’s town. His family settled the area almost a hundred and fifty years ago, and as a police officer, Chase takes pride in keeping his community safe. Sure, he’s had his eye on the gorgeous florist since she moved to town, but he’s kept his relationship with her strictly professional. Now, someone’s trying to scare Summer. She claims she doesn’t know why, but Chase is determined to get to the bottom of it and drive the danger out of his town. As time passes, and the more he gets to know Summer, the harder it is to keep his hands off of the beautiful woman. With their connection growing, he’s falling in love with her and will do anything to keep her safe. As Chase learns the truth of who is threatening Summer, will he be able to protect her, and will their love withstand the challenges ahead?",
