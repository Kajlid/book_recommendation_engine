  "description": "Jordan Cross left town with hellfire hot on her heels when her magic backfired. Now she’s returned to Holiday, Montana to find that not much has changed—except everything she hadn’t wanted to leave behind. Matt Cooper isn’t pleased to see Jordan back in town. Not only did she break his heart when she left, he’s been keeping secrets from his family and friends and he knows the moment he’s left alone with his ex, he won’t be able to keep them in anymore. Only one look and he knows he’s lost. Again. But magic has a way of turning on a dime and if they’re not careful, they might lose everyone once more—even before they have a chance to make it theirs.",
