  "description": "Nick Daly, a U.S. Army photographer invalided home from military operations in North Africa, receives a new assignment: document a secret project known as ‘Project Y’ in the New Mexico high desert. On the way, he meets up with one of the project scientists, Ian Pennington, a chemist with all the social grace and charm of a brick wall.  As Nick slowly delves into the world of Project Y, he discovers not only the staggering truth about its purpose, but also finds himself drawn to Ian, who’s far more intriguing than Nick had first imagined. As they form a tentative relationship, however, there are enemies in the background willing to use any means necessary to put a stop to the Allies’ secret project. Nick and Ian find themselves enmeshed in a plot that could mean the end of the war, with victory awarded to the wrong side.",
