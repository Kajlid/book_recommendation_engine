  "title": "The Wyrm Conspiracy",
  "description": "An all-action fantasy thriller for younger teenagers. Emily and Sam are plunged into a nightmare of monsters, conspiracy and betrayal that could lead to the end of everything they know. Can they solve the clues hidden in relics of the past and stop the terrifying Old King Coel from returning to devastate their home town? Can they even escape from the legions of possessed Wardens chasing them? And is Emily's dad really in league with the enemy?\"In a word, this book is brilliant. I was gripped from the beginning. It's easy to follow, the imagery is vivid, but it is full of twists and turns and is entirely captivating. It's a rip-roaring, non-stop adventure, and the reader is carried from one crisis to the next, and I would love to see this as a film.\" - The Kitchen WitchCOMING SOON: the second Wormwell book - WYRM GOLD!",
