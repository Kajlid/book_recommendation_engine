  "description": "Based on the Nebula Awardâ€“winning novellaThe morning after Neil Armstrong's funeral, a ghostly Saturn V rocket launches from Cape Canaveral. It shakes the ground and rumbles with all the fury of a real launch, sending back telemetry all the way to the moon, stopping at the point where a human would have to take control to land. NASA is shocked when this ghost launch becomes a monthly experience. When humanity loses interest, the rocket becomes near invisible. When we pay attention, Jerry Oltion's expanded Nebula Award-winning novella shows us that reality is what we make of it.",
