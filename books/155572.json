  "description": "ASIN moved from less recent editionThe squid of the planet Steranko have a problem. Their king is a lunatic, the last of their once-proud space fleet has been reduced to a theme restaurant, and the population's only ambition is to catch all of their soaps. So when a mineral shortage triggers a planetwide crisis, it's time to go where no squid has gone before: out of their comfort zone.Light-years away, the people of Earth aren't doing too well, either. The cavemen there are in constant danger of becoming extinct, whether it's from the elements, oversized predators or their own poor table manners. Anyone with half a brain would want to get out of town. Butthere's only one person on the planet who meets that requirement. He's Cro, the first Cro-Magnon man in a world of Neanderthals, and he's about to meet an alien race that's truly ahead of their time.Will Cro sell out his people for the sake of a good conversation? Does brains versus brawn really matter at the wrong end of a club? And how does an alien from another galaxy get an Irish accent? It's ET vs BC in a comic culture clash!",
