  "description": "Note: Alternate/new cover edition for ASIN# B00ECLPG98'No' is clearly not something the brilliant, rich and downright stunning, Ashton Drake, is used to hearing...and is even less willing to accept.When fresh out of college, Maya Caldwell, lands a job at the newspaper of her dreams, she couldn't be more excited for her first day. That is, until she gets an assignment.Interview a chess player...yeah, that's what she thought, too.When the two meet, two very different worlds collide in a tangled web of raw, primal, up-against-the-wall sex, absolute obsession and a complete disregard for the rules.Is she willing to sacrifice so much of herself to be what he wants...or is what he wants something entirely different than what he'd thought all along.Note: This book is part one of a trilogy, yet it is written to stand alone.",
