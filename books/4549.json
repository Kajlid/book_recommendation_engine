  "description": "Peter and Rina's newborn baby girl is a dream come true, but the scene at the L.A. hospital is a nightmare. Budget cutbacks and staff shortages so compromise security that Peter, the ever-anxious cop, worries about his family's safety. Then a baby is kidnapped and a respected nurse vanishes along with her. Peter, his tough-talking partner Marge, and Peter's eager older daughter Cindy, pursue a twisted path of hospital politics, misplaced passions and tortuous mind games of guilt and redemption that bring them face-to-face with the most grievous sin . . .",
