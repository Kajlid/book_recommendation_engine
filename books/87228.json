As soon as I stop and admire, Edmund promptly comes to my side and rubs against me. Do you ever wonder if there is more to your pet's behavior than meets the eye? Sometimes their antics are more than just random behavior. Can we learn something about ourselves by watching them? I believe so and Climb that Fence take that Leap is a compilation of personal, inspirational animal stories and the life lessons we can glean from them.
