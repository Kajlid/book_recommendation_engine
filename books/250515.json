But Slater, a former Texas Ranger with a restless spirit, is surprised to find himself on the wrong side of the law - and even more shocked to realise it's a she who is arresting him!Yet despite his rocky start in Shotgun, Slater find himself drawn to the close-knit town, to its strong church family, and especially to the fascinating Deputy Drake. As his heart grows more tender toward Liberty, Slater longs to see her turn in her gun and badge. Can Liberty, realising her awakening feelings for the rugged cowboy, give up her position when so many townspeople have come to rely on her? As Slater and Liberty struggle to understand their own feelings and find common ground in their beliefs, God's hand gently guides the way in this unpredictable heartwarming romance.",
