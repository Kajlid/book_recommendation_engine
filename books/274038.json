  "description": "Hopefully the death of his wolf will give Timothy the life he's always wanted.  Timothy has spent his entire life being told he isn’t strong enough. In a desperate, last-ditch effort to earn his father’s approval, the young omega enlists in a training camp for the special wolf forces branch of the military. But when everything goes wrong, Timothy decides it might be time to cut ties with his wolf side forever.  Christopher has spent his entire life trying to prove he’s the strongest. He’s worked hard to rise through the ranks of the military, building walls around himself to make him untouchable. All he wants is to protect those he cares about and lead a pack as a strong alpha. The special wolf forces seems like the perfect opportunity to do that.  Four years ago, Timothy and Christopher’s worlds collided, and one night changed the course of their lives forever. Brought together and broken apart, their paths cross again four years later. Full of guilt, hurt, and with misunderstanding thick between them, their reunion isn’t an easy one. Timothy never intended to see Christopher again, and while Christopher is ecstatic to be reunited, there’s just one problem; Timothy is pregnant and has no idea who the father is.
