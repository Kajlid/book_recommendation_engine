  "description": "Board shorts is a classic collection of briefings for aspiring or experienced company directors. Each section should be consistently entertaining and educational simultaneously for the reader.This book is a fitting way to mark several years of governance experience through another lense and allows the reader to flip through the book at leisure.These briefings cover most areas of interest for people in corporate governance and provides a global perspective. Board shorts was conceived by myself over the past couple of years through many requests from readers to have all my articles in one collection. Bearing in mind I have written over 100 articles, it was a challenge to select these 28 classic briefings for you, the reader.Boards Shorts offers insights on effective governance for aspiring and experienced directors. Henri gives his perspectives on a range of topics from establishing a board of directors for the first time to review the boards performance.",
