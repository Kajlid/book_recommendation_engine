  "description": "The newspapers call him the Blue Valley Killer. I call him my own personal nightmare.He takes his victims right under our noses, blinking them out of existence as they're walking down the sidewalk or getting the mail. Then they're found dead a couple of weeks later. He doesn't kill them right away. Sick bastard. He's killed four girls in the last 18 months: two college co-eds and two high-school students. He just keeps coming back for more.At 17 and living in the center of the Valley, I'm smack dab in the middle of this psycho's demographic.At this point, it's hard to believe he can snag another victim. Every girl I know between the ages of 12 and 20 goes nowhere without at least three friends and a six-pack of mace. Every parent in four counties has their daughters on 24/7 lockdown.Even the college campuses -- of which there are two in the dead zone -- are like ghost towns after dusk. Free rides by crisis counselors, escorts from frat guys doing community service -- no girl has to walk alone after dark in the Valley.How much does it suck to have a serial killer named after your pretty little slice of New England countryside? Evidently a lot, since they're thinking about changing our name after they catch the guy. No one wants to buy Blue Valley t-shirts or Blue Valley keychains when they conjure up CSI morgue footage instead of fall foliage. Well, nobody you'd want to babysit your kids.I'm not the sort of girl who jumps every time a door squeaks. I don't think the boogeyman lives under my bed, and the monsters in my closet don't scare me. I think of teen slasher flicks as comedies.So you tell me: Why is it that every time this creep gets down to his dirty business, my brain starts broadcasting 24/7 murdervision?",
