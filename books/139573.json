But when Scattia Blackthorne stumbles across a sinister discovery in the woods, she's pulled into a mystery more twisted than the handle of her broomstick. She'd forgotten how power can corrupt even the nicest of witches...A newcomer to the Hollow has been murdered. How will Scattia discover the perpetrator of the crime, when the village is in uproar and all her neighbors seem to be harboring mysterious secrets? It's not clear who she can trust anymore. Events take a further sinister turn when the High Witch goes missing... It's almost like the bad old days of the Witching Wars have come back...Will Scattia find out the truth before another crime is committed? And why does Wizard Mortis keep asking her out to dinner? And is it true that there's a traitor amongst her friends in Hazelstix Hollow?",
