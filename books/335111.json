  "title": "Possessive Puppy",
  "description": "I’m not used to seeing women, instead spending months alone with my trusty sidekick Molly in the Rocky Mountains, but I do come down and check-in from time to time. I see women then, and they never have an effect on me. All I do is come down to let my ‘bosses’ know I’m alive, collect my paycheck, and let them know how many smugglers and poachers I’ve removed. And then it’s back to my isolation, the self-imposed one that I enjoy so damn much. Until she comes along. Is that why I accept her as an intern? There’s just something about the curve in her hips. I want to protect her, provide for her, and keep her safe. There’s nothing to fear when she’s around me. Except for the biggest beast of all. Me. My dog and I are possessive creatures, territorial just like every animal is in its most basic form. And I’m already feeling damn territorial of her, just as Molly is of me. Mauve is going to be my intern all right, but she needs to understand right away it’s a lot more than that. She’s going to be mine…in every way. Forever. She’s one of us. And once you’re part of our pack it stays that way…for life.",
