  "title": "The Hypnotism Club",
  "description": "At the prestigious St. Catherine's Academy for Women, the dull, staid, boring Psychology Club was secretly the Hypnotism Club. Under the direction of its president, Jill, its members, including Jill's roommate Victoria, were fervent students of the art of erotic hypnosis, combined with a variety of exhibitions of lesbian sex. It was all innocent, entrancing fun and games until Jill and Victoria stumble into a darker secret that exists underneath St. Catherine's, a hypnotic secret that will change both of their lives and futures forever and threaten the existence of the Hypnotism Club.",
