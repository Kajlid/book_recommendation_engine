  "description": "Moira Ryan is a woman for whom love has never seemed to work. She has bad luck with men and has seen too many broken relationships in the lives of those she loves. She lives in the shadow of her beautiful and vivacious sister, Sloane, for whom everything seems to come easy, and whose upcoming wedding is only making her feel worse about her lonely life. Jack Wallace can't remember the last time he felt truly happy. After losing his mother as a teenager, he has treated women as an escape from the pressures of life, and hasn't committed to one for more than a few dates in years. Their worlds collide one day, and neither can deny the growing attraction between them. The story follows these two as they deal with life, death, weddings and love. It's a story about relationships between parents and children, sisters and friends, and most of all finding love when all odds are against it.",
