  "description": "The last thing Fallon Myers remembers before waking up as a prisoner was walking home from her favorite bodega. Now, she’s being forced to participate in sex shows for the crowds on Voyeur Moon, along with two political prisoners.Cord and Arlo have been fighting against the extreme faction of Tyranns who now control Voyeur Moon, and who built the infamous Zoo, for years. The charges against them are bogus, but their growing love for Fallon is real.The three can’t see or hear the crowds who pay to watch them have rough sex, but the shows take an emotional toll on all of them.When an opportunity to escape arises, the men face a difficult choice. If they leave Fallon behind, the Tyranns will simply place two new prisoners in her quarters. But if they take her along, all three could lose their lives.",
