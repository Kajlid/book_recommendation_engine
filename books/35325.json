  "description": "The first in a new erotic contemporary romance series, Inappropriate Thoughts is a scorching mix of desire, sex, love and slightly inappropriate comedy.Jillian Grayson is a disillusioned divorc√©e and best-selling romance novelist who can't write a chapter without her hunky male heartthrob suffering ED, an STD, or even worse. Brian Nash is a tennis-obsessed, college senior who's unlucky in love and the roommate and best friend of Jillian's son, Rob. When Rob brings Brian home for spring break and he meets the surprisingly young and also tennis passionate Jillian, their shared interest quickly develops into an intense mutual attraction. After nearly giving in to their feelings, they hatch a plan, while under the influence (of something more than just the perfect Miami night), to be friends with \"partial\" benefits complete with rules to define the boundaries. Will the lonely pair continue with this distinctive relationship, actually explore their desires or will they discover all of it is a really bad idea? READER ADVISORY:This story contains content some readers may find objectionable, including explicit sex and language.Inappropriate Thoughts is a more explicit version of another currently available novel.
