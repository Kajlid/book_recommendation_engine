  "description": "I’m a numbers girl.Or at least I thought I was, until my formula fell apart. Back home in Vermont, with my dream on hiatus, I’m working at the Busy Bean and taking online classes. As long as I keep my focus, I’ll be back in New York City next semester. Hopefully.When Declan O’Shaughnessy storms into the café, all muscles and tattoos, wielding his sexy Irish brogue like a weapon, the only equation I can solve is one that lands me in his bed. Even more dangerous, is my growing affection for his cherub-faced little boy.But Declan has complications of his own. He’s cagey, but I’ll win him over.Yeah, about that focus… mine is all on him. Can we have a harmless fling without getting hurt?",
