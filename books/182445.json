  "description": "For 26 year old Lee, the boredom of a 9 to 5 life made up of factory floors and warehouses is broken by a ticket for a third-rate Alaskan-bound cruise line. Once on the open sea and consumed with dreams of future life prospects, he recoils at the idea of returning to his previous life. An error by an inept crew member however, seemingly allows Lee the freedom and escape he yearns for. As idyllic as his newfound paradise appears to be, those trapped with Lee see it differently, and his attempts to reconcile his dreams with reality lead Lee towards frustration, desperation, and ever closer to insanity.",
