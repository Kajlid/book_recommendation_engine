  "description": "I don't break the rules. And falling for my little sister’s best friend would definitely be breaking the rules. Getting her pregnant was downright irresponsible.GARRETTAria is young. Too young. My little sister’s best friend is a shameless flirt—a free-spirited whirlwind of emotions. She shouldn’t appeal to me in the least. I’m looking to settle down with a suitable woman—someone mature, put-together, and not clingy, needy or emotionally dependent. Aria Davenport definitely does not fit this list.Yet the painfully beautiful minx is impossible to ignore. For one night, I give into temptation and let my need for her take over. ARIAAfter years of secretly pining and not-so-secretly flirting, the grumpy yet mysteriously alluring Garrett Caldwell finally looks my way. Maybe it was only once, and maybe that was exactly what we agreed to, but that one scorching night ties us together for the rest of our lives. An unexpected pregnancy with the town's hot doctor—a man I’ve never been able to keep my heart in check around—certainly has this small town talking. Suddenly he claims to want more, and I can’t help the doubt from creeping in. Knowing our relationship would be built on feelings of responsibility and obligation would break me.So I guard my heart against the one man who has the power to destroy it. ————The Surprise Seduction is a standalone, steamy, age gap, best friend's older brother, surprise pregnancy, opposites attract, grumpy sunshine romantic comedy.",
