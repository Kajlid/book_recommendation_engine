  "description": "Daniel crisscrossed America. Daniel took photos, tons of photos. Daniel sent photos to Rick. Rick selected shots for stories as if he was an elderly Italian picking store tomatoes. Rick wrote stories. Rick edited, re-wrote, re-edited said stories. Daniel couldn’t believe Rick killed characters. Rick couldn’t believe Daniel couldn’t believe Rick killed characters. But characters are killed off, just not in every story. Let's not get too morbid.",
