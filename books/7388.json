But afterward, Rafe went back to being untouchable and Josie didn't know how to break through his shell…even to tell him she was pregnant.Everything Rafe did was by the book and so his moment of weakness could never be repeated. He didn't deserve someone like Josie...even if it was a daily struggle to keep his hands off her. But learning she could ID a cold–blooded killer changed everything.
