  "description": "Part TwoLove didn’t come easy for Cash and Olivia. Forever will come even harder. But true love doesn’t give up, not even when dreams are crushed and reality isn’t quite the fairy tale you expected it to be. When Olivia married Cash Davenport, it was her dream come true. Cash was everything she wanted and everything she needed, all wrapped up in jet-black eyes and an irresistible smile. She thought since she’d finally found the ideal man, their life would play out like a fairy tale. And, for a while, it did. Until she found out that another woman, a woman from Cash’s past, has given him the one thing that Olivia can’t—a child. For Cash, seeing their baby growing inside his wife would only make a perfect marriage more perfect, but all he really needs for true happiness is the love of his life—Olivia. She wants to give him a child, though, and when she can’t conceive, it puts a strain on her that Cash can’t seem to alleviate. That strain explodes when Sophie Marks, Cash’s old flame, shows up at their door with a little girl in tow. A little girl she claims belongs to Cash. After all this time, can Sophie be trusted? Or has she returned with the sole intent of destroying the only real happiness Cash has ever known. **This is part one of a three-part serial novel. Each novella will be at least 20,000 words in length. Part two will be available July 1, 2015**",
