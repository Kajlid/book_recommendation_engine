  "description": "Frank Novak’s life is a hectic procession of events, since he’s the foremost neighborhood watchdog in San Gabriel, Texas. He thinks at times that things couldn’t get any worse for him, but he’s wrong. His wife is finding a Holy Roller preacher way too attractive, his camping trailer is stolen, and then his real problems begin—someone is trying to kill him.The idea of escaping to a reclusive life in the Texas Hill Country begins to seem very appealing; then Monica Cruz enters his life. She works for an agency that helps neighborhoods get organized to fight crime and decay—and she’s intelligent, intense, and best of all, interested in Frank.They make a good team—Frank with his determination to keep his neighborhood clear of problems, and Monica with her knowledge of what works in solving their problems—and her Taurus .38. Will all this be enough to keep them safe from the residents of the crack house on the corner or the angry man who doesn’t care how much pollution he causes in disposing of hazardous waste? They’re hoping that it will and that they’ll have a life together in spite of the odds.",
