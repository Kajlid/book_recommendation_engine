  "description": "Paolo Bacigalupi's debut collection demonstrates the power and reach of the science fiction short story. Social criticism, political parable, and environmental advocacy lie at the center of Paolo's work. Each of the stories herein is at once a warning, and a celebration of the tragic comedy of the human experience. The eleven stories in Pump Six represent the best of Paolo's work, including the Hugo nominee \"Yellow Card Man,\" the Nebula-and Hugo-nominated story \"The People of Sand and Slag,\" and the Sturgeon Award-winning story \"The Calorie Man.\" The title story is original to this collection. With this book, Paolo Bacigalupi takes his place alongside SF short fiction masters Ted Chiang, Kelly Link and others, as an important young writer that directly and unabashedly tackles today's most important issues.Contents:Pocketful of Dharma (1999)The Fluted Girl (2003)The People of Sand and Slag (2004)The Pasho (2004)The Calorie Man (2005)The Tamarisk Hunter (2006)Pop Squad (2006)Yellow Card Man (2006)Softer (2007)Pump Six (2008)",
