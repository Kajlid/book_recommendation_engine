  "description": "When I dreamâ€¦she said she loved me and my heart raced, my brown eyes were set aglow as the unseen power that lives within was awaken by her sweet love. My love grew through the night on the crow's endless flight, and as the one that I love returned with her loving words, my heart was again empowered with love only she would come to know, and I married her. I love you.",
