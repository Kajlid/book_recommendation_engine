  "description": "In Things Are Going to Slide, Marilee Carson Cooper, daughter of a prominent southern family, teaches law and runs a law school legal aid clinic in the small Alabama town her family has inhabited for generations. But then things slip out of her control. She is pregnant with her second child when her husband leaves her for another man. She loses a coveted job--to her first love--that would ensure her financial security, and she is desperately trying to help a teen-age mother accused of murdering her baby. Described by one reader as \"smart chick-lit/mom-lit,law-lit\", and another as\"the kind of book that makes you keep reading long after you meant to turn out the light.\"",
