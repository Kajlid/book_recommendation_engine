  "title": "Losing the Hate",
  "description": "In his book, Losing the Hate, Simon Palmer has combined his mastery of storytelling with a raw hard look at the issues one faces as a result of child sexual abuse. It is an honest attempt to shed light on the darkest of subject matters. Simon has offered up his experiences in bone chilling detail, giving the reader a first hand account of his journey from innocence to depravity. His downward spiral is both shocking and heart wrenching, but most of all it is honest. Losing the Hate has been rightfully described as \"jaw-dropping.\" It is brutally raw, and yet, despite the atrocious circumstances, the author manages to mesmerize his readers with a delicate hand and a bountifully open heart. In Simon's own words, \"I have lived within this dark cloud for most of my life, with many complex issues still unresolved. There is a feeling of complete and utter loneliness within me, and, in desperation to rid my world of darkness, I have chosen to put my story into words . . . telling the world of my nightmare.\"",
