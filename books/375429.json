  "description": "Meet the Soren sisters. Gloria, 29, is a way-out San Francisco lesbian who won and lost an international journalism award only to reinvent herself as a glitter spray salesgirl. Her sister Angie is spearheading an evangelical anti-abortion movement in Atlanta and no longer talks to their parents. That is, until Gloria tries putting her life-and their family-back together. In this transporting, funny story, O'Briant explores subcultures at cross-purposes, inhabited by two radically different sisters who love each other anyway.",
