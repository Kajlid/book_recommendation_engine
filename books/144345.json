  "description": "In the aftermath of Voyager's encounter with the badly wounded member of Species 8472 and Seven of Nine's believed assault at the hands of weapons merchant Kovin, Captain Kathryn Janeway and the former borg drone begin to realize the true depth of their feelings toward one another. They're forced to face their fear and inexperience while deal with a melding crew, a disastrous away mission, and the Captainâ€™s sense of duty and feelings of responsibility for stranding the crew in the Delta Quadrant...This is a very large series, consisting of 50 stories broken down into five 'seasons'. It follows the trials and tribulations of the relationship between Janeway and Seven which begins somewhere near the end of the first year Seven came on the ship (season four on the show) and carries them all the way back to the Alpha Quadrant and to a new vessel.Posted: February, 1998 - January 26th, 2001Cover by Calli's Creations",
