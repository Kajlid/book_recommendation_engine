All he did was work, work, work, except for the few hours a week he spent online with a dominant who seemed to get him. When he met his dom in person quite by accident, it changed everything, especially when he fell in love with the man behind the online persona.  At thirty-four Dusty Brandon had been involved in his alternative lifestyle for ages, but hadn't had a sub in years until he met Blake online. The more he knew him, the more he wanted to take things further. Getting through Blake's barriers used all the knowledge he had, but getting his boy to move to Texas took even more.
