  "title": "Memoirs of a Butterfly: Letters to a Caterpillar",
  "description": "Did you know that 98% of caterpillars don't make it to the butterfly stage? What do the 2% have that the others didn't? When a caterpillar becomes a butterfly, it takes all of its experiences and everything that lives inside itself and transforms into a beautiful creature. What people don’t always notice is the metamorphosis - the isolation, the discomfort, even the pain. It’s usually all about the finished product. Well, imagine if the butterfly were able to go back and examine all of the moments that the caterpillar experienced in the process that shaped the finished product. This book is the butterfly’s opportunity to revisit, forgive, and even affirm the caterpillar from the other side.In this interactive journal, Terryca Taylor uses her personal experiences to take you through your own process of transformation and healing. You will be challenged to reflect and grow from what shaped you.",
