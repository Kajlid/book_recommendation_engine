Cara is assaulted by Danny Dreffin, an unemployed, unpopular Glaswegian computer programmer who is trying to get her into bed. Mike has a public row with this man, a Scottish Nationalist, and has no alibi when the Glaswegian is later found beaten to death.Central Scotland Police believe Mike may be the killer and Cara turns to a Mensan Garda detective in Dublin, Ricky Norton, for help. He agrees to work on the case if they send him information by e-mail about their fellow Mensan guests. Then it seems that everyone is pleased that Dreffin is dead. Asking questions of the guests from various countries is certain to put the couple in danger, and they only have one day to keep Mike from being charged.By the Amazon No. 1 Bestselling author of MURDER AGAINST THE CLOCK and MURDER AT IRISH MENSA.Clare O'Beara won the Arkady Renko short story competition held by Simon & Schuster in 2014 and judged by Martin Cruz Smith.\"Please congratulate Clare O'Beara for me for her clever short, short story 'London Calling.'
