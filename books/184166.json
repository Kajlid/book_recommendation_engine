  "description": "Less Beauty and the Beast and more Tolkien, this second Orc Saga adventure will force Arianna and Bolthorn to overcome their greatest fears, with the life of their unborn child and the safety of their world hanging in the balance.Princess Arianna never wanted to return to her human kingdom of Gautar. Not after she helped murder her abusive father to escape. Not since the orc Bolthorn defied death and tradition to make her his wife. And though the coldest days of winter are behind them, Arianna is still recovering the strength she needs to bring their half-orc child safely into the world.The Ancestors, however, have other plans. Bolthorn's kin disappeared through the mountain passage to Gautar months ago and Arianna won’t abandon any orc to the cruel mercy of her father’s people. Just as worrisome, Arianna’s sister is trapped within the castle, a pawn and plaything of the new king.But there is power at work in Gautar that even the Ancestors fear. Power and magic that a princess and an orc cannot hope to conquer alone. Hiding their expedition from human eyes would be difficult enough, but the growing dangers they face across the mountain threaten to destroy not just the human kingdoms, but the safety and freedom of the orcs, as well.",
