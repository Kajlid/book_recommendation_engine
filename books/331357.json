  "description": "Lemony Snicket meets Breaking Bad meets The Griswold's in an unforgettable comedic journey of a lifetime.Sometimes life is stranger than fiction.Can you recount the tales of selling your first home? The excitement beforehand, the anticipation, as you anxiously await for that momentous day to arrive...sold!Well, as Mr. Grake can attest, the first time selling your home can be an experience, unlike anything imaginable.Have you ever had something happen to you, so ridiculous, so mind boggling, so unbelievable that it makes you think to yourself...WTF!All Mr. Grake wants to do is sell the family home. What could be simpler?Along the way he encounters two lunatic assassins (realtors) that take advantage of his family and their kindness.One assassin flies the coup while another constructs a sinister plan to reveal Mr. Grake’s “true” identity.As things go from bad to worse, to something else entirely...as Mr. Grake is accused of murdering one of his children and stuffing their lifeless corpse under the bed. But that’s not all, as they’d lead you to believe Mr. Grake is cooking meth in his garage a la Heisenberg from Breaking Bad.So he fires them. Deciding, “Hey, we should tell the news about this\".An interview with the news turns into “the fallout” from hell; with the end of Amazon, to The Grake’s navigating a bomb on a severely turbulent flight. The madness rages on during a six month journey filled with misadventure as The Grake’s attempt to sell their home and move far, far away.",
