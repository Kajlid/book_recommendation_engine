  "description": "The King is defeated, the spirit of the Mantra has been restored, Suni is reunited with her father and yet: all is not quite right. Wanda and his cousin Luna live in the valley beyond the mountains: Luna dreams of dragons while Wanda, gifted with the ability to communicate with animals, struggles with his own shadow. Ntombi blames Wanda for Luna's condition. Meanwhile, in the town by the sea, Suni fears for her dear friends, and watches over them with her own gift. Many, including Suni's father, suffer from a strange affliction. The townspeople blame the Mantra. Then strangers arrive from the sea, bringing hope: but in this land of gifts and curses, is anything what it seems to be?",
