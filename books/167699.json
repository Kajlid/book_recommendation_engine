  "description": "(Ages 4-8) It's the Day of the Dead! It's time to celebrate! In this bilingual book, a young girl is busy helping her family prepare to honor those who have died. First she goes with her mama to the market to buy pan de muerto. Then she lays a path of marigold petals with her papa. But mostly, she thinks of her abuelito. She misses him very much and is excited for his spirit to visit that night. And when she sees the butterflies fly through the sky, she knows that his spirit is with them. Written in both Spanish and English, this book includes activities and recipes just right for any Day of the Dead celebration. Loretta Lopez's colorful illustrations perfectly complement Janice Levy's child-friendly introduction to this important holiday. Ms. Levy and Ms. Lopez, who both live in New York State, previously collaborated on Celebrate! It's Cinco de Mayo! / ¡Celebremos! ¡Es el Cinco de Mayo!",
