  "description": "It happened without warning. A media blackout, a military coup, and suddenly the U.S.A. became the U.S.S.A. â€” the United Secure States of America. Whatever they called it, it was still a police state. Overnight, rock music was banned, movies were censored, and outspoken teachers began to vanish. Soon, any person who dared question the new authorities was in danger as well.Eddie Ludlow was just a regular high school student in a small Ohio town, but he know that somebody had to stand up to the new government before America was lost. He also knew there had to be others like him. A small, secret band of rebels was born. They took the same name the new authorities had given America and made it their own.A brave new series of America's freedom fighters of tomorrow!",
