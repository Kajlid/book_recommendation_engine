  "description": "We think in logical, linear progressions, but life doesn’t follow a well-paved path. Looking back, we create structure and memories to define who we are. But these are constructs built from our desire to understand. Looking back, Ryan Connolly isn’t telling us who he is. Ryan is telling us who he thinks he is. Ryan is looking back through a broken window into the the room inside his mind. Born in Salt Lake City, Utah to a Mormon mother and a Catholic father who never seemed to like each other, Ryan was a standard suburban-bred mama’s boy. Before he could remember, Ryan’s family moved to Northern Virginia. Pretending to be middle-class, Ryan’s family lived just outside of their means. Then his mom died. And after, traumatized by her death, but also reveling in the opportunity to redefine himself, Ryan journeys into himself. He does drugs, he fights, and quickly digresses into a blunt smoking, cappuccino drinking punk. His father sinks into depression and booze, leaving Ryan angry and free. His older brother is in Utah, attending university, unaware of the father’s collapse. Yet, Ryan’s story ends well. Is it because of societal privilege, familial determination, self-preservation, or twisted fate? Looking back, a senior in college, Ryan marvels at his story and his ability to trick those around him that he is just another middle-class college kid.",
