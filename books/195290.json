  "description": "My life is a secret. His life is dangerous. We’re both stubborn, calculating, and controlling. Mark Dixon doesn’t know what he’s getting into. He doesn’t know his games could cost us our lives. I have to do what is necessary to keep us alive, and that means guarding my heart. But I know I’m defenseless against him, and in the end, he’ll force me to surrender.  ** This is book 5 in The Salvation Series and can be read as a standalone, although for maximum enjoyment, it's advised to read Beloved, Beholden, Consolation & Conviction first as all the characters appear throughout. **",
