Josie usually keeps to herself, but she comes out of her shell when she and her dog, Clementine, volunteer at the local hospital during the holiday season. Josie loves dressing up in silly costumes, singing carols, and helping to prepare for the big Christmas Festival. That is, until she learns that this year's Festival has been canceled. Meanwhile, Oscar's parents are fighting more and more--and so is he. He gets into trouble at school, and his punishment? Volunteer hours at the local hospital. Gabby's life seems perfect. She's stylish, smart, and everyone looks up to her. But Gabby has a secret, one that could ruin everything. Then, Clementine disappears, Oscar's parents separate, and Gabby's secret is uncovered. Together, can Josie, Oscar, and Gabby find a way to save the holiday, or will this be the worst Christmas ever? Daphne Benedis-Grab, author of The Angel Tree, has created a heartwarming story that sparkles with humor, light, and Christmas spirit.",
