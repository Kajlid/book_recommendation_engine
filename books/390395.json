  "description": "Unlikely romance is sometimes just an inconvenient marriage away Charlotte Beck may be entering adulthood, but she can t seem to keep to her stubborn, independent spirit from bucking social protocol. Fed up with her behavior, Charlotte s father Daniel pressures her to settle into a nice marriage despite knowing she is set on going to college. Then Daniel sees Charlotte with the handsome but annoying English astronomer Alex Hambly, and everything changes. Though Alex and Charlotte can barely stand one another, Daniel offers them a deal they can t refuse: if they agree to marry, he will save Alex s family from financial ruin and grant Charlotte the freedom to go to college. Reluctantly the couple agrees, but in private they plot to annul the marriage as soon as possible. But when Alex s feelings change and he refuses to dissolve their contract, will Charlotte find a way out of her vows? Or will she discover that maybe this marriage isn t so inconvenient after all?\"",
