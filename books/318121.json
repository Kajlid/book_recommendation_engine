  "description": "In this enchanting contemporary romance, sure to delight readers of Rachel Gibson and Susan Elizabeth Phillips, a close encounter of the sexy kind leads a plain Jane to discover her wild side. Chloe Sinclair has never been bad . . . until she stumbles—literally—into the arms of a gorgeous stranger. To make matters worse, the morning after, her world is rocked completely off its axis when the sensual dreamboat turns out to be the man brought in to save the TV station where she works. Sterling Prescott is hard-driven, gorgeous as hell, and determined to turn the struggling KTEX into a success. But all bets are off when the shameless wildcat that disappeared on him last night walks back into his life—acting like a squeaky-clean librarian. Life gets truly complicated, however, when Sterling decides to win more than the station—and to show Chloe that being sexy isn’t a sin.",
