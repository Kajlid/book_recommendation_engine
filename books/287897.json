  "description": "Whoever said you can’t go home again can kiss my Spanx-covered butt!  At least that’s what Alexandria ‘Lex’ Luther thinks as she crosses the city limits to her hometown, the one place she never wants to see again. Circumstances might have forced her back, but no way will Lex get suckered into sticking around this time. She’s even poured herself into her favorite little white dress to prove to everyone, especially her family, that she’s shaken off the dust from this podunk little town for good.  Unfortunately, Lex’s triumphant homecoming is spoiled when she quite literally falls head over heels for Grayson Conrad, the town’s newest resident and most eligible bachelor. His quick thinking and even quicker hands may have saved her dress from ruination, but those mile-deep dimples, dazzling blue peepers, and stupidly long eyelashes might just be her ruination, if she’s not careful.  Because the last thing Lex needs is to fall for a man who left the bright lights of the big city to settle down in a sleepy small town. What was he even thinking? As soon as she finishes up with her family business, she’s blowing this popsicle stand and nothing’s going to stop her.  Not even dimples and stupidly long lashes.  This heartwarming standalone small town romcom is full of love, smiles, and enough quirky townfolk to have you laughing out loud!  *Previously published as Back Home Again.",
