Life Knocks is Craig Stone’s second novel. It’s the memoir of the British author and his struggle with love, friendship and isolation in his mid-twenties. When he was 24, he worked in an office and dreamt of living a life. Anxious he was already trapped in a life he hated forever, he quit his job to seek a life less travelled. He fell in love, lived in Hawaii and travelled Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. By the age of 28, he’s back in London and living in Willesden Green. He’s back working in an office and living in a small studio flat after battling homelessness, drugs, poverty, alcohol and life again. He can’t figure out how to fit back into London life, but finds solace and companionship in an unlikely friendship with the man he hates the most in the world: his racist, homophobic, bastard landlord Mohammad. Mohammad is elderly, lonely, bitter and suffering possible dementia. Colossus (the name of the main character) wants to be a recluse, to drink and wallow in the misery of youth, but Mohammad wants to make him his best friend, and he only lives in the flat downstairs. Colossus and Mohammad are alone, but they soon discover in this life of love lost and friendships gained, that they have a lot more in common than either knows how to face... AWARDS Life Knocks was shortlisted for the world respected Dundee International Book Prize.",
