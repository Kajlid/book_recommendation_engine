  "description": "Twelve-year-old Felix is fascinated. She has never met a woman like Grace -- beautiful, mysterious, and a citizen of the world. If it weren't for Grace, the family's trip to Spain might have been pretty dull. The trouble started when Felix and her stepsister Amy got lost in the middle of Spain, and Grace came to their rescue. Grace not only helped them find the rest of the family, but volunteered to show Felix, Amy, and her brother castles and windmills and Grace's car, bouncing down a dusty back road, when Felix realizes something is very wrong. Grace is not her friend...and they're headed for the most dangerous and terrifying experience of their lives!",
