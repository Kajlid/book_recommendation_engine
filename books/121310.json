  "description": "This steamy, one bed romantic comedy will bring all the laughs while making your cheeks blush at the same time. Sometimes the quietest are the most . . . vocal . . .Word to the wise, never become roommates with a girl you’ve been pining over for the better part of a year.You’re probably wondering why I would do such a thing? Well, I didn’t.It was my teammates.The moment they found out Blakely White was single, they took it upon themselves to play cupid and instruct me on how I should win her over.Don't wear a shirt around her.Make her dinner.Lightly touch her shoulder when you say goodbye.I'm so flustered, so overwhelmed, so madly in love with this woman who barely notices me, that I lose control of the situation and make one huge mistake: I offer to be her fake date for a wedding so she can make her ex jealous.That means, for one whole night I get a free pass with her. I get to hold her, dance with her, kiss her…stare at her from across the room like she’s my entire world because she has been for months now.But when the night comes to an end, I’m faced with two options: bring her back to my bedroom and show her how I really feel, or let her walk away, succumbing to the fact that I very well might not be her type.",
