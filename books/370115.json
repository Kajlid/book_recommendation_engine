  "description": "In the early 1980s, living in rural poverty in one of the wealthiest counties in Pennsylvania, Flora McDermott has found an epic love. Everett Finn has that \"Black Irish\" look, with the black black bottom-of-the-abyss hair and contrasting eyes of sky. When she sits in his high school English class, Flora can think of little else. She has no choice; her pens are possessed; she has to flood him with love notes and poetry. After all, one never knows what could happen in life. He just may give in to her if she perseveres. A coming-of-age story with a bite, Floraâ€™s sojourn is of the rudiments that persist in the human heart, dreams, memory, love, and family, and the ever-mysterious and mutable definition of self.",
