  "description": "Enter an enchanted world where a fisherman risks his soul for the love of a mermaid, a giant discovers the power of kindness, and a nightingale pours its heart into a single red rose.\nOscar Wilde’s stories shimmer with the magic of folklore and his signature sparkling wit. But beware—these are no ordinary fairy tales. Beneath their glittering surfaces, sacrifice and selflessness often go unrecognized, cruelty and greed weave dark spells, and love, though radiant, is as delicate as gold leaf. Wilde upends the traditions of children’s tales, spinning stories that both enchant and unsettle. Beautifully designed with fairy tale flourishes, this book is as delightful to hold as it is to read.PERFECT FORLovers of beautiful storytelling and thought-provoking literatureFans of Oscar Wilde’s wit and styleAdmirers of elegantly designed booksGifting to book lovers, dreamers, and those who enjoy a bit of wonder and magic ⋆✴︎˚。⋆",
