  "description": "Sitting in a beautiful garden, high atop a flower, the impressionable Buzzy reads in the book, Learn to Fly, the very true fact that, \"Bumblebees weren't made to fly.\" He reads again, \"Bumblebees weren't made to fly.\" \"Stranded on top of a flower/ Buzzy longed to fly away./ His heart still knew how/ But his head had forgotten the way.\" The adventure that ensues challenges Buzzy to overcome obstacles without his wings that he had never before thought possible. He travels over the stream and through the high grass, back home where his parents with love and support tell him, \"You're doubting yourself./ Fear is in the way./ Listen to your heart Buzzy/ Not what others say./ Ignore labels and limits Buzzy./ They seldom do good./ You start to think, 'I Can't,'/ when you should be thinking, 'I Could.'\" Its vibrant illustrations and clear, thoughtful message make Buzzy the Bumblebee a motivating and heartwarming story for all ages. \"He stopped doubting himself/ And didn't need to know, 'Why.'/ He believed once again/ And was able to FLY.\"",
