  "description": "WHITE AND OTHER TALES OF RUIN collects together six of Tim Lebbon's novellas, two of them brand new to this collection. From the all-powerful natural horrors of The First Law, to the man-made terrors of The Origin of Truth, this collection explores existence at the very edge of survival ... for humankind itself. The British Fantasy Award-winning White gives an ambiguous vision of a frozen hell-on-earth, while the new novella Hell locates it even nearer to our hearts. From Bad Flesh tells of diseased flesh, while the brand new Mannequin Man and the Plastic Bitch contains many maladies of the mind, most of them considered normal in the sick world it inhabits...Contents:* White* From Bad Flesh* Hell (original)* The First Law* The Origin of Truth* Mannequin Man and the Plastic Bitch (original)",
