  "description": "First published in 2001, this is the classic true story of the men who sought — and found — a great diamond mine on the last frontier of the far north. From a bloody 18th-century trek across the Canadian tundra to the daunting natural forces facing protagonists Chuck Fipke and Stewart Blusson in the 1990s as they struggle against the mighty DeBeers cartel, this is the definitive account of one of the world’s great mineral discoveries. Combining geology, science history, raw nature and high intrigue, it is also a tale of supreme adventure, taking the reader into a magical — and now fast-vanishing — wild landscape. Now in a newly revised and updated edition.“Masterful… at once a scientific thriller, excursion into industrial espionage, and page-turning paean to obsession.” — Smithsonian“Krajick, a talented storyteller, strikes it rich.” — The Economist",
