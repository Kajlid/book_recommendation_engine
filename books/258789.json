  "title": "Craved by an Alien",
  "description": "I was abducted by aliens and auctioned to a positively lovely bleak place called the Underwater Pleasure Dome. An amphibious alien with hands like bug zappers helped spring me, and if you’ve followed my friends’ adventures, you know Dohrein and I teamed up because we’re both equally stellar, and awesome attracts awesome. This is the story of what happened *after* abduction life. The good part. The part where we settle in and build brand new lives on this brand new planet. I just need to have tea with my Alien-in-law and convince her to set her pet humans free. No biggie. *Wish me luck.*  **NOTE: Is this a Standalone? Not really. A few brave booksouls who started the series with this story jumped right in and enjoyed, so it’s *possible,* but I also created a Cast List Recap that will patch you through if you want a bit of a guide to this world.  ***Another Note: You'll find this is approx 70K words of Dohrein & Gracie’s story, followed by a 10K bonus story revealing what happens when a Rakhii gets loose on Earth.",
