In the epic conclusion to the GOLDEN DAUGHTER adventure, the Dragon unleashes deadly force upon mortal and immortal worlds alike. Harnessing the power of the Dream Walkers, he breaks through the gates of Hulan’s garden, and fire rains down from the sky.  Can one brave young woman, armed only with her courage and training, face these supernatural forces and rescue the mistress she has sworn to protect? Can anyone prevent the ultimate destruction of the very heavens above and the silencing of the Spheres’ eternal song?",
