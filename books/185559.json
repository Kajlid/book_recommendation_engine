  "description": "It is said that if you lie with snakes for long enough, you either become a snake or you get bitten and die. Makes perfect sense. Except if you are a wolf. If you are a wolf, you lie in wait, you bide your time, and right when their guard is down you kill that f#@king snake. Jessa Lebron – currently prisoner of asshole dragon king.In the epic conclusion to the Supernatural Prison trilogy, Jessa Lebron finds herself deep in the world of Larkspur, the dragon king. She will have to play it smart and fight with everything to stay one step ahead of him and while at times it’s tough to keep her focus, she will do anything to escape and reunite with her boys, the Compass quads. Of course, it’s impossible to be where she is and not dig deeper into the curse of the dragon mark. As more information is uncovered, she starts to understand why she, of all supernaturals, was the one to be singled out. And this changes everything she thought she knew.Turns out she doesn’t know a damn thing. There will be decisions to make. Tough decisions. Jessa has to be strong enough for the sake of the supernatural races, but sometimes that’s easier said than done.",
