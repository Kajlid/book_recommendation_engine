  "description": "The Desire of Ages, Volume 3 of the Conflict of the Ages series, is Ellen White's classic on the life of Jesus - the One who stands at the center of all human history. No one else has had such a profound influence on planet Earth as Jesus Christ. In this book the author does not set forth the events of Jesus' life in strict chronological order, but she presents Him as the One who can satisy the deepest yearnings of the human heart. She presents the divine beauty of the life of the Savior, the love of God as revealed in His Son. New and glorious light flashes from many familiar passages of Scripture. Follow Jesus in these pages from His birth in Bethlehem's stable to His death on the cross, His glorious resurrection, and His triumphant return to heaven.",
