  "description": "Dear Author,My boyfriend and I have decided to take the next step in our relationship and exchange keys. He works odd hours as he’s a (cop, FBI, commando, doesn’t matter as long as it’s cool and dangerous). I have a secret that I haven’t told him yet, I like to dress in women’s underwear. I’m not ashamed of this at all; I just haven’t found the right way to tell him, it doesn’t go over well with everyone. I don’t think he’ll have a problem with it, but you have to take your time with these things.Photo Description: There are two photographs.Photo 1: In the first photograph a young, attractive man is dancing. He wears only panties, bra and a hat. His face is hidden, perhaps suggesting secrecy.Photo 2: In the other photograph a man stands with his hands in his pockets, baring his toned chest. He wears sunglasses and has a surly expression.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love’s Landscapes\" event.
