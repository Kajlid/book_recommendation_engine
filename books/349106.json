Melisande St. Clair is running away to avoid her impending marriage to Lord Bellingham, and decides to take pity and trust the madman that claims he's from the future. It's only after an adventure of a lifetime and a scandal that won't quiet down that Flynn and Melisdane realize that there is a power greater than themselves at work.",
