  "title": "Jane Eyre",
  "description": "Charlotte Bronte's impassioned novel is the love story of Jane Eyre, a plain yet spirited governess, and her arrogant, brooding Mr. Rochester. Published in 1847, under the pseudonym of Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine—one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect and tireless perseverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved. Hailed by William Makepeace Thackeray as \"the masterwork of great genius,\" Jane Eyre is still regarded, over a century later, as one of the finest novels in English literature.",
