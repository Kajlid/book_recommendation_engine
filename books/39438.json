Collecting acclaimed cartoonist Shannon Wheeler’s musings on modern life, Cutie Island brings together Too Much Coffee Man and a host of other characters into one neuroses-packed volume!A new cartoon collection from the mind of Eisner Award-winning, Harvey-nominated, and current New Yorker cartoonist, Shannon Wheeler! Too Much Coffee Man, the long-underwear-clad hero, returns to the printed page in his first new adventures since having his life remade in opera form. Wheeler remains one of the best satirists of a generation, lending a hilariously cynical eye to Too Much Coffee Man’s struggle to make sense of the ever-changing modern world—with a space-octopus thrown in for good measure, of course.",
