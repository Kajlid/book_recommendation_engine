  "description": "She has a loving husband and a successful career–who says you can’t have it all? Miranda Quinn is living her very best life… until she’s not. It’s been two years since her legal advice TV show was canceled, but the former Assistant District Attorney has rebounded with a late-night radio show, Miranda Nights . When her closest friend’s teenaged son gets arrested, Miranda tries to help but the evidence against him is overwhelming. Following a family member’s medical diagnosis, Miranda begins to wonder if her ‘happily ever after’ has been canceled as well. But the real trouble arrives when a persistent caller, desperate for Miranda’s attention, embarks on an all-out effort to get her to see the error of her ways. Threatening messages and slanderous social media posts escalate to break-ins and arson when a fanatical fan claims to be her only path to salvation. Miranda Nights is a fast-paced, witty story full of hidden dangers, with a strong and resilient woman at its core.",
