  "description": "In nine days, modern civilization will come to a jolting halt. Unaware she stands on the brink of a global catastrophe of unprecedented magnitude, Amoreena Daniels embarks on a goodwill mission to the Yucatan jungles of southern Mexico. Four years have passed since her involuntary participation in a diabolical transgenic cloning experiment and subsequent narrow escape from the Las Canas research facility buried deep in the Guatemalan rainforests. Amoreena is ready to move on with her life.  Only weeks before her graduation from UCLA Medical School, Amoreena and her new boyfriend, Dr. Robert Kincaid, fly to the Yucatan where they will deliver care to the poor. Early in the trip, though, Amoreena and her colleagues are caught totally unprepared by the massive spread of illness. In one night, all of Amoreena’s coworkers succumb horribly to enferma de diablo, the devil’s sickness. An entire village is wiped out. Thus the nightmare begins as Amoreena confronts her nemesis from GARGOYLES. She reunites with her companions from Las Canas, and together they must flee for their lives. But this time there is no place to run. No place is safe. While attempting to save her own life, Amoreena is suddenly confronted with another startling revelation, one that just might hold the key to the salvation of mankind. Fasten your seat belts, close your eyes, and pray like hell, because the world as we know it is coming to an end!",
