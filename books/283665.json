  "description": "Forbidden fruit always tastes that much sweeter…\n\n\n\n\nHe was mean.\n\nCold. \n\nBeautiful. \n\nBut somehow charming to everyone else. \n\nWith Phoebe, his student? He was bitter and hard. \n\nUntil… \n\nHe was harder. Colder. Meaner. \n\nAnd she had no choice but to take everything he had to give. \nA desperate act, Phoebe's tumble from grace, and a man waiting in the wings to watch her downfall. The Professor is no hero. No charming knight. He’s a predator stalking his prey, and Phoebe, a college student struggling to get by, just walked into his crosshairs because even monsters have needs... A standalone bully romance. May offend or upset sensitive readers. Contains scenes with stalking.",
