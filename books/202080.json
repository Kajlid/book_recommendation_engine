  "description": "One bad lust fueled decision leaves Jamie Finch the victim of a bite-and-run. Now faced with turning into a werewolf--a state there is no shifting back from--he chooses to embrace his new nature and leaves the human world behind. When he finds the Wildwood pack, one wolf's scent drives Jamie to the brink of rationality. He learns forming an empathic bond with a mate will cool his desires, and he can't deny the longing to finally find a place in the world where he's wanted. But the power of the mating season is strong, and the mating ritual itself leaves Jamie up for grabs to any interested wolf.
