  "description": "Who is Lain? Memory won't plot a straight path for any wanderers...and mother and father? Not to be found. A cherished toy doll may be a key, a curse, or a cryptic clue. A disembodied voice bounces off a child's bedroom wall, issuing mysterious directions. What do you believe? Where can you turn? There's talk on the streets, and it comes and goes in rapid bursts. Anything is possible during dreamtime, but the floor feels so real...until it all melts away into absolute darkness. Who is Lain? Can you crack the code alone? Lain is Lain.Inimitable artistry binds together the jagged pieces of Lain, a mesmerizing tale of lost identity and shattered memories. A series fo blind visions and childhood fantasies whirl and weave with clipped conversation, floating questions, and the ever-present search for the who, what and where of the elusive Lain. A stunning visual playground shaded with both light and shadow, ABe's Lain is a triumph of design and an ever-growing puzzle.Description from book jacket",
