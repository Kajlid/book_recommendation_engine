  "description": "Among Beth Moore’s very best-selling books to date is Believing God, a powerful study of Isaiah 43 and Hebrews 11 that centers on one simple yet bold question: do you believe God or merely believe in Him? Moore explains how God’s plan is for the believer’s life to really work so all will know His promises are entirely true. When we begin to take God at His Word, the result is a fresh, contagious explosion of faith.And now the enduring favorite is available in a convenient day-by-day reading format, reminding us time and again that God is bigger than we can imagine and faithful to be who He says He is, do what He says He can do, and help us be who He says we are. Believe it!",
