  "description": "Gently, with warm, consoling, and practical guidance, Doug Manning addresses the painful, often disorientation aftermath of the death of a loved one, helping the bereaved cope with the emotions and confront the decisions that are an inevitable part of this time of radical life adjustment. Beginning with the premise that \"grief is not an enemy; it is a friend. It is the natural process of walking through the hurt and growing through the walk,\" Manning helps readers face up to grief, move through it, and learn to live again. With the first shock of loss, a survivor is faced with what seems like an overwhelming number of arrangements that must be made immediately. Don't Take My Grief Away is a complete, helpful handbook covering such important areas as the choice of a minister, family dynamics during such stressful times, and personalizing the funeral service. Doug Manning assists us to understand what happens when someone dies, to accept it, and to face the feelings of loss, separation, and even guilt that we experience in realistic yet healing way. The author provides thoughtful advice for rebuilding a grief-shattered life while taking to heart the valuable lessons death and mourning impart to everyone.",
