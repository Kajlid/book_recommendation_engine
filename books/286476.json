  "title": "Blacked",
  "description": "BLACKED comprises Roman's first conceptual poetry collection. It is thematically designed in a series of four sectional sequences that follow a young, native, boy on his journey. The entire collection is written as a narrative poem with each of the 38 poems written as an account of the central character's journey. The journey is physical in form, but spiritual in nature, and the adventure incorporates elements of the boy's geographical progress with Swahili and Arabic language elements. You'll note that the four sections are written in Swahili, translated to city, desert, savanna, and jungle. As the boy moves through the sequences of the tale he undergoes a recombinant transformation of essence and spirit, ultimately descending into a jungle of darkness which casts a physical manifestation of the torment and internal travesty he holds within.With a slew of nods to classic literary works, from The Iliad's Odyssey to Catch-22, this work is the most dense and thoughtful project Roman has undertaken to this point. The authentic motifs in language and culture create an immersive experience that takes you inside the boy's spiritual and psychological metamorphosis, joining the reader with the young boy on his pilgrimage.",
