  "description": "To live in captivity, adopted by the enemies of her people, or to break the law and tradition by running away? That question did not occur to Onheda until after she fled Little Falls on the spur of the moment, against any better judgment. If she was to die in the woods, making her way back to her people, accused, even by them, of breaking the ancient custom, it was still the better choice. She would not live among the enemies. Two moons of that had been more than enough.And yet, embarking upon her dangerous journey, she never expected to cross the path of the man who came to change the world of her people and their enemies alike. Who was he? A mysterious foreigner from across the Great Sparkling Water, a man with unusual ideas or the Messenger of the Great Spirits? And was he about to change her life, too?",
