She meets an un-humanly beautiful boy at school whom she is drawn to despite his odd and rude behavior towards her. Evan Blake is beautiful, intriguing and something about him is not quite human. When Evan is rude one minute and then nice to her the next, Emma begins to question things about this strange boy. As Evan does his best to avoid Emma, she tries to keep her distance from him as well, but something about him keeps drawing her to him like a moth to a flame. After saving Emma’s life several times, in what seems to be an unlikely situation, Emma becomes more persistent to find out what secrets this intriguing boy is hiding. As the weeks pass, Evan finally confesses to Emma that he isn’t as human as he pretends to be. Evan tells her he is half Human- half Vampire, just trying to fit in this small town as a human with his family. As Evan and Emma become inseparable in their short time together, danger begins to lurk and Evan and his family are forced to protect Emma. Emma begins to realize that Astoria is filled with dark secrets and lies and she starts to struggle to fit into Evan’s paranormal world. And she soon learns that not everyone in Astoria is human, nor are they Vampire, herself included. Astoria: The Blood Moon is unlike Twilight. It has unexpected twists and turns throughout that will keep readers on edge wanting more till the very end.",
