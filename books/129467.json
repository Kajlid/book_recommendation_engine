  "description": "THE SEVENTH VOLUME IN THE CLASSIC CHARLES SCHULTZ PEANUTS COLLECTION! PEANUTS and its creator, Charles M. Schulz are arguably the world's most famous newspaper comic strip and cartoonist in history. The Peanuts cartoon strip holds the distinction of being the world's longest continuing story, running for a staggering 17,897 strips from October 1950 to February 2000. Peanuts tells the story of meek, nervous Charlie Brown (a boy incapable of flying a kite, hitting a baseball or kicking a football), his dog - Snoopy and his group of childhood friends as they tackle the complexities of modern life: friendships, crushes, first loves, siblings and kicking a touchdown. This collection of 248 daily Peanuts newspaper strips that appeared between 1957 -1959, includes the strips where Charlie Brown revealed that his father was a barber and his mother was a housewife. The strip's bitter-sweet humour and child-like innocence helped to cement the Peanuts comic strip's popularity and secure its reputation as a true, one-of-a-kind, timeless classic.",
