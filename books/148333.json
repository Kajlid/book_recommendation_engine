  "description": "Pearls is the hottest comic in the newspaper business these days.\" - Raleigh News and ObserverNamed Best Comic Strip of the Year by the National Cartoonists Society in 2004 and 2007, Pearls Before Swine is regarded by fans and critics alike as a thoughtful commentary on humanity's pitiable plight.Stephan Pastis sketches this nuanced comic strip tale, which features the arrogant, self-centered, and totally hilarious Rat, who leads his four-legged friends through misadventure after misadventure. Joining him for the journey are Pig, the slow but good-hearted conscience of the strip; Goat, the voice of reason that often goes unheard; and Zebra and the eternally inept Crocodiles who pursue him. Together this mindful menagerie mocks the flaws and shortcomings of human nature through Pastis's cynically biting wit.* The third Pearls Before Swine treasury, this book combines all the cartoons from and , along with annotations by Pastis.* From courtroom antics to references of other cartoon strips, Pastis's strip is a fresh presence on the comic pages.",
