  "description": "A funny, funny tale of King Francis, the edgy king who has the power to transport the kingdom to a safe place in times of danger. Well, for Francis, danger was EVERYWHERE and his constituents were growing weary of finding the kingdom relocated after a day in the fields or out hunting. Gray is another of those great British authors who deal so wondrously well with fantasy and humor.",
