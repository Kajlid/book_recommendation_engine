  "description": "Six years ago, in the dead of night, I woke up to a cold bed and an even colder future without her. I would’ve followed her anywhere and she left. I thought I’d moved on and left all she meant to me behind. But a first love is never easy to forget. Even harder when I once felt our love is inevitable--inescapable. And I’ve been proven right once again. One night brings us back together and derails our lives. We’re sent on a collision course with a future apart and even scarier--a future together. I’m back basking in the warm glow of her gaze and burning with the unquenchable fire of her touch. We’ve walked this path before and our shattered hearts have been pieced back together. As easy as it would be to run again, I can’t stop wanting her.This is our final chance to have what we’ve always wanted--each other. Or it’ll be our ruin.The final book in the Fulton U universe sports romance, Falling trilogy.",
