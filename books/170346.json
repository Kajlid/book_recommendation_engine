  "description": "The Vietnam War was different from any other fought by the United States before. Young Americans eligible for the unpopular draft revolted, taking to the streets and in some cases fleeing their country. Lessons learned in organizing against the war were soon picked up by other constituents—namely, women.This short story, \"Strangers on a Plane\" from The Prometheus Saga, is set in 1969. During a flight across North America, a young mother traveling with her infant meets an elderly woman who displays unusual powers. But when a catastrophe threatens, are those powers strong enough to avert disaster? This short story folds into Kay Kendall’s mystery series that features the young woman, amateur sleuth Austin Starr. The debut book is DESOLATION ROW and RAINY DAY WOMEN launches in summer 2015. Both are from Stairway Press of Seattle. -- Visit Kay at www.kaykendallauthor.com",
