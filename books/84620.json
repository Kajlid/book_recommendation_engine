  "description": "What do a small-time card shark fresh out of the state foster system and a newly-expelled-from-college computer geek have in common? Desperation. And they live in apartments across the hall from each other. An ill-timed peek through a peephole and an impromptu omelet lead to a business venture that takes Charlie (she's the brawn) and Doug (he's the brains) into the strange worlds of bounty hunting and the supernatural.",
