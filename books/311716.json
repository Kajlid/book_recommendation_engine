  "description": "Santiago writes gay romance with tasteful erotic scenes, and a weekly series on WordPress titled \"Something Like Fate.\" He meets a friendly new fan in the comment section of his latest blog post, a reviewer of hardcore gay erotica with kinky and taboo themes. At first Santiago is turned off by the vulgar reviews, questionable themes, and porn retweets that make the reviewer seem like an oversexed horndog. Santiago's a Christian with traditional morals, and he prefers sex scenes to be implied and not explicit. However, he realizes he shouldn't judge and decides to give the reviewer a chance.They start chatting privately on Twitter and connect so well, Santiago is intrigued by this mysterious man named Gary. Their newfound connection quickly evolves into a long-distance friendship, which then becomes something that causes their feelings for each other to grow more intensely than theyâ€™re prepared for in a matter of days.During a steamy video chat, Gary reveals he lives a kinky lifestyle as a Dominant, and only a submissive can satisfy his relationship needs. He won't have it any other way. Santiago wonders if he wants to ignore his morals and get involved in a Dominant/submissive relationship. Can they make it work? Is Santiago willing to change his life for someone he barely knows?",
