  "description": "Coeur de Lion is a love poem.\"To try to write love is to confront the muck of that region of hysteria where language is both too much and too little , excessive (by the limitless expansion of the ego , by emotive submersion) and impoverished (by the codes on which love diminishes and levels it).{....}To know that one does not write for the other, to know that these things I am going to write will never cause me to be loved by the one I love (the other); to know that writing compensates for nothing, sublimates nothing, that it is precisely there where you are not -- this is the beginning of writing.\"-Roland Barthes, A Lover's Discourse . VIntage, 2002. Translation copyright Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Inc., 1978.",
