  "description": "It’s dangerous for a girl to be a mathematical prodigy in 18th-century Rome. Daniela Messo and her father withdraw themselves from the world until Giuseppe Balsamo finds them, convinced that Daniela has inherited the secrets of a long-dead Jewish mystic. Before long, they are playing the role of wonder-working pilgrims as they swindle their way across Europe en route to Jerusalem. Daniela’s struggle to find a woman’s place in the world for her body, mind, and soul tells us how far society has come and how far we still must go.",
