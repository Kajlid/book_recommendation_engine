For Alexandria, coming to terms with the immortal life she has agreed to embrace, while still holding on to herself, will call on all the internal and physical strength she has. Though her angelic father, Ganymede, intends for her to ease into the new body and life that has been created for her, his Fallen brother, Rangor, has other plans. And Alex has plans for Kronis as well. Plans that call for him to have one last chance to turn away from the life of sin and hate that his father cultivated in him for millennia. In a bid for peace, and in the hope to keep Alexandria alive, the Nephilim of the Light will have to charge ahead on a quest to find Kronis, before he and his father come for Alex again. And through the great struggles and battles to come, Alex must also decide to whom she will give her heart: Gaius or Jackson. Both so dear and precious to her, yet only one can truly lay claim to her heart as her husband. She will search her very soul to discover the one whom it cries out for, amidst the great danger swirling around all those she loves.",
