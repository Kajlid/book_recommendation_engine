So as she watches the stars flickering in the velvet night sky, she sees several shoot across the void and it’s then she makes A Wish.This is the first in a series of short stories based on the Lia Fail Chronicles. This is NOT a stand-alone short story. It is a continuation of the novel The Gathering.
