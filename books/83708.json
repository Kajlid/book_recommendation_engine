  "description": "Nice girls don’t have affairs- even anonymously.  For five years, Reese’s husband, Adam, has been everything she’s ever wanted: loving, protective, and the kind of husband other women wish for. Life is perfect. When Adam’s career takes off— Reese is left feeling more like a forgotten roommate than his lover. Feeling lost, confused, and more than a little down on herself, Reese turns to an unlikely source—an anonymous doctor with an internet sex blog. At first the dirty doctor is just a sexy distraction, but as their communication develops, so does their relationship. There’s no harm in an anonymous arrangement if both parties understand the rules… but one decision can change everything.",
