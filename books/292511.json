  "title": "Rated R Boy : Growing Up Korean in 1980s Queens",
  "description": "Life in NYC is nothing like what the protagonist imagined it would be before moving there in the summer of 1980. Instead of the idyllic life his family envisioned, the city throws nothing but curveballs at him. The city is filled with homeless people. The subway is covered in graffiti. The older boys on his block push him around and make him do things he doesn't want to. And, most alarming of all, his parents suddenly seem just as clueless as he is. Rated R Boy is a memoir about a boy who learns to navigate life at school, the streets, and two very unusual summer camps, even as he struggles to figure out what true courage is and where he and his family truly belong. It tells the story of a boy who learns many important lessons about what it means to be a man, an American, and a member of a family. Set in Elmhurst, Queens, NYC, this book is the third segment of Park's Elmhurst Trilogy, made up of Boy Genius, Las Cucarachas, and Rated R Boy.",
