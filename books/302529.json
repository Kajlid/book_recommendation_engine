  "description": "It all began in Rome…I was supposed to show Cole the city, as a favor to a friend. I was aware of his reputation, a seductive charmer hellbent on bachelorhood, but I hadn't prepared for him to get past my defenses. Cole was nothing like the serious businessman I imagined. He was sinfully hot, funny and way too flirty for my broken heart. But, it was just vacation after all. I thought I'd never see him again.Only I do.Cole calls me the very day I return to New York. My residency has been my sole focus for the past few years—my passion and my refuge. I've loved and lost and I don't know how to open up again. But Cole is melting my fears with every kiss and touch, willing to move mountains to make me happy and help me heal. And what scares me the most? I might just let him.",
