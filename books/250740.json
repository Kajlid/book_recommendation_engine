This tempestuous family is famous for scandal and legendary at love…Orphaned beauty Meg Amberley is caught in a snowstorm, and takes refuge at the estate of Lord Cade Byron. Haunted by his past, Cade has buried himself in the country. Then Meg—with her lush curves and soft, blonde hair—invades his house and his life. With her reputation compromised, he proposes a pretend engagement and a London Season where she can find a husband. But as their charade deepens, Cade can’t let her go . . . vowing to tempt her with a kiss that just may lead to forever.",
