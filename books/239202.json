  "description": "Garrett Wilder is rich, famous, and totally bad for me. After one night that ended with me wanting to punch him in his face, the self-absorbed rockstar has become a permanent fixture in my life... Whether I like it or not.  Now I’m forced to see him every day, and that shield I put up to protect my heart is quickly crumbling to the ground. I’ve gone from hating him to craving him. And the scariest part is that he feels the same.  He wants to know me. He wants to own me. He wants to corrupt me.  And if I’m not careful... I just might let him.  **AUTHOR NOTE** This book is the first in the Civil Corruption series, but can be read as a standalone. All Civil Corruption books will have their own happily ever afters.",
