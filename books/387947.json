  "title": "How to Save Your Own Life",
  "description": "Erica Jong--like Isadora Wing, her fictional doppelganger--was rich and famous, brainy and beautiful, and soaring high with erotica and marijuana in 1977, the year this book was first published. Erica/Isadora are the perfect literary and libidinous guides for those readers who want to learn about-or just be reminded of-the sheer hedonistic innocence of the time. \"How to Save Your Own Life\" was praised by \"People\" for being \"shameless, sex-saturated and a joy,\" and hailed by Anthony Burgess as one of the ninety-nine best novels published in English since 1939.",
