  "title": "Tempting Fate",
  "description": "Mia's lived in her sister's shadow long enough. Now that Abby is getting married to a Frenchman, Mia scents freedom. In fact, Jean DeLeon, the groom's too-charming cousin, seems like the perfect place to start. But the House of Lions is full of secrets, and what started out as an exciting fling is quickly becoming more frustration than fun. Mia wants answers, or she wants out, and it isn't like she doesnâ€™t have other options. Ethan Hastings, for example. Tall, handsome, and gray eyes like nothing she's ever seen before. The fact that Jean seems to hate him is just a bonus.(This novella takes place during the events of Forged by Fate).",
