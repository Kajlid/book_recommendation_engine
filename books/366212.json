  "title": "Tinseland: Christopher's Christmas Adventure",
  "description": "Tinseland is a modern day Christmas adventure story. Christopher is a young boy who has just been chosen by Santa Claus to help save Christmas. Join him on his perilous quest against the evil forces of Grimmire and his minions. On your journey you will meet memorable characters and experience a different twist to the traditional Christmas story. Will they succeed? A delight to both the young reader and parents creating memories, the fate of Christmas awaits Christopher, and you... Author's Note: I wrote the Tinseland story for my then eight-year-old son, and revised it when my daughter was old enough to enjoy. It has become a part of our Christmas tradition. Each chapter is short enough to read at bedtime and allows a 'cliffhanger' effect for the next reading. Many young readers, eager to find out what happens, end up reading it in a couple sessions. I hope you enjoy Tinseland and that it brings a little extra Christmas joy to you and your family. Micah",
