  "description": "Everyone knows I’m the good girl.I am Susannah, and I’m beautiful, accomplished, calm and polite. What they don’t know is that I’m also another girl, one who is hot-tempered, brave – and an expert at throwing knives.We settled in Dragoncourt, and I’m happier than I’ve ever been. Or, I would have been if it wasn’t for the dumb prophecy about the prosperous times which predicts that I’m bound by fate to Kee, the beautiful Dreughan Prince. The golden one. The only one who acutely dislikes me.Then disaster strikes and I have no choice but to let go of the good girl. I have to lie and deceive my way straight into Pantano, the stronghold of the Waterfolk, where I’m forced to do bad things in the name of love and fury. In the end, it’s time to decide; Am I the good girl or the wild one? Or can I be both?In the second book in the Dreughan trilogy, set in a medieval fantasy world from a thousand years ago, we follow Susannah through adventure and romance. It’s a story about daring to be yourself, and the lengths you will go to save the ones you love.The Dreughan trilogy can be read standalone, but it’s also the starting point for Ms. North’s Urban Fantasy series \"Birds of a Feather\".",
