  "description": "Jared Beckett gave up on love when love ruined him.I’m not one to mince words. I only have one use for females, being burned one too many times. Hit it and quit it. Now, get out of my life. I wasn’t always this way. In high school, I was somewhat shy, but I thought I met The One, my driver’s ed. partner. She was my every waking thought until she stomped on my heart, destroying me. I’ve never recovered.Returning to Annapolis twelve years after graduation to temporarily live with my dad is no joy, especially when my past heartache slams into me, drudging up the bitterness. However, I’m an expert at building walls, figurative and literal. Yet, finding out she never learned to drive because of an accident years ago, I nearly break my neck offering to teach her. Giving her the keys ensures I’m in control this time, even if it’s not in the actual driver’s seat. It’s not an invitation to my life, but my bed or, hell, my back seat, nailing her to get my once and done and never again, no matter how much she begs for more. I want her to hurt like she crushed me. Juvenile, maybe, but she created this vengeful monster, and my payback is overdue.The Keys to Jericho was chosen as an \"Official Selection\" in the Romance category of Apple Literary's 2017 Annual Book Awards.",
