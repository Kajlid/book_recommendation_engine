  "description": "The coast has always been a place of beauty and healing. The salt air blows away the details of daily life, and the rhythm of the waves soothes something deep inside. Ann Campanella’s mother passed away in 2007 after 14 years of living with Alzheimer’s. During a series of retreats at the beach, Ann found the time to embrace memories of her mother and discover herself again. This collection shares the story of her journey from grief to joy.",
