  "description": "If your deepest desires spontaneously manifested into reality, giving you powers and abilities once limited to your dreams, what would you do?Donovan Cole hates his life: his body, his job, his relationship…until one night a violent confrontation outside a nightclub causes him to change – instantly infusing him with almost supernatural size and strength.The transformation is only temporary, and before long he realizes that he’s not the only one; people around the world have been manifesting at random, able to bend the laws of physics that govern our universe…but they’re rarely seen or heard from again.Who, or what, is causing them to disappear? What’s the trigger that causes someone to change? And is it arbitrary when someone manifests their powers?Cole is drawn to a beautiful but troubled girl named Dia who is looking for similar answers, but has a solution to the unreliable nature of their unstable powers: an experimental drug known as ‘Muse’ that enables the user to trigger their abilities and transform at will.Battling a powerful and mysterious faction known as The Collectors – as well as their own addictions – Dia, Cole, and a small group of friends race against time to unravel the secrets of their uncanny abilities…but they may not live long enough to find out.",
