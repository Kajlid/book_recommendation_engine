  "description": "\"Threads of Destiny\" is the book from which all of Arnette Lamb's characters originated, and \"Romantic Times\" gives it the highest rating saying, \"You'll laugh and cry as you are drawn into this rich romance filled with marvelous characters\".Lady Suisan Harper couldn't take her eyes from the dangerously attractive man whose presence filled the candlelit room—Myles Cunningham. She had expected a weakling; he was strong. She had expected cold indifference; he drew her to him with a hot and hungry look. But of course he believed she was only Maura, a saucy maid happy to share a wealthy man's bed.Handsome or not, Myles had nearly driven her family's weaving business to ruin. He had even stolen the patterns for her family's clan tartans, symbols of Scottish independence outlawed by the English king. Suisan had come to London willing to risk her honor and her freedom to get them back. But now, as Myles' lips brushed hers with fire, her carefully woven thread of lies began to unravel...and a silken strand of desire began binding her destiny to this irresistible man—her enemy and her beloved.",
