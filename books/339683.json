  "description": "The sinfully sexy MacKade brothers are back! New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts's reader favorites are once again breaking the hearts of women everywhere. Sheriff Devin MacKade watched -- patiently, painfully -- as the woman he secretly cherished suffered through a less-than-perfect marriage. Now pretty Cassie Connor was free . . .but vulnerable.

One beautiful lady didn't mean The Fall of Shane MacKade (1996) from bachelorhood was a sure thing. But it was definitely a possibility . . .",
