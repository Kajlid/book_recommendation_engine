  "description": "Scorch is a cocky apprentice at the Guardians' Guild, a fellowship of warriors trained to protect the people of Viridor. But when his first guardianship turns out to be more treacherous than he'd bargained for, Scorch finds himself in league with an unlikely companionâ€”the mysterious Vivid, a man as attractive as he is ill-tempered. Assassins, monsters, and fearsome elementals await them on their quest to save the High Priestess, but the greatest danger of all may lie in the discovery of Scorch's darkest secret.",
