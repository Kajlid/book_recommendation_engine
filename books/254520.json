  "description": "Traveling to New Zealand to study abroad is the most adventurous thing twenty-year-old Wendy has done. But she gets more than she bargained for when a hike through the countryside mysteriously transports her to an island in Neverland, the vast sea on an archaic earth-like planet. While struggling to come to terms with the impossible, Wendy is taken hostage by Captain Hook and his crew on board the Jolly Roger. As the ship casts off and sails into the horizon, home has never felt so appealingâ€”or seemed so far away.Her fortunes change when she escapes and teams up with Peter, a roguish young sailor, to outrun Hook and find the means to go back to her loved ones left behind. But as Wendy and Peter's adventures unfold, their friendship turns into something more.Faced with cursed treasure maps, sea-witches, and blood-thirsty pirates, Wendy could never have predicted what will become the greatest challenge of all. How will she bring herself to leave Peter behind?",
