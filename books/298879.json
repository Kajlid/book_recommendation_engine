  "description": "From New York Times Bestseller Mimi Jean Pamfiloff comes BRUTUS, a Paranormal Romantic Comedy that will surely cause evil vampires to kidnap the author.CAN THE WORLD’S TOUGHEST IMMORTAL WARRIOR WIN THE HEART OF THE WORLD’S TOUGHEST IMMORTAL WOMAN?Brutus is not your average immortal warrior. He leads the gods’ army, he’s tough as nails, and his mind is so powerful, he no longer speaks to communicate with his men. Some call him telepathic; he just calls it being a badass.But despite the many bloody battles and hard-won victories, this is one mission he’s not so sure about. There is a plague sweeping the immortal world. Gods, vampires, incubi—no one is safe, except for those with mates, and sadly, there just aren’t enough women to go around.To keep the gods’ army intact, ready to protect the human world, Brutus must convince a group of ancient female warriors, located deep in the Amazon jungle, to return home with him, and…well…go on dates with his men.But when the toughest, meanest, man-hating, sexiest woman of the group catches his eye, all he can think about is conquering her heart. WARNING: This book contains a smokin’ hot immortal warrior looking for his forever love, a randy invisible unicorn, and bad, bad, such bad language. Okay, and some sex. Fine, yes! Lots of sex! And a kitten, a bit of violence, a man who loves knitting, mannibalism, unruly deities, Mayan priests who babysit animals, a naked goddess who wears a bee bikini, leather pants (for men), a very randy ghost who’s desperate for her HEA, anecdotes about evil mermen, a BIG plot twist even the author didn’t see coming, and a ton of romancy kind of stuff.",
