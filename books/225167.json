  "description": "Jordan Sullivan’s pregnancy seems like the perfect cure for her loneliness. In fact, it feels like God’s way of saying “sorry” for allowing her parents’ murders. That belief not only explains how a virgin like Jordan can be pregnant, it makes the news she’s expecting twins feel like poetic justice. But it isn’t long before Jordan realizes her pregnancy isn’t entirely a Godsend.From the moment they’re born, the twins become common denominators of mysterious tragedies. Jordan struggles to rationalize the irrational until she meets Tanas. He horrifies her with the news that her babies are the fourth generation of a line-breeding experiment Tanas started with the Nazi Angel of Death, Josef Mengele.Tanas will soon force Jordan to make a terrible choice if she is to keep her sons alive – unless she can find another way.",
