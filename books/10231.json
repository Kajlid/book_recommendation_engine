  "title": "The Murder of Adolf Hitler: The Truth About the Bodies in the Berlin Bunker",
  "description": "Since the end of World War II, it has become widely accepted that Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun died together in a suicide pact as Soviet armies entered Berlin. The man whose monstrous ambitions began the war did not sign the German surrender, nor was he brought to justice at the Nuremberg trials. Instead, the Allies were presented with a set of charred remains, mysteriously missing one foot. Next to him was the body, also burned, of a woman wrapped in one of Eva Braun's dresses. Although the woman had died from shrapnel wounds to the chest, a capsule containing cyanide had been placed in her mouth and forcibly broken; her jaw was then closed. It was supposed to look like suicide. It was supposed to be Eva Braun. It was neither. It is now possible to reconstruct the events that led to the horrific scenario in the bunker. Using previously unavailable material from the archives of the Soviet authorities who captured Berlin and first investigated the deaths, and drawing upon a wide range of personal, medical, and forensic testimony, Hugh Thomas reveals exactly what took place as the inevitability of German defeat became apparent and the command structure of the Third Reich collapsed.",
