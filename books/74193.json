  "description": "At twenty-nine, Jane Knoll is convinced that she will never experience her first kiss. Bullied as a teenager, she lives life under a veil of insecurity and loneliness. Her social life consists of television reruns and a weekly laundry night with her neighbor, Larry. Then, hope rises when Jane starts following her beautiful, magnetic co-worker Eva on Twitter. Under the protective disguise of an alter ego, Jane experiences the joy of flirting and the rush of euphoria. Eva and Jane quickly launch into an online love affair that brings out the best in Jane. Behind the safety of her laptop screen, she becomes confident and empowered with purpose and talent. But face-to-face, Jane is nothing more than Eva’s nondescript, clumsy co-worker—a social catastrophe. For the first time in her life, Jane has discovered true bliss—happiness in love, newfound success in a writing career, and the chance to make a difference in the world. But can she live the rest of her life as an alter ego? Is she brave enough to reveal her true identity and risk squandering it all?",
