  "title": "The Ubiquitous masquereade",
  "description": "A collection of short stories exploring the themes of alienation, the search for personal authenticity and the ultimate nature of humankind. The tales frequently give the impression of supernatural events unfolding, using them as a metaphor for wider significances. With their supernatural imagery, brooding melancholy and bursts of grotesque, wry humour, one might describe them as a collection of fairy tales for the modern age.",
