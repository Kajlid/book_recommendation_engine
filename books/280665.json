  "description": "Loving your tormentor isn’t easy, especially when they collect broken hearts and parade them around like trophies. They’re the bad boys, the alpha a**holes, and the thorns in our sides. They push us past our limits, turn us on, and break us. They’re our bullies. They’re the class of 2020. Eight bestselling authors are teaming up to bring you eight unique stories about the guys we love to hate. This anthology benefits one of the largest anti-bullying organizations in the world, and all proceeds will go toward helping to support victims of bullying. Note from the authors Bully Me: Class of 2020 is a collection of novellas that includes a mix of standalones and prequels that will later be expanded upon.
