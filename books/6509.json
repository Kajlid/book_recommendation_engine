  "title": "Sex: How to Get More of It: A guyâ€™s roadmap to paradise, in and out of the bedroom",
  "description": "How can you make your woman happy and also get what you need? Believe it or not, it's not impossible! And it doesn't cost more than a couple of bucks here and there--no trips to Italy or expensive jewelry required.  In this handbook, which I've kept intentionally short and to-the-point, you will get insight into how women think so that you can speak and behave in a way that will reignite her passion for you. To help you with this I've come up with THE LIST which contains 20 easy things you can do to make your relationship happier, more peaceful, and full of love, romance and sex.  Ultimately, women want to feel safe, loved, appreciated and cherished. I'm going to give you the tools you need to help her feel exactly that.  Enjoy the handbook and I hope it helps bring you and your girl joy that will last a lifetime. PS: Just wanted to give you all fair warning... this book gets down to brass tacks. It's mouthy, sometimes sarcastic and (gasp!) uses an occasional cuss word, but it is also very much from the heart. If you are delicate in nature, be prepared. But if you just want the honest truth about how to be happier with your woman, and don't mind a little feistiness in the process, you are in the right place.",
