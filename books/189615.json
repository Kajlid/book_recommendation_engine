  "description": "\"Round, and round, his voice went, and through it came a noise. It was low and vibrant, like wind in a chimney. It grew louder, more taut, and the wall blurred, and the floor shook. The noise was in the fabric of the church: it pulsed with sound. Then he heard a heavy door open; and close; and the noise faded away. It was now too still in the church, and the footsteps were moving over the rubble in the passage downstairs.'Who's that?' said Roland.The footsteps reached the stairs, and began to climb.\"From that chilling moment, Roland was precipitated into the twilight world of Elidor, where the powers of evil had all but extinguished the last remaining glimmer of light and hope.",
