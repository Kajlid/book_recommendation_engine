  "description": "“From the Mundane to the Magical is an ambitious poetic history written by an author who sincerely appreciates each facet life enshrines. Touching on war, environmental issues, modern technology, and our ever-changing world, Chappell is a generous author whose honesty is tangible. Readers are taken on a magic carpet ride from Alaska to the Mediterranean, Asia, and beyond. Captured here is the true essence of culture, people, and animals from all edges of the world. Nuances of rose quartz, Dickinson, and Parker are present in the poems written and inspired by the many experiences of love and loss, which truly inspire an open mind and heart. And, if that wasn’t enough for the average reader, the magic abounds with a series of folkloric poetry to set the imagination afire.” - Apryl Skies, A Song Beneath the Silence",
