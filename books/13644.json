  "description": "The Sackett boys weren't out to make a reputation; it just happened that way. They had crossed Black Fetchen and lived to tell about it. Now Fetchen was coming for them with the most expensive hired guns in the country. But the Sacketts were no strangers to trouble. They knew what guns were and how to use them, and one thing was sure: when the showdown came, the Sacketts would be ready, and someone was going to die.",
