  "description": "Bogan County, Colorado, 1877. A small band of marauding Comanche (the scourge of the plains) raped, scalped, disemboweled, and cut out the tongues of every man, woman and child they found in the valley. A mountain man witnessed everything as best he could through the cover of darkness and reported it to the local sheriff, however, the town drunk happened to overhear the conversation and told everyone in the town saloon, which eventually led to a drunken revenge spree. They went down by the rivers edge where a friendly tribe of Chyenne were camped and killed everyone under the pretense that an injun was an injun.The Chyenne worshiped the wolf. and after a plea from the Chyenne chief before he died, asking that the whiteman pay for his deed if none of the tribe survived, it was the wolves who took revenge on mankind for the useless slaughter of their bloodbrothers. The revenge didn't end until over a hundred years had passed when it was found that there had been a lone survivor.",
