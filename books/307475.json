  "description": "Around here, football isn't a game. It's a manifestation of our basest instincts, an excuse to yell and hit and, regardless of whether we win or lose, drink. For Levi, it's even less of a game. It's a gateway out of a life marked by addiction, abuse, and poverty. At least until he meets Charlie, who, like every beautiful, enigmatic girl to catch a high school boy's eye, completely upends Levi's world. Levi and Charlie's story is a harrowing one of desperation, yearning, and ultimately, devastation.",
