  "title": "The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark",
  "description": "Plop, the Baby Barn Owl, is like every Barn Owl there ever was, except for one thingâ€”he is afraid of the dark. \"Dark is nasty\" he says, and so he won't go hunting with his parents. Mrs. Barn Owl sends him down from his nest-hole to ask about the dark and he meets a little boy waiting for the fireworks to begin, an old lady, a scout out camping, a girl who tells him about Father Christmas, a man with a telescope, and a black cat who takes him exploring. He realizes through these encounters that dark is super after all.",
