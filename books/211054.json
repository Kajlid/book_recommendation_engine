  "description": "In the glorious days when the young tough citizens of a young and tough America pushed their frontiers westward through Kentucky, an Indian fighter and woodsman could outrank a college-educated aristocrat from Virginia. Adam Frame was one of those men- a man who lived on war. Woodsman, pioneer, soldier, he had followed George Rogers Clark in his expeditions against the British-inspired Indians; he had fought at the great victories of Kaskaskia and Vincennes. And now he was ready to claim the warrior's reward for which he had waited nine long years- a position of leadership in a pioneer settlement and Cynthia, the poised, confident woman of Virginia, who had sweetened a thousand wilderness dreams.",
