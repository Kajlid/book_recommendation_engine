  "description": "The Alpha Wolves Motorcycle Club President wants me for his old lady.Like that could ever happen.Royal McBride is a total a-hole. He's rude, impulsive, and the rest of his club hates me. Of course, the man in question has a lethal swagger, a sinful smirk, and a British accent that melts my lacy crotchless panties. Plus, the guy's got timber wolves as pets and lives in a Victorian house by the sea.How could I say no to that?But I can never forget that he's the head of a criminal organization that's in trouble with both the FBI and a rival MC. If I thought things were bad before, they're about to get worse. Danger is in his job description; outlaw is his whole life.A turf war between two clubs is no place for the mayor's daughter; in the tattooed arms of the man in charge feels exactly like where I belong.Falling into bed with him was a big mistake; falling in love with him could be deadly.A motorcycle club president â€¦ an aspiring politician.There's no way in hell this is going to work..",
