She meant to make a statement, but she never dreamed the entire nation would get caught up in the controversy. As if becoming nationally recognized as “Virgin Val” isn’t enough, Val’s already hectic life starts to spin wildly out of control when bad boy Kyle Hamilton, lead singer for the hit rock band Tralse, decides to take her abstinence as a personal challenge.How can a girl stay true to herself when this year’s Sexiest Man Alive is doing everything in his power to win her over?",
