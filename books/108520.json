  "description": "In the tenth book of the series perfect for Dork Diaries and Wimpy Kid fans, this dragon will storm a castle, battle a knight, and stand up to any bully!  What does Danny Dragonbreath do when his super-annoying cousin Spencer gets kidnapped by knights? First, he thinks about how nice and quiet Thanksgiving would be without Spencer. Then, of course, Danny goes off to rescue him, with his cohorts Wendell and Christiana by his side. Their action-packed mission involves a dirty dungeon, a very squelchy moat, a big surprise for Christiana . . . and jousting galore! The hilarious Dragonbreath series matches up classic middle grade humor with comic panels. It's guaranteed to make you laugh until smoke comes out of your nose!",
