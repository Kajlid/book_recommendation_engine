  "description": "\"Dreyfus writes with the darkly absurd humour of a thirsty and somewhat paranoid Jonathan Swift\" - Pop MattersJake Miller has just been shot by a member of the British Counterterrorism Unit. As he lies on his bedroom floor, wondering if he’s going to bleed out, he attempts to put the last few months of his life into perspective. One minute he’s starting a high-flying job in the corporate banking sector; the next minute he’s commanding a legion of disaffected computer users known as Generation Y-bother. They know Jake only by his hacking name Spark and the videos he uploads to his Youtube account, but they’re determined to help him bring about the end of the world as we know it. The problem is not everybody’s on board his battleship…Spark is Rupert's debut novel which takes a swipe at corporate culture and the Westminster pantomime. A thank you letter to hacktivist groups such as Anonymous; this is guerrilla fiction for the Digital Age.",
