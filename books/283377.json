  "title": "Malachi",
  "description": "A legend among his own kind…even among the Hunters, Malachi was unique. He always had been… from the beginning. Once a slave, Malachi hadn’t ever lived free, until a mysterious woman turned him into something he didn’t understand. At first he fights it, seeing it as a different kind of bondage. Then he realizes it is his destiny. Embracing that destiny could lead to freedom-or it could lead him into an endless hell. Author’s note: This is the story of how Malachi was Changed and how he was led to the Hunters~ although his future mate is alluded to, this isn’t their story. It’s Malachi’s story, or at least, the beginning of it.",
