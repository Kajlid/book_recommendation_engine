  "title": "This Wonderful Year: The Adventures of Mr. Edward Pamprill",
  "description": "Featured in the 2015 WISCONSIN BOOK FESTIVAL. \"A treasure of a novel\"--Steve Donoghue, contributor to The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and The Boston Globe. THIS WONDERFUL YEAR harkens back to the great historical novels of the United Kingdom (think Patrick O'Brian, Jane Austen, Robert Louis Stevenson), yet it reads as fresh as the most contemporary of literary offerings. It is the year 1805, and a weary England prepares for Napoleon's next move. Events don't seem to bother Mr. Edward Pamprill, however; he's too busy spending his father's money and living a life of idle pleasure. The good times are cut short when his father (the lecherous Baron Pamprill) secretly arranges for his son's abduction and removal to a British man-of-war, and it is at sea that young Mr. Pamprill truly begins his education. The culture, philosophy, and political climate of the period are captured in vivid detail. The reader will thrill as Mr. Pamprill battles Napoleon, endures raging storms, and struggles to keep alive the passion for the mystery woman he left behind while his heart is besieged by some of the era's most beautiful and dangerous women. A truly one-of-a-kind work from one of fiction's newest and most compelling voices. Edited by Dorian DeMichele.",
