  "description": "Harvey Jones goes to Spain to work as an interim headmaster at a small American private school. They have only hired him for one year since he doesnâ€™t have much experience. He expects to work hard to prove himself. He is also looking forward to getting to know the country that his late brother had loved. What Harvey does not expect is to be thwarted and sabotaged at every turn by teachers who are against him right from the beginning. In spite of his escalating challenges at work, though, Harvey falls in love and decides to convince the board to extend his contract. Set in the lovely city of Santander, on the Bay of Biscay, Bueno is a spellbinding novel, very well-written and hard to put down.",
