  "description": "Fourteen-year-old Jack Morgan has been through a lot. His parents died years ago, and since his Uncle Virgil was killed, Jack has been alone. But he does have a friend now, named Draycos . . . if you can call a golden-scaled draconic K'da poet-warrior a friend.The two friends both have scores to settle. Draycos must find and expose those behind a vast conspiracy against his people, and Jack is desperate to thwart the men who framed him for a crime he didn't commit. Alone, Draycos, who must bond with a host or die, is dead; Jack, on his own, is sunk. Together, they might have a chance. Especially when Draycos, who can slip onto Jack's skin like a living tattoo, uses some of his special talents. They know mercenaries helped launch the ambush that destroyed Draycos's advance team, but when Jack joined up with one such group to get information on the identities of those involved, he and Draycos were nearly killed before they escaped--empty-handed. They also know an alien Brummga was involved. Now, the only way they can get the information they need is for Uncle Virge to \"sell' Jack into slavery on a rich Brummga's estate . . . and hope he can crack their computer without getting caught.Jack thought the mercenary life was hard, until he met Brummgan slavemaster Grazen and tasted life in his high-security compound. If he and Draycos can just survive the experience, they might find a clue that can help in their quests for justice.Contains:Dragon and ThiefDragon and SoldierDragon and Slave",
