  "title": "Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion",
  "description": "Man Is Not Alone is a profound, beautifully written examination of the ingredients of piety: how man senses God's presence, explores it, accepts it, and builds life upon it. Abraham Joshua Heschel's philosophy of religion is not a philosophy of doctrine or the interpretation of a dogma. He erects his carefully built structure of thought upon foundations which are universally valid but almost generally ignored. It was Man Is Not Alone which led Reinhold Niebuhr accurately to predict that Heschel would \"become a commanding and authoritative voice not only in the Jewish community but in the religious life of America.\" With its companion volume, God in Search of Man, it is revered as a classic of modern theology.",
