  "description": "When David and his brother Ben traveled from southern California to Texas to take care of their recently deceased father’s estate, they had no idea the kind of adventure they would be drawn into when a red Ferrari soared past them on a long stretch of blazing Arizona highway. The hands of fate pulled the Ferrari’s driver, Angela, and David together as David risked his life to save her from an elite squad of government commandos that had been chasing her across the country. She had no idea what they wanted, but they were out for blood and she – and David – were not going to let them have it. With the help of a rogue commando, Robert, they make their way to Angela’s father’s secret home in Louisiana where they find something beyond anything they could have ever dreamed. Having learned the reason for their pursuer’s efforts, they embark on a wild adventure of epic proportions, from Earth, to the Moon, and far, far beyond in an effort to keep the human seed alive in the Universe.",
