  "description": "Once again the negligible, him gives condensation to an expository text that was developed of the internal monologue, justifiable by the facts. This laconic narrative in prose of non-fiction, is composed of 6 stories written in a apathetic state, arbitrarily ordered, in rectilinear, an exquisite selection of expressions in which are established among them an unexpressed simile, with the best aspects of the pluperfect, immaculate by a grotesque comedy, and with the inanimate world. From this succinct narrative, the self-ethnographic concept is complemented by a book titled: \"Excessive cruelty 2013 (A reality built to pieces)\".",
