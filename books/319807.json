  "description": "“Over the past two years, I’ve gone from bedbound, to housebound, to slowly venturing into the outside world. Writing down my innermost thoughts throughout each stage – holding nothing back – this book will take you on the journey with me, showcasing the challenges and joy along the way.A continuation of growth and healing, I hope these words can remind you that life is neither light or dark but a tentative mixture of both. And I hope that by being open and vulnerable, you can find some strength, solace, and light amongst these pages.” Written from the heart, this book of poetry and prose is split into three parts: Underground, Emerging, and Blooming. Presented chronologically, this book is an intimate witness to the ups and downs of recovery.",
