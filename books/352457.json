  "title": "Colorblind: The Rise of Post-Racial Politics and the Retreat from Racial Equity",
  "description": "\"It's a great book. I highly, highly, highly recommend it.\" --Tavis SmileyIn this powerful follow-up to Between Barack and a Hard Place, Tim Wise argues against “colorblindness” and for a deeper color-consciousness in both public and private practice. We can only begin to move toward authentic social and economic equity through what Wise calls \"illuminated individualism\"—acknowledging the diverse identities that have shaped our perceptions, and the role that race continues to play in the maintenance of disparities between whites and people of color in the United States today. This is the first book to discuss the pitfalls of “colorblindness” in the Obama era.",
