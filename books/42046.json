  "description": "In a darkened warehouse in Colombia, a father of two and the second highest-ranking executive in one of the largest oil companies in the world is murdered in what the company claims is a botched kidnapping attempt. Three thousand miles away, on a rock wall in New Mexico, a renowned environmental scientist and experienced climber falls to his death. The two deaths are linked by a deadly conspiracy to conceal a discovery that could end global warming, bring oil companies to their knees, and change the balance of power and wealth in the world overnight. When 33-year-old Nathan Robbins refuses to accept his company's implausible account of the death of his mentor and friend, he's risks everything he's worked for all his life. Determined to uncover the truth, he follows a lead that takes him to New Mexico where he discovers he has to rely on the help of Jessica Adams, an attractive environmentalist who despises the Big Oil that he represents. Trapped between his company's greedy CEO and a ruthless United States Senator, they race against time, following a trail that takes them from high in the wilderness to the heart of the U.S. Senate. But first they must find the key at the birthplace of the most powerful force the world has ever known-and stay alive to tell their story.",
