  "title": "Life a la Henri: Being the Memories of Henri Charpentier",
  "description": "Life la Henri is the delightful memoir-with-recipes of Henri Charpentier, the world's first celebrity chef. First published in 1934, and back in print after nearly six decades, the book traces Henri's career from his days as a scrap of a bellboy on the French Riviera and a quick-witted apprentice in a three-star kitchen (when he invented crepe suzette) to his sailing for New York to open his renowned namesake restaurants that introduced many to the glories of haute cuisine. Life la Henri is a memorable portrait of a top-flight restaurant kitchen, and is food writing of surpassing charm and taste. This edition includes a new Introduction by Alice Waters, owner and proprietor of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, and author of many cookbooks.",
