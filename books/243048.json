  "description": "England 1923 and the Great War still casts a dark shadow over the lives of ordinary people. Grieving widow, Helen Morrow and her husband’s cousin, the wounded and reclusive Paul, are haunted not only by the horrors of the trenches but ghosts from another time and another conflict. The desperate voice of a young woman reaches out to them from the pages of a coded diary and Paul and Helen are bound together in their search for answers, not only to the old mystery but also the circumstances surrounding the death of Helen’s husband at Passchandaele in 1917. As the two stories become entwined, Paul and Helen will not find peace or happiness until the mysteries are solved.**This is a revised edition and includes a never before published Epilogue**",
