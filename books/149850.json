  "description": "The third, and long awaited book in the Keeping Her Series. Lucas Gibbs walked away from Miley Isabella Rose years ago for her own safety. Then was forced to mourn and regret the choice when she died unexpectedly. Only she isn't dead. Miley is alive and has good reason to keep Lucas at a distance. But he's not about to blow this second chance to claim his mate. No matter what she says... or who he has to kill to keep her safe. This book is intended for mature audiences only. Definitely has explicit sex. This is a stand alone book but is better enjoyed within the series order.",
