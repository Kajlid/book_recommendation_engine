  "description": "Without verbs, where would a story go? NOWHERE. Characters, animals, and nature can’t be or do anything without a verb. Characters can’t laugh, animals can’t attack, and trees can’t sway in the breeze. Verbs provide excitement, drive the narrative and paint vivid pictures.Why say, she looked, if she can gawk, spy, or examine? Looked offers vague action, where the alternatives show action and expression. The right verb choice can illustrate the character’s state of mind, his mood, as well as physical characteristics.Inside this book, you’ll find stronger choices listed in alphabetical order for everyday verbs such as enter, walk, ran, took, etc. This quick reference will help you use more descriptive verbs to convey better images in the reader’s mind.",
