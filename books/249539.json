  "title": "Love and Freindship",
  "description": "When a noble youth arrives unannounced to request the hand of the matchless Laura, it seems their future is one of contentment and bliss - that is until his family learn of the marriage and, one by one, they reject the new bride. So begins a series of unspeakable events that Laura must confront and overcome, by way of the occasional fainting fit and bout of delirium.Tragedy and comedy here go hand in hand as a very foolish young heroine is placed at the centre of Jane Austen's early satire on drawing-room society. Written as a series of letters, \"Love and Friendship\" is a delicious romp through the highs and lows of a young girl's lot in life and a precursor of Austen's later works of genius.",
