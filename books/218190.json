  "title": "Portions from a Wine-Stained Notebook: Uncollected Stories and Essays, 1944-1990",
  "description": "One of the most outrageous and controversial figures of 20th-century American literature, Charles Bukowski was so prolific that many of his writings were never collected during his lifetime. Here is a substantial selection of these wide-ranging works, most of which have been unavailable since their original appearance in underground newspapers, literary journals, even porn magazines. Among the highlights are his first published short story, his last short story, his first and last essays, and the first installment of his famous \"Notes of a Dirty Old Man\" column. This landmark collection also contains meditations on his familiar themes, as well as singular discussions of such figures as Artaud, Pound, and Hemingway, and several discussions of his aesthetics, revealing an unexpectedly learned mind behind his seemingly offhand productions.",
