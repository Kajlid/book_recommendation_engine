These recognitions were celebrated during the ADL Centennial Gala. Reviews: \"Her narratives reflects a positive attitude and touches the hearts of all.\" \"Echoes and Reflections\" - Anti-Defamation League. \"If someone is being bullied or marginalized, she says: 'Step in, Be a Hero. Don't stay silent. Speak out. This takes guts, but it is what we must do as people.\" - University of New Haven. \"She was driven by a relentless need to survive so that she could share her story and ensure that the nightmare of prejudice and violence would never happen again.\" - Josh Sayles, The Weston Forum - \"Anita Shorr has come forward to tell her incredible story as she survived the concentration camps during the Holocaust. It is her goal to ensure history does not repeat itself by sharing history's example of its most extreme form of bullying.\" Kirsten Schuder, M.S., Contributor.",
