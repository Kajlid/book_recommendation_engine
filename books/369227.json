Aaron Sparx knows what women want, great sexy reads.“Hello there, my mistress,” he said with a low, honey-sultry voice. He bowed. “Thank you for summoning me. I am here to serve your every want and need until you grow tired of me and release me on your will.”Sara licked her lips. She might just want to keep him around for an eternity. Still in a daze of disbelief and wonderment, Sara made her way toward him with careful, almost Parkinsonian-steps. Then she stared into his eyes that reflected an image of her. She looked at his highly-kissable lips and sculpted jaw-line. His Adam’s apple bobbed. He smelled like cedar wood and spices, with a hint of manly scent that came from acute sweating.Phantoms could sweat?He breathed and his body emitted warmth. And yet he had no shadow beneath the streetlights and the moon. Sara touched his face. Warm. She blinked. He took her hand and kissed it. The entire length of Sara’s spine tingled with delight. She sucked in her breath.“I am here to serve your every want and need, my lovely mistress. What would you like me to do next?”Sara pulled her hand away from the Phantom Lover and ran into her house, a plethora of feelings consuming her, from disbelief, fear, to arousal. Never in her life had she wanted to strip her clothes and make love to a stranger like so before. Right on her front lawn, hard and fast, and not caring if the neighbors see her humping the air.",
