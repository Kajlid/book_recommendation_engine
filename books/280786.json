Perfect for fans of Loreth Anne White or C.J. Box, Don’t Come Home will leave you breathless.Her town is missing, but she’s not alone. When scrappy college freshman Leigh Mae Montgomery gets a cryptic postcard from her estranged mother telling her “Don’t come home”, she immediately heads from Harvard to Blackriver, Wyoming; the dying rural town she once called home. With Henry - a handsome but privileged classmate who also happens to be blackmailing her – by her side, Leigh makes her way back to Blackriver, only to find that her entire isolated town – and the people in it – are missing. Leigh, terrified for her parents and doubting her own sanity, is forced to quickly unravel the mysterious occurrences that led up to the disappearance of Blackriver.Most troubling is that Leigh can’t seem to shake the feeling that even though they are isolated, they are definitely not alone. Someone - or something - is watching them grow ever closer to the truth…and each other. Stranger Things meets Longmire in this atmospheric tale of isolation, new love and terror set against the decline of rural America. With just a touch of the paranormal, Don’t Come Home is a story that will stay with readers for a long time, and introduces Bea Bledsoe as a major new voice in paranormal thrillers.",
