  "description": "As nuclear war looms, a probe has discovered an Earthlike planet waiting with open biosphere; and the Americans launch a crash project to colonize Chiron. Science can't yet transport living humans between stars, but it can send DNA codes to become children who will be raised by humanlike robots. Amazingly, it works. The colonists are everything their home-planet could hope for--except that they really mean it about all that liberty stuff. But now the Earthmen have had their war, survived, rebuilt--and sent ships to Chiron. They're the government. They've come to help. But the colonials have such an attitude.",
