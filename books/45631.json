  "description": "'New York Times' best selling author William R. Forstchen now brings us a story which can be all too terrifyingly real . . a story in which one man struggles to save his family and his small North Carolina town after America loses a war, in one second, a war that will send America back to the Dark Age. . .A war based upon a weapon, an Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP). A weapon that may already be in the hands of our enemies.Months before publication, 'ONE SECOND AFTER' has already been cited on the floor of Congress as a book all Americans should read/listen to, a book already being discussed in the corridors of the Pentagon as a truly realistic look at a weapon and its awesome power to destroy the entire United States, literally within one second. It is a weapon that 'The Wall Street Journal' warns could shatter America. In the tradition of 'On the Beach'. 'Fail Safe' and 'Testament', this book, set in a typical American town, is a dire warning of what might be our future . . . and our end. . .RUNNING TIME ⇒ 13hrs. and 17mins.©2009 William R. Forstchen (P) Blackstone Audio, Inc.",
