  "description": "“Feuerverger’s search for a “place of inner solace” is profoundly inspiring … often rendered in poetically stirring prose. With affecting clarity, the author meditates on the ways in which trauma is transmitted generationally…This is a powerful story, conveyed with deep humanity and insight.” –Kirkus ReviewsA child of Holocaust survivors, Grace was always searching for shelter but knew that her home was the last place where she could find it. She was eager to be out there in the world, but at every turn had to battle the demons which permeated her home – hissing their frightening, grim messages. Montréal offered Grace the chance of a lifetime. She was four years old when she discovered the joie-de-vivre of her French-Canadian neighbors in the working-class east end of her beloved city. As she grew older other serendipitous “rescues” arrived in surprising ways in many different places. Vivid and lyrical, Winter Light is a deeply moving memoir dedicated to all who are coming from places of trauma. It is about the vast unknown territory of the human heart, where love and hope can rise above everything – in spite of the ghosts that still haunt us.",
