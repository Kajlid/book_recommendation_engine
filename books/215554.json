  "description": "The women who were born during the passing of the Great Star possessed strange powers, which often they themselves did not understand. As they came of age, they found themselves estranged from their villages and even their families. But as they were driven out of their childhood homes they found one another and created a community where they belonged. In this panoramic and exciting prequel to Journey to Zelindar, Diana Rivers portrays a world of strong and sensual women, ready to defend themselves against a hostile world without surrendering their ability to love one another.",
