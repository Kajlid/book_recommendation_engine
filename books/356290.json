  "title": "The Lost Continent",
  "description": "England a legend, Europe a myth, Asia a tale with which to frighten children. That was the world of the 22nd century, where the United States of America was a fortress of civilization barricaded against any contact with the world beyond its bordering seas.  When Jefferson Turck crossed beyond the thirtieth meridian and found himself in the lost continent overseas, what he found bore no resemblance to the legends. For Grabritin was a jungle comparable with Darkest Africa, lions and all, and its queen was a barbaric forest maiden.",
