The prospect of breaking the news to her son seems daunting, but it's nothing compared to the nightmare of meeting Brian's superstrict, off-the-wall, disapproving parents.After Jillian, Brian and his younger brother Jim, learn an eye-opening secret about the Nash parents they all go scurrying back to Miami where Jillian's best friend Victoria finds Brian's sexy, but innocent college senior brother to be just what the doctor ordered. But when Jim comes on a little too seriously, will Victoria lose interest and return to her life of casual fun or will things get even more complicated? Friends With Full Benefits is the second book in the Friends With Benefits series. And although the stories are connected, they can be read on their own and book two is a great introduction to the hilarious and complicated world of Jillian and Victoria.It's an edgy and somewhat raunchy romp filled with humor, sex, romance, passion and surprises. Full Benefits will leave you laughing out loud, slightly worked up and maybe even chasing your spouse or partner around the bedroom...",
