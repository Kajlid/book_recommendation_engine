Somehow he found my awkward, shy self endearing. And something about him filled in the emptiness I’d felt my entire life even while surrounded by my friends and family. My soul recognized him and my body came alive from his heated touches and praises.He spoke of reincarnation and how all the myths were real. He told me I was the reincarnation of someone special. But he couldn’t tell me who without fracturing my mind.After meeting him, strange things started happening. Someone was always watching me, everywhere I went, everything I did.(Naturally,) Rune was the only one I could trust to keep me safe from this mystery threat.While on the run, I was forced to figure out who I was and what I was. Both past and present. And how Rune played into this knowing who I was in my past life.Please check the front part of the book with a note from the author that lists components of the book and series that some are allergic to.
