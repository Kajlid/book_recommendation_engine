  "description": "In the reality show Got Men? six young men are selected, they assume randomly, for their participation as housemates in an isolated location in Nevada. The purpose of their stay is never revealed to them. Conrad Hogan, an unemployed construction worker begins to suspect what the ultimate goal is of the producers; Derek Dixon, Will Markham, and director Charlotte Deavers. When Conrad realizes that he and his five handsome, single housemates are being set up for a huge fall, Conrad panics and has to make decisions based on what the ubiquitous cameras and microphones will reveal. Among Conrad's housemates are Tony Spagna, the tough New York Harley Rider from the Men in Motion Series, Leather Boys, and Alfonso Garofalo, the striking tennis instructor who was involved in an illicit affair with Senator Kipp Kensington's wife, Louise, in Exposure. And as a special treat for my fans; my gift to you is the singer and actor, Chris Salvatore's cover photo. To all his fans and fans to be, please enjoy Chris' beauty as my present to you. www.chris-salvatore.com J o s h W i l l i a m s P h o t o g r a p h y 9 4 1 . 3 0 6 . 8 2 6 3 www.joshwilliamsphotography.com",
