  "description": "Don’t miss out on the exciting conclusion to the Camos and Cupcakes series from USA Today bestselling author Melissa Schroeder.Hey, there. Fritz O’Bryan at your service, the only remaining single guy in the Camos and Cupcakes shop. My friends call me a player, and I try to live up to their expectations. I mean, the women of San Antonio are relying on me to save them from boredom. That is until I find myself practically homeless thanks to my jerk of a cat. The last person I expect to save me is world class chef Savannah Martinez. With the temperament of a Hell’s Kitchen reject, she’s the kind of woman I usually avoid. Still, beggars can’t be choosers, so I take her up on her offer.The thing is it doesn't take long to discover that prickly woman is kind of sweet. She shows me time and again that she does have a softer side, one that I definitely want to get to know. And when her world implodes, I’m more than happy to be the soft place for her to fall.Losing my heart to her was never in my plans. Now that it’s happened, I have to convince her that I not only know how to play the game, but I know how to win her heart.Warning: This book includes more cupcakes (of course), a trip to the altar for Ginger Jesus and his Sunshine, more time with EJ’s Gran, a bachelorette party, drunken reveals, and a turn on the dance floor that leaves the hero…floored. This seduction is slow and easy and…well, let’s not get into that too much. This might be the last of the Camos and Cupcakes guys, but it isn’t the last trip into their world, so don’t cry, just be happy. Oh, did I mention...CUPCAKES?!",
