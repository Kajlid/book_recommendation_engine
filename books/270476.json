  "description": "The Heights of Macchu Picchu is the finest and most famous of Pablo Neruda's longer poems and provides the key to his earlier work. It was inspired by his journey to Macchu Picchu, the beautiful Peruvian Inca city high in the Andes. Neruda's journey takes on all the symbolic qualities of a personal venture into the interior; as the poem progresses, exploring both the inner roots of the poet and the past of Latin American man.",
