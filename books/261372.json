  "description": "Madison is about to get intercepted by a man from her past. Luckily her guys have a good defense.   When I inherited a pro football team in Birmingham, Alabama, they were the worst in the league. And I was an even worse owner.  That was six weeks ago, at the beginning of preseason.  Since then, the team’s won some games, lost a coach (well, okay, I fired the jerk), and tied up a lot of loose ends.  Not all of them, though. I’m still seriously interested in three of the players—and they like me, even if I’m an idiot about football. But they—and their game—are subjects I’m willing to tackle. Three times over, if I can just get the chance.  And then my ex-boyfriend shows up, and he's got some seriously offensive plays. Too bad for him, I've learned a few of my own lately.    Order now and get Second and Five, book two of A Team of Her Own by a New York Times Bestselling duo, for the special preorder price of $2.99.",
