  "description": "Thirty four year old Alexandria Marie Bell appears to have it all. She is beautiful and has started a highly successful law firm in Manhattan. The only thing missing is love. Finding a man is no problem. They are practically falling out of the sky. But she doesnt want just any man. She wants Maxwell Pennington but that can never happen. He loves control almost as much as she does. Plus he is a Senior Partner in her law firm. To top it off Alex has too many ugly dark secrets that must never come to light. If they were to cross that line she runs the risk of Max learning who she really is and he would leave her anyway. Its best to stay single and dream about the life that she will never have. Maxwell Pennington is sexy and brilliant. He could charm the panties off any women with the exception of one. Alex Bell. She wants him. That is not a secret but what he cant figure out is why she is so determined to keep her distance. All he has to do is find a way to break through her walls. His luck with women has not always been the best. Partly due to his control issues and partly due to his choice of women. Alex is different though. She will not just allow him to control her and that is fine with him. Nothing turns him on more than a feisty woman. They would be perfect together. But there is more to Maxwell than meets the eye. He has secrets of his own.",
