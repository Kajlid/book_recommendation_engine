  "description": "My name is Bevin Shaw and I’m desperate to escape my family. I don’t want to be a Shaw anymore—I never did. Not when that “family” sacrifices its youngest to make the eldest more powerful to stay at the top of the magical world.I hid my magic when I was young and for years under their roof, but if they ever learned how powerful I am, they would find a way to drag me back and take it… Not caring for a second it would mean my death. That’s how toxic and evil my family is.Feel better about how bad yours is?Glad I could help.Now that I’m of age and the law requires me to attend college instead of being homeschooled, this is the chance I have suffered for.But nothing is ever that easy, right? People that horrible are never going to play fair and let me go when they see me as an asset they own.I have to put my faith in people I’ve never met and pray to the gods that nothing else distracts me from achieving freedom. After that… There’s no reason I can’t enjoy the view on campus, right?Morrigan University is a spicy reverse harem, university-age paranormal academy series with darker elements, strong language, violence, and a heroine who always does her best no matter what’s thrown at her… While trying to figure out what and who her heart wants.*This book is part of a series and cannot be read as a standalone. Like all my books, this is not light and fluffy and includes dark themes and events some may find triggering. Reader discretion is advised.",
