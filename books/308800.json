  "title": "Delicate Surrender",
  "description": "A forbidden night turns my rather straight-laced life upside down. She is only meant to be a distraction, one seductive scene, but I don’t want to let go. I’m convinced my heart is locked away. I’m sure she can’t break down my walls. But with her delicate surrender, I find myself wanting so much more. Would she let me in? Or will our tryst be nothing more than a forgotten memory?",
