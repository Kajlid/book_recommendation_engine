  "description": "A Manga and a Book of Posthuman. It unfolds how a boy's life turned into what his parents and the Brotherhood fear. Will his predatorial transformation be either a blessing or an affliction?Just a glimpse!Zenie curiously stepped through an open door to another realm. His wild curiosity resulted in insanity of frightening metamorphoses (a Predator) affecting the Black Wolf Brotherhood of alchemy and wisdom's daily routine, thus summoning the greedy Congregation to overthrow Elder Brother's administration and his entire colleagues. Sending Sira, the serpent god, to resume and to comply to the Congregation's order, Zenie must plan a clever way to save not only the human world, but also the predators'. How would a posthuman Zenie save a world of predators? Will he be alone to lead a battle against the army of Sira? Will he be worthy of becoming the next wolf god predator of the vampire wolves?Zenie's vision on dimension universe of the Fourth Realm is bravery but recklessness. With only the gut feeling plus his vision, he wanted to save both the world of humans and the Predators' kingdom from Sira's plot of conquest. The answer is . . . into the gateway of the Fourth Realm, even it would mean his death!As Neil deGrasse Tyson said, \"The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.\"",
