  "title": "Snatch: The Shooting Script",
  "description": "From the writer/director of the dazzling surprise hit Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels that grossed over $100 million and won the Edgar for Best Movie (1999) from the Mystery Writers of America—from Screen Gems (Sony Pictures). A diamond heist gone helter-skelter, the rough and tumble world of bare-knuckle boxing, an unpredictable Irish gypsy and...a dog. Writer-director Guy Ritchie's highly anticipated comedy takes the gangster genre into another dimension—hilarity. The colorful ensemble cast features Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina, Jason Flemyng, Vinnie Jones, Brad Pitt and Jason Statham. Double-crossing, double-bluffing and double-dealing abound as various parties pursue personal agendas—all of them illegal, some of them farcical and most of them involving an 86-carat diamond. As plans go haywire and tempers fray, dogs, diamonds, mobile homes, boxers and assorted weaponry get swept up into a chaotic free-for-all. Who will emerge with the stone? Snatch premiered in England in September 2000 to rave reviews and huge box office! This Newmarket Shooting Script ® edition of the book includes the complete shooting script, an introduction by Ritchie, stills and credits.",
