  "description": "The Druggish were much better at their job than all the king's horses had been with Humpty Dumpty. First, the Druggish simply disassembled Edward Berner--tissue by tissue, nerve by nerve. In tanks they stored the million remnants and shreds that had been Berner, and they changed his brain into a fantastic recording device. Then they simply put him back together. Sinew by sinew, cell by cell. But it was not the same Edi Berner. The new Ed Berner was stronger, healthier--stronger and healthier than any other man. And with a sexual appetite and a promised life-span greater than anyone on earth. He was very nearly invincible. Very nearly. Unfortunately, there was a deadly flaw. The Druggish had forgotten to make the new Ed Berner a wiser one.",
