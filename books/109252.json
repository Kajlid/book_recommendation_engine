  "title": "Starfish: A Mother's Recovery from Addiction",
  "description": "When heroin and opiates became more essential to Donna George than life itself, everything else fell away, even her children. Only when she was busted and forced to choose between jail or a radical rehab called Sunflower House, did one last chance appear. She feared the hardcore program, but the easier, kinder ones hadn't worked. Maybe tough counselors and an assortment of colorful characters could help her find the way through the madness, back to her daughters and her better self. A gritty, inspirational memoir about addiction and recovery.",
