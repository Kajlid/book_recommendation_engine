  "description": "The third instalment of The Scarlet Series Let it go free. If it comes back to you, it’s yours forever. Shy, homebody Sophie Edwards has had enough of being taken advantage of. It’s time she grew a backbone, starting with venturing on a singles holiday, one where she’s free to come out of her shell, to flirt and have fun. Instead, she becomes stranded far from home, trying to figure out how she became the wife of a man with feelings for another woman. A man who she’s in danger of falling in love with herself. Rugby player and rare gentleman Marcus Coetzee knows he’s not being straight with Sophie, but after getting his fingers burnt, he’s fed up of being the ‘nice guy’. It’s time he lived a little and another game of love certainly isn’t in his plans. He just needs Sophie to help keep his friends and family off his back for a while. Sophie and Marcus have their own reasons for not telling the truth, but the trouble with deception is, it becomes difficult to tell when they're deceiving themselves. Far from being the neutral relationship they both envisage, as they spend more time together, outside interests lose their attention and the sparks between them ignite into a firestorm of erotic sensations. Succumbing to the temptation of what they've kindled, they revel in the attraction between them. However, as the end of Sophie’s holiday draws near, do they continue the deception and douse the blaze, or do they come clean and let the flames become eternal?",
