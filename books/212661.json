  "description": "What is the difference between having empathy and being an empath? \"Having empathy means our heart goes out to another person in joy or pain,\" says Dr. Judith Orloff. \"But for empaths it goes much further. We actually feel others' emotions, energy, and physical symptoms in our own bodies, without the usual defenses that most people have.\" The Empath's Survival Guide is an invaluable resource for empaths and anyone who wants to nurture their empathy and develop coping skills in our high-stimulus world—while fully embracing their gifts of intuition, compassion, creativity, and spiritual connection.  This practical, empowering, and loving book was created to support empaths through their unique challenges and help loved ones better understand the empath's needs and gifts. Dr. Orloff offers crucial practices, including:  • Exercises to help you identify your empath type and where you are on the empathy spectrum; • Tools for protecting yourself from sensory overload, exhaustion, addictions, and compassion fatigue while replenishing your vital energy; • Simple, effective strategies to stop absorbing stress and physical symptoms from others and protect yourself from narcissists and other energy vampires; • How to find the right work that feeds you; • How to navigate intimate relationships without feeling overwhelmed; • Guidance for parenting and raising empathic children; • Awakening the empath's gift of intuition and deepening your spiritual connection to all living beings.  For any sensitive person who's been told to \"grow a thick skin,\" here is a lifelong guide for staying fully open while building resilience, exploring your gifts of depth and compassion, and feeling welcome and valued by a world that desperately needs what you have to offer.",
