  "description": "Courtney Ross has lived her whole life doing everything by the book. That's gotten her good grades, the title of captain of her team, and the gift of being a nervous wreck most of the time. She will be spending the summer before her senior year with her best friend, Vanessa, in her tiny hometown of Gem City, Ohio. Courtney’s hoping for a chance to breathe and maybe to get a tan. What she doesn’t expect is Ethan Fisher and his guitar. She must answer the age old question, what does come of eating doughnuts with a boy who plays guitar? In her touching debut novel, Nicole Campbell delivers a perfect summer read. Readers will re-live their first relationships (the good, the bad, and the overwhelming), or imagine the spark of what the future might hold in this story full of the type of intensity only found in young love. *Alternate Cover Edition.
