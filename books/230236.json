  "description": "What would you do if one morning you woke up and found that you were a relic; a 40,000 year old artifact, all that remained of the movers, shakers, and candlestick makers? What would be your reaction to being informed that you are quite literally older than dirt? (And yes you will have to explain what dirt actually is) Would you cry? Or would you do as I did? Get furious and start a big olâ€™ hissy fit sized war.",
