  "description": "Ray Vukcevich's new collection includes 33 previously uncollected stories, all with his trademark whimsical skewed look at the world around us. It's a world seemingly not our own, and yet if we look hard enough we'll find that world just out of sight around the corner. A world of hidden stairs, funny smells, vampire girlfriends, fire women, missle boys, secret libraries, and outlandish (and yet frightenly real) airline procedures. Wonderfully inventive and wildly unpredictable, these stories are sure to entertain and surprise you.",
