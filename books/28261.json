  "description": "In this sexy, twisting thriller, Hil and Zack -- a beautiful woman and a man who knows better -- must escape a stalker whose fate is tied to their own. St John and Wagner play with conventions, leading readers in unexpected directions with a story that deftly weaves two tales of love, sex, greed, and betrayal. St John's distinctive art style perfectly matches the shadowy criminal world of Baja.",
