  "description": "Come on up to Cannery Row- to the wildest party you've ever dreamed of- a party that took weeks to prepare- that wrecked a house- that made history on a street where parties were expected to be sensational! This is the story of the men and women who threw that tremendous shindig- those fun-filled, salty, amazing tramps and wenches who dwell in the shacks and shanties of magnificent Cannery Row. America's great John Steinbeck has packed his novel full of gusto and passion.",
