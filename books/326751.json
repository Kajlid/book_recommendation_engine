  "description": "Port Black - a dark and sinister city abandoned to The Exiled, a gang of unhinged and psychotic demons who have claimed it as their own.And it just so happens to be the location of my first solo mission.As a trained agent of Montague Industries, it’s my job to keep innocents safe. The Exiled are a threat that needs to be neutralized, and I’m ready for battle.With an invitation to their depraved nightclub in hand, a leather corset wrapped around my torso and a mask complete with tall bunny ears, these demons aren’t going to be able to resist me. The only problem? I wasn’t expecting their brand of insanity to be so… exasperatingly delicious.I might look like a snack to these males - who have been apex predators for far too long - but I assure you, I’m nobody’s prey. I’m going to expose the demons of Port Black, and then?Then they will beg for mercy that will never come.Demons in My Bed is the first in a new series from the bestselling author of Emerald Lakes. These characters were introduced in The Magic of Eternity, but it is not necessary to read this before diving into Port Black. This novel contains adult situations, graphic sexual scenes and MM content. Please check trigger warnings.",
