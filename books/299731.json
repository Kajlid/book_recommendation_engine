When sixteen-year-old Sana learns her crush is a shape-shifting beast in hiding, and she’s a descendant of the Coven that can either save or destroy him, she’s forced to make a choice that will determine their future—if she accepts her destiny. With the coven on their trail, Sana and Kiaan escape to the Underworld where they must destroy the Blederz and save the surviving Dark Beings from the coven’s reign of terror. But when the roses in Silver Moon valley start dying out, Kiaan's beast may just not survive.",
