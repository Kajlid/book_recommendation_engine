  "description": "Release Date: 3/16/15  Violet was fascinated with the legends and lore of New Orleans. She was so fascinated that she left everything behind to run a B&B in the French Quarter. But she never imagined that vampires were really real... not until the night she found herself swept back in time to 1797. Beaten and scared, Violet quickly realizes she's trapped... and in the most exotic bordello of all. But its clients aren't mortal, at least not anymore. Locked in an era that's not her own, she must find a way to escape from the powerful lure of vampire seductiveness... before it's too late.",
