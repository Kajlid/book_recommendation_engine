  "description": "Alarms screamed as hard radiation sleeted through the surviving Hellcats. Consoles blanked as external aerials burnt off the superheated alloy skins.An impossibly long prominence exploded from the Sun’s north pole. Then the globe itself elongated as if the star was straining out after the fleeing ships to engulf them in anuclear maw.James Corley’s SUNDRINKER mixes roaring adventure with bizzare satire as Earth Defence Forces fail to save human space from invasion by the malevolent Thight. In the face of calamity all the squabbles between Earth, its colonies and the eccentric terrorists of Spade must be forgotten.And Jonah Scull finds himself snatched from the court where he is charged with genocide and is told to save humanity.By the same authorBenedict’s Planet",
