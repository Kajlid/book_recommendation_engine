  "title": "Howards End",
  "description": "'Only connect' is the idea at the heart of this book, a heartbreaking and provocative tale of three families at the beginning of the twentieth century: the rich Wilcoxes, the gentle, idealistic Schlegels, and the lower-middle-class Basts. As the Schlegel sisters try desperately to help the Basts and educate the close-minded Wilcoxes, the families are drawn together in love, lies and death.Frequently cited as E. M. Forster's finest work, Howards End brilliantly explores class warfare, conflict and the English character.",
