  "description": "For Hollywood stunt girl Juniper Warren, the dangers of running a motor bike off a sheer cliff are nothing compared to the sheer terror of being forced out of a vintage airplane without a parachute. Juniper has to use the witching powers bequeathed by her grandmother if she is to survive. And once she does, she will find herself face to face with her evil black widow spider Aunt Regina who will do anything to destroy her.",
