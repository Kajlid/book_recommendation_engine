  "description": "The texts came six months late. Or maybe just in time.Inspired by a true story.No one's falling asleep during this fast-paced mix of romantic comedy and adventure-drama inspired by a true event - when 170,000 texts were sent to American's cell phones six months late.When wedding event planner Charlie (Allie McCarney's sister from the first novel The Ticket) and her friends Justine and Sharon get text messages on Valentine's day sent six months earlier, their love lives take huge nose dives, and they turn to each other for moral support and to celebrate Justine's 40th. But it's not any ordinary 40th birthday party. Charlie's surprise text is from her first love, famed rocker Dayton Hill, and it incites Charlie to cancel her engagement and meet him again. He comes to Charlie's rescue when the wedding singer cancels at the fancy hotel wedding she's planned. Throw Charlie's hilarious, eccentric Wiccan roommate - who also got a confusing text and is out for revenge - into the mix as a wedding-crasher, and nothing's about to happen as Charlie planned it. And Charlie is used to doing things a certain way. But Charlie soon learns that old habits can be changed, even shaken up a little for the better, and love that's meant for you always returns.This is a screenplay for a film or TV series, but it can be read like a light novel. It's the fifth standalone story in the LOVE AGAIN series of Second Chance Romances. You can read them in any order!PG-13 This screenplay contains mature language and descriptive sex.",
