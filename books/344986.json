  "title": "Tell Me Another Morning: An Autobiographical Novel",
  "description": "This autobiographical novel depicts a teenage girl’s experience in the Nazi concentration camps. As in The Diary of Anne Frank, Tania’s youthful concerns are interwoven among accounts of extremity: her brother’s murder, her mother’s choice to stay with her father and die in the gas chamber rather than be transported to another camp, the saving friendships Tania develops, her relationships with young men and the guards. Throughout the novel we see claustrophobic uncertainty, grief, terror, exhaustion, and Tania’s sustaining hope. Her return to Prague after the war is unforgettable and devastating, as she observes people wearing “normal” clothes, eating ice cream, and traveling on buses between work and home. There is no judgment, only the reality of two worlds existing simultaneously. With spare prose, Zdena Berger’s first-hand observations convey the deprivation and brutality in which Tania comes of age, and the friendships and hope that help her to survive.",
