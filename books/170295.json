Jake Wilson is a very successful tattoo artist in California. He lives his life on the go and there's not a shortage of women at his disposal at any point in time. His life is perfect for a man who has no desire to commit and the stories he could tell you would either terrify you or have you intrigued and hoping to become his next treat.

Her partnership with Jax Wilson brings her face to face with Jax's twin brother Jake. His sexy charm won't work on her because she sees right through his intentions. What happens when Jake is determined to break through her sophisticated demeanor and show her his true personality? Will she fall for his wild existence or will she be the one to leave him always wanting more?",
