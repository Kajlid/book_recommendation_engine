  "title": "The Myth of the Holy Cow",
  "description": "Hugely controversial upon its publication in India, this book has already been banned by the Hyderabad Civil Court and the authorâ€™s life has been threatened. Jha argues against the historical sanctity of the cow in India, in an illuminating response to the prevailing attitudes about beef that have been fiercely supported by the current Hindu right-wing government and the fundamentalist groups backing it.",
