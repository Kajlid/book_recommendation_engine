  "description": "It wasn't that A. J. didn't like Mr. Tubbs. It was just that Mr. Tubbs was so old—nearly 100! And old people made A. J. nervous. They didn't seem to do anything but sit around and discuss their grandchildren, and talk about how good things used to be.So A. J. couldn't really explain what he was doing in a battered old VW with Mr. Tubbs, a crazy girl named Eloise, and a basset hound named Gwendolyn. Why was he going on this wild goose chase to find a ranch north of Tucson which Mr. Tubbs hadn't seen in fifteen years?It all began one Saturday when A. J. went to visit his grandfather in a nursing home in Tucson. Sharing the room with his grandfather was an old ex-cowboy, Mr. Tubbs, who was full of stories about life on the range and of the ranch up north where he used to work.A. J. met Eloise (also known as Spence) in the home, too. Spence went there not because she had a relative to see—but because she actually liked to visit the old people! It was Spence's idea that she and A. J. smuggle Mr. Tubbs out of the home and drive him north to Flagstaff for one last look at the ranch he loved so much.So there they were... with the car about to break down and nothing to guide them but Mr. Tubb's 1920s road map. And probably facing a charge of kidnapping too, thought A. J.What happens when they finally reach Flagstaff, and what A. J. learns about himself—and about Mr. Tubbs—makes a funny and moving story.",
