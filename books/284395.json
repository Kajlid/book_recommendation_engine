  "description": "Deep in the Chippewa National Forest on the shores of what the French called Lac Sangsue lies the Leech Lake Indian Reservation. The reservation predates the state of Minnesota and is home to a people with rich traditions and cultural heritage. It’s also home to a dark secret. A secret that a con artist, a fading celebrity attorney and the number one contender for the middleweight title all have a stake in. When a federal inmate’s claim of innocence makes its way into the hands of a non-profit run by the attorney it will set them all on a collision course with life altering ramifications.",
