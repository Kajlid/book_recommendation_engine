  "description": "Leigh Bardugo meets The Sixth Sense in this story of one girl's perilous journey to restore a lost order.    Imagine you live with your aunt, who hates you so much she's going to sell you into a dreadful apprenticeship. Imagine you run away before that can happen. Imagine that you can see ghosts—and talk with the dead. People like you are feared, even shunned.  Now imagine . . . the first people you encounter after your escape are a mysterious stranger and a ghost boy, who seem to need you desperately—though you don't understand who they are or exactly what they want you to do. So you set off on a treacherous journey, with only a ghost dog for company. And you find that what lies before you is a task so monumental that it could change the world.  Praise for Rachel Neumeier's The Keeper of the Mist:\"This is a beautifully written story that emphasizes intelligence and diplomacy. Recommend to fans of Patricia Wrede...",
