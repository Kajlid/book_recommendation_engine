  "description": "Money isn't everything . . .Pine Hollow Stables has a new resident, and while The Saddle Club loves all horses, they aren't impressed by this one. Honey-Pie is a sweet old mare, but there's nothing special about her--or is there? It turns out that Honey-Pie is a million-dollar horse! She inherited her million from her owner, Emma Fredericks. Mrs. Fredericks also left a million dollars to her nephew, Paul, but his money is all gone. Now Paul wants Honey-Pie's inheritance, and he'll do anything to get it. It's up to The Saddle Club to save Honey-Pie and unmask Paul as the horse-hating rat that he is.",
