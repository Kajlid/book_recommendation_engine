After recovering from culture shock, Ali makes friends with an international band of nannies, falls in love with the produce boy at the grocery store, and travels to France on a dream vacation turned nightmare, where she cheats on the only boyfriend she's ever had with a rich college boy from England. In order to impress her rich college boy, Ali steals from her employers, lies to her friends, and gets caught breaking and entering while wearing a $7000 dress, only to discover that it was all for naught. Disillusioned and distraught, Ali must redeem herself before her summer in Belgium is over.",
