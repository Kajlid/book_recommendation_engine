  "title": "The Darker Side of Trey Grey",
  "description": "No one told Trey Grey that life could be dark and unpredictable. With the death of his father when he was eight, his mother’s departure from Earth on a syringe full of heroin, and the brutal abuse of his stepfather, Trey learned these lessons all too well on his own.Now at twenty years of age, he is nearing the completion of his accounting degree and can finally glimpse the end of his life as a prostitute. The only profession he has ever known. Wracked by nightmares of Willie’s years of abuse, and controlled by severe obsessive-compulsive disorders as a result, he seems to have a tentative handle on his own life. That is, as long as he keeps a death-grip and no one touches his Camaro, kitten.But even the best laid plans can be torn to gory bits.His savior comes in the unlikely form of a spiky-haired blond named Justin, after a night of drunken debauchery that neither of them seems able to forget. Justin might just need Trey as much as Trey needs him. Trey travels through his fearscapes and begins to find his own forgiveness, but at what cost to the manic-depressive Justin? Will they be able to live through the trauma of each other’s lives and find their own version of normal? This is a gritty and raw story about escapism, and how one’s life can alter course when you least expect it. Trey looks at his own life with an irony that is sometimes amusing and often shocking, yet quickly draws the reader to his corner.",
