  "description": "Out of printSunny O’Hara hopes to call the tiny slice of France her new home. Her parents met and fell in love on the Caribbean island, but she and her dad left after her mother’s death. Sunny is back on St. Barts hoping to build rental villas on some family land and finally have a social life after nursing her father until his death. Sunny hasn’t dated and sometimes feels as though she’s wearing a scarlet “V” on her chest. Enter Sven Larsen, a Hollywood bad boy, a movie star in the making. He’s on St. Barts for what could be a career-changing role. He’s also antsy. His steady diet of booze and eager bed partners has left him feeling empty. He wants something more, something real. He’s intrigued by the strange woman he meets cooking after hours at a local restaurant. When she turns up on set as a translator, he gives in to temptation and asks her out. Sunny turns the table at dinner and propositions her date. Will he be her sexual mentor? Sven is shocked, intrigued, and ultimately enthusiastic. The lessons proceed in scorching secrecy, but word leaks out, and soon the tabloids are hunting for Sven’s latest lover. Not everyone is pleased about the liaison. Sunny’s friend, Mimi, worries that she’s in over her head. Sven’s friend, Clyde, worries the actor is getting too attached. As lust flares into love, someone decides to take drastic action and the romance between the virgin and the movie star takes a tragic turn. St. Barts is a novel about the allure of celebrity and fame, about the enduring need for roots, and ultimately, about love. It’s also a love letter to a beautiful island.",
