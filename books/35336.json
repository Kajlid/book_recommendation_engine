  "description": "A strangely admirable killer leaves a courteous note. A welcoming bachelor wonders, \"Do ants like Harry Belafonte?\" A lonely passenger on a dangerous flight ponders his rebellion via the airsick bag. And a hopeful young man trades his afternoon for the promise of sex he knows he won't end up having anyway. Welcome to the deceptively simple worlds that can only come from the mind of Scott Morgan. Funny, sweet, sad, and bitter, this collection of eight poems and ten short stories offers a snapshot of humanity that is as off-center as it is familiar.",
