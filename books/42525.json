  "description": "An award-wining biologist takes us on the dramaticexpeditions that unearthed the history of life onour planet.Just 150 years ago,most of our world was an unexploredwilderness.Our sense of how old it was? Vague andvastly off the mark. And our sense of our own species'history? A set of fantastic myths and fairy tales. Fossils hadbeen known for millennia, but they were seen as the bonesof dragons and other imagined creatures.In the tradition of The Microbe Hunters and Gods,Graves, and Scholars, Sean Carroll's Remarkable Creaturescelebrates the pioneers who replaced our fancies with theeven more amazing true story of how our world evolved.Carroll recounts the most important discoveries in twocenturies of national history â€” from Darwin's trip aroundthe world to CharlesWalcott's discovery of pre-Cambrianlife in the Grand Canyon; from Louis and Mary Leakey'sinvestigation of our deepest past in East Africa to thetrailblazers in modern laboratories who have located a timeclock in our DNA. Join him in a rousing voyage of discovery,from the epic journeys of pioneering naturalists to the breakthroughsmaking headlines today.",
