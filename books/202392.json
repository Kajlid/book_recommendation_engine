  "description": "Dreams tell old man Paul T’Sosi he’s dying. So why is Navajo trickster, Magpie, trying to tell him a far more terrifying secret? Hungry for revenge, Ma’iitsoh Dine’, the Navajo Wolf, is out for blood. Summoning his darkest powers, the Witch of Ganado circles tribal investigator Charlie Yazzie’s young son. Some may survive the witch’s evil vendetta, but others will die to settle an old score. The unexpected happens when a woman from the past re-emerges to take control in this fast paced thriller critics now hail as the best yet of Chappell’s sensational new southwestern mystery series. Critics describe R. Allen Chappell’s writing as “embedded and close to the ground” with an intuitive knowledge of the Navajo people and their land. Magpie Speaks, number 5 in the series, cements Chappell's legacy and puts him in the forefront of modern day Navajo Mystery storytellers.",
