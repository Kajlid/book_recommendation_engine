  "description": "Taking over this family isn’t going to be easy. There are a lot of things that have been left undealt with. A lot of people need reminding of the man I am; what I can do to them, what I can have done to them. I control the cards. I determine what happens. The outcome is in my hands. I am the king.Weakness isn’t a possibility. I’m not weak. I don’t cry or tell a sob story. Why would I? I wanted to be like my father; strong, willful, powerful. I wanted to make him proud. Jax will keep me as his bride and I will fight back. My words will be silent, my actions controlled. And when he least expects it-when I least expect it- I will do the unthinkable, unimaginable, in my world.",
