From his exploration of the social and economic conditions, the state, religion and the fine arts, a vibrant picture emerges of a massive and fertile exchange that would influence the destiny of more than a billion people. This volume, along with A. L. Basham’s classic The Wonder That Was India (Volume One), offers an extensive and engrossing view of the pre-colonial history of India.",
