  "description": "Dino Triziano is the foreman in charge of building the new home for Zeus's pack. When he discovers there are more than humans inhabiting the planet, he runs in panic. Sidney Porter is a shifter from another pack. He's addicted to Red Bull and Bingo, and he is upset when he thinks his mate, Torem, is cheating on him with the foreman of the construction crewâ€”until he gets a whiff of Dino. Torem takes a journey to cleanse the betrayal and pain Jackson has left behind while trying to keep his mate safe from the wolves coming after him from Sidney's pack. Can Torem, Beta of the pack, keep his mates safe while fighting for his sanity? Will Dino come to terms with the fact that there are shifters in the world, and can Sidney find his bingo hall while trying to kick the sugar drink?  Each book in Lynn Hagen's Zeus's Pack collection features a different romantic trio. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
