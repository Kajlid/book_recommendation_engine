  "title": "Square Foot Gardening: A New Way to Garden in Less Space with Less Work",
  "description": "One of the bestselling garden books ever is fresher than ever! Ready to inspire a whole new generation of gardeners.When he created the \"square foot gardening\" method, Mel Bartholomew, a retired engineer and efficiency expert, found the solution to the frustrations of most gardeners. His revolutionary system is simple: it's an ingenious planting method based on using square foot blocks of garden space instead of rows. Gardeners build up, not down, so there's no digging and no tilling after the first year. And the method requires less thinning, less weeding, and less watering.\"I found a better way to garden, one that's more efficient, more manageable, and requires less work,\" Bartholomew explains. Not surprisingly, his method quickly received worldwide recognition and has been written up in every major newspaper and gardening magazine. His book, which served as the companion to the nationally acclaimed television series, has sold over 800,000 copies. Now freshened with new illustrations, the book Ingram calls \"the largest selling garden book in America\" is reissued for the delight of a whole new generation of gardeners.",
