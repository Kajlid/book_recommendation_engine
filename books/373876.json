  "title": "314 Crescent Manor",
  "description": "Mark and Nathan Connor are estranged twins. There is little to connect them, save their current residence at 314 Crescent Manor, an old building situated in the centre of the city. The tenants of the Manor are never housed at random. With its large, brooding stained glass tree bearing down on them from the fifth floor to the first, it watches, and waits for one world to topple into the next.NOTE: This novel was originally presented in a web series format, with the arc of the story following what would happen in a televised show such as a mini-series or soap opera. There are considerable experimental ('weird') themes within, and it does have strong GLBT leanings, so if this is not your cuppa, you can't say you didn't see the stop sign.",
