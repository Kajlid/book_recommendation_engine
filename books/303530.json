  "description": "Cultural Studies. Literature and Essays. Contemporary alchemist Dale Pendell completes his three-volume poetic study of botany, chemistry, spirituality, psychology and history with a book covering the composition and uses of visionary plants. Pharmacognosis is the branch of pharmacology that deals with herbs and unprepared medicines in their natural state, those whose cure is held in a deeper wisdom. PHARMAKO/GNOSIS weaves together writing on ancient shamanic rites, historical cultural lore and the contemporary use of plant poisons. In chapters \"Phantastica,\" \"Hypnotica,\" and \"Telephorica,\" Pendell explores hallucinogenic plants, the bringers of sleep, and the bearers of distance. See also PHARMAKO/POEIA and PHARMAKO/DYNAMIS, both available from SPD.",
