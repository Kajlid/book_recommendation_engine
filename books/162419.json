  "title": "A Reunion of Ghosts",
  "description": "A compulsively readable literary masterpiece — the shared confessional of three sisters preparing to kill themselves, honouring the dark legacy that has haunted their family. In the waning days of 1999, the Alter sisters gather in their ancestral Upper West Side apartment. An epic family story – inspired partly by the life of Fritz Haber, Nobel Prize winner and inventor of chlorine gas – unfolds. This is a memoir of sisters unified by a singular burden, and an unflinching eulogy to those who have gone before.",
