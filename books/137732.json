  "description": "Best friends since grade school, lovers since high school, Sean Delahunt and Rusty Duchene thought nothing could ever tear them apart. Then Sean graduates college and his world changes, while Rusty’s stays the same. Offered a job in Boston, Sean knows asking Rusty to leave New Orleans is a big sacrifice for his soul mate, who has a successful career and supportive family. Abused and rejected by his own family, Sean struggles with self worth and thinks this career opportunity will give him a new life. Rusty wavers in his trust but takes and chance and agrees to follow him to Boston. Alone for several weeks in a strange city, Sean is determined to make friends on his own. When Rusty arrives, this new Sean makes him feel insecure. Crushing student loans, being unable to find a job and suspicions about the nature of Sean’s friends strain an already tenuous relationship. A trip home for the holidays reminds both men of all they’ve left behind and makes them reevaluate what they want in their future. On the verge of wedding vows, a career crisis threatens to bring their lives back full circle. Money, moves and men…will this longtime love last forever or will life in the big city destroy their young love? This collection includes Meant To Be, Moving On, Tricked Up for Treats, Jingle My Bells and For Better Or",
