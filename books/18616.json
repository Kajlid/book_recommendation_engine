  "description": "Courtney Phillips has always been the standby girl for Christopher Wilkinson, who thinks he's God's gift to women. He isn't. He's a tosser. Just think of one of those guys who sows his wild oats all over the damn shop, then comes home and marries a “good girl.” Courtney's supposed to be the “good girl.”Imagining Chris has gone to South Africa to teach English to underprivileged kids to do something good for the world, Courtney is shocked to get an email from one of the teachers, Ryan Klark, who is sharing living quarters with Chris. They start a relationship via email which grows into something unexpected and romantic, then rather dirty. The story follows their emails, telephone conversations, their first meeting and how they fall in love. But things get complicated when Chris gets back, and the few details Ryan kept out of conversations are revealed—and threaten to ruin everything.",
