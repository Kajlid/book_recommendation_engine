  "description": "Who says you can’t fall in love at seven years old?  I know I did.  The love I felt for my babysitter, Camryn Davison at such a young age transformed over time.  By the time I was a teen that love turned into fantasies I knew would never come true.  By the time I saw her again at twenty-one I was determined to make those fantasies a reality.  If only she’d see me as the man I am now and not the little boy she used to soothe when I had nightmares as a child.  She’s the only one that has an issue with our seven-year age difference, but I’m determined to prove to her that a younger man is exactly what she needs.",
