  "title": "Taylor Takes Charge: A Portland Court Adventure",
  "description": "Ben Glossop, an eighteen year old between school and university, and Sarah Wilton, a beautiful young girl of the same age, have no idea what they are letting themselves in for when they arrive at Portland Court Preparatory School for Boys to be teacher and Under-Matron. But it doesn't take them long to realise that the most important person at this unusual academy is not the headmaster, nor any other adult, but a delightfully engaging twelve year old boy called Taylor. Taylor can see the school would be bound to collapse if the negligent, and frequently inebriated, headmaster and senior staff were to be left in charge, so he quietly takes over. But little does he know how many strange and dangerous adventures will come his way, especially when, much to his initial horror, a girl - Samantha Watson - turns up as a pupil at the school, on the run from a band of kidnappers. Will Taylor triumph? Will Samantha survive?",
