  "description": "\"Other people make a success of riding clubs and I don't see why we shouldn't. It's about the only thing we haven't tried in Chatton.\"Ann Derry, Jill's greatest friend, has a bright idea. They need something to do in the summer, so why not start a riding club? Or, to be more accurate, why doesn't Jill start a riding club? Jill is not keen to start with but with typical Jill verve, start a riding club is exactly what she does. Not everything goes to it's much harder work corralling a load of riders you don't know than Jill thought, and her ghastly cousin Cecilia turning up doesn't help either.",
