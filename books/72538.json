  "description": "You’re a boy who likes pink? Great! You like to play with dolls? Fantastic! Your best friend is a girl—and she likes to crash cars, build things, and play pirates? Awesome! Toys are for having fun, exploring and learning about the bigger world! Forget about what's pink and blue and what toys are for who! How else would a boy decide he wants to be a chef one day? How else might a girl get the idea that she too could be a fire fighter? We are all different and like different things. What matters is that we are happy and confident. Funny and reassuring, Pink is Just a Color and so is Blue teaches children...and adults...about acceptance, tolerance, and having confidence in who you are. The world defined by pink and blue is becoming out-dated, and Bhatia’s humorous story teaches young readers that they should be free to choose what they like without someone dictating what it should be. Pink is Just a Color and So Is Blue will have you laughing, and reminding you of the joy of life’s possibilities, while it teaching your children about the importance of being themselves. To further enrich their reading experience, the author includes discussion questions and activities for parents and teachers.Show More Show Less",
