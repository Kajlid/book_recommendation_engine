  "description": "Building on LoveAs a rancher's daughter, Emily Hubrecht knows a person's land means family and roots. And being half–Native American, the museum curator also has reasons for preserving the historic sites in Apache Creek, Arizona. So when luxury home builder Donovan Russell begins work at a special location, Emily tries to stop him. The handsome architect bulldozes by her on every occasion, his past keeping him from understanding why the land means so much to her. But when he starts working for Emily's father and she unexpectedly falls for Donovan, she plans to show him the importance of tradition—and that together they can build a happily-ever-after.",
