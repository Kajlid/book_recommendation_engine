  "description": "The poetry of the award-winning David McCord is a gift to children and to all who love language. From the brilliantly simple demonstrative of onomatopoeia, The Pickety Fence, to the observant title poem, this is a collection to be cherished. Superbly illustrated by Mark Simont's drawings, which capture the fun and nuance of the words, this group of poems is sure to grab the attention of children, who delight in the magic of wordplay and rhythm -- a magic that David McCord excels at conjuring.",
