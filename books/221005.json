  "description": "What’s at stake when a woman from Michigan—who’s always stood out at six feet tall—tries to fit in on a remote island in Japan? Stacy Gleiss’s captivating memoir answers just that. After a childhood defined by a horrific car accident, Gleiss spends years trying to regain a sense of identity; eventually making her way across the globe where she falls in love with the enchanting culture of Japan. But as Gleiss becomes increasingly immersed in the Japanese way of life—first as a teenage bride and then as a mother—she discovers this faraway land isn’t as perfect as she first imagined. The Six-Foot Bonsai goes behind closed doors in a traditional Japanese family during the 1980s and ’90s, uncovering harsh truths. Gleiss must learn how to transform herself into the ideal Japanese housewife in a culture that holds females to particularly high standards. At the same time, a shocking revelation about her husband tests everything Gleiss once thought she believed in. A detailed look at the Japanese traditions of marriage, womanhood, and child exploitation, The Six-Foot Bonsai is an intimate account of what it’s like to discover a new place while also discovering yourself. “Only someone like Stacy Gleiss, once immersed in a mysterious, all-encompassing, and nearly-cultic culture, could write a book with the authenticity and heart of The Six-Foot Bonsai. Her vulnerability to the aching losses of everything she loved, described dispassionately and with great detail, paves the way for a surprising redemption in the end.”Dr. Latayne C. Scott, author of books on cults, including The Mormon Mirage",
