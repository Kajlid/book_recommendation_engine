  "title": "Happier Than God: Turn Ordinary Life into an Extraordinary Experience",
  "description": "Since the publication of his stunning worldwide bestseller Conversations with God (more than two-and-a-half years on the New York Times list; now published in 37 languages), Walsch has been telling readers that a new understanding of God can change lives and change the world. Now, in this new book, he expands on that theme by exploring how ordinary people can work in direct collaboration with God to transform their everyday lives into extraordinary experiences. This is not a book of spiritual theory. It provides a plan that can change lives. Included here is a program that Walsch calls \"17 Steps to Being Happier than God,\" a plan that combines the best of the conceptual truths of his 9-book Conversations with God series, with the clearest description yet of how to turn those concepts into practical tools for altering life for the betterâ€”forever.",
