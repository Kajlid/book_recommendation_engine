  "description": "Claire is more confused and uneasy about the apparent interest of her new neighbor, Sarik, than flattered. He may be the epitome of every female's desires from eight to eighty, but she knows damned well the same couldn't be said for her in relation to men. As suspicious as she is that his motives have nothing to do with a real attraction to her, though, she discovers she's completely unable to resist his allure.",
