  "description": "EVERY STORM RUNS OUT OF RAIN, AND EVERY DARK NIGHT TURNS INTO DAY  Jett is beautiful, talented, and one of the biggest rock stars in the world. But fame isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Relentless touring, a grueling schedule, and fanatics that want much more from her than an autograph, have left her jaded and tired. When a madman gets too close and threatens her very existence, she calls on the only person she’s ever trusted - Colton James.  Once a dear friend that was ripped out of her life, he’s now the vice president of The Loyal Bastards Motorcycle Club. Colt shows up dripping in tattoos, wrapped in leather and oozing smoldering masculinity, ready to protect the woman that still haunts his dreams. But Jett’s uninhibited wild side and roller coaster curves make it impossible for Colt to stay professional. Sparks fly, and Colt is tempted until he can no longer resist. When he finally gives in, the mistake costs him more than he ever imagined it would.  In the midst of violent danger, Colt and Jett are forced to take the most treacherous ride of their life. Will the strength of the MC brotherhood be enough to help them find their way out of the storm? Or will a crazed fan’s unpredictable insanity rip them out of each others arms once again?",
