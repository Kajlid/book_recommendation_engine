All you need to do is learn to embrace it.Through her thirty years of clinical practice, esteemed psychologist Sandra Parker has seen how what troubles us arises from everything we do to avoid experiencing the vulnerability of our inner lives. Anxiety, intimacy problems, and depression all stem from the conscious and unconscious ways we bypass our experiences.Do you feel free to follow your dreams or are you hampered by self-doubt? Can you stay present in the moment, or are you tormented by worry or regret or a frantic need to keep busy? Do you feel hopeless or self-attacking when faced with your human vulnerability? Does it seem you ought to feel more joy than you do? Can you let in the love of others? Can you connect with the larger world and feel engaged and empowered to make a difference? Are you living the meaningful life you long for? Or have you settled for getting by?In Embracing Unrest, Parker shows you how the answers to your questions are inside you, heralded by a tiny signal that holds the key to your growth. By getting to know the call of unrest, you harness a power that helps you alleviate anxiety and panic, numbness and depression, as you come alive to the promise of your own potential to live more fully.Drawing on brain science and using proven techniques derived from her extensive experience helping others, here Parker teaches you how to slow down enough to recognize the moment when you need to pay attention to your bodyâ€™s signals, to accept your emotions, and the utterly transformational power of mattering deeply to yourself.",
