  "title": "The Revenge of Hothead Paisan: Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist",
  "description": "This book is bound to leave you speechless--either due to slack-jawed shock or belly-aching laughter. It is, as the title does suggest, about a homicidal lesbian terrorist, and all that you might imagine this entails: men-hating, men-bashing, men-dismemberment. Those who are uncomfortable with over-the-top stereotypes should steer way clear of this book. But for the open-minded reader (not limited to militant lesbians), this is one heck of a ride.",
