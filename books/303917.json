So much excitement on turning each page kept me wanting more. My best read in 2020! ‘HOT!’ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ The author Nadine Hall is very good at grinding this stuff out. I must say, she kept the heat up in my loins from beginning to end. Indeed, if she is half as steamy in real life as the stuff she writes - hey, send me your number, I'll buy you a drink. Maybe a purple rain? (read the book to understand.)Let Me Guard Your Heart is the much-anticipated sequel to Guarding My Heart.",
