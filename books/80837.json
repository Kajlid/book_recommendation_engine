  "description": "She's on the run for her life ...As a child, she-wolf healer Reika Snow was promised as a mate to three were-lynxes to prevent a war between her pack and the lynx clan. Her freedom is coming to an end as her twenty-third birthday arrives. With her bleak future as the subjugated bride of the three males looms near, she does the only thing she can think of ... she runs. With the lynxes hot on her tail, the only thing she can do is pray she can find safety, somewhere.He's not going to let her get far ...Bo Elliot, highly ranked member of the Tressel wolf pack, rescues a she-wolf from the claws of three were-lynxes as they attempt to capture her. When she awakens, he's surprised to find himself staring into the beautiful blue eyes of his truemate. With his bum leg, Bo doesn't want to tie Reika down to a wounded male like himself by acknowledging that they're mates, but he vows to set her free from the lynxes and give her back her life. It will take every trick in Bo's book to keep Reika from taking off on her own in a misguided attempt to spare him from getting tangled up in the hot mess of her life, but Bo will do anything for his truemate, even if it means walking away once she's free.This book contains a scarred wolf with a heart of gold, a she-wolf healer who wants to protect her truemate at any cost, and a wolf-on-lynx battle that will determine where Reika spends the rest of her life. Readers should expect possessive werewolves, passionate sex, neck biting, and the kind of horniness that only the full moon can bring.Approximate word count = 47,610.",
