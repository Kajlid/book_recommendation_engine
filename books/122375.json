  "title": "The Fat of The Land",
  "description": "Everyone has a story ...but not every story has a hero.This collection from New Mexico and the Southwest is about those who give life to that land – the outliers, and those who have no one to tell their tale. While some of these narratives are loosely based in fact, they are written with a large dollop of literary license. The characters are not “politically correct” in today’s parlance and speak in the vernacular of their time and culture. Some of them you will like ...others you may not. No disrespect or offense is intended in the telling. These are their stories.",
