And who is the elusive Martin who appears to link them?Martin takes us back to the secret games of their childhood friendship to discover why Reith employs the Dark Web to drive Nocton to desperation. It is the story of a love that has lasted a lifetime and of a desire for revenge that poisons three lives.Reith narrates his own history in a voice which is brilliantly clever, deeply sardonic, and often very funny.  Ian Thomson’s disquieting first novel radically challenges how we think about love, sexuality, friendship and innocence.Ian Thomson was educated at Downing College, Cambridge and lives in Lincoln.",
