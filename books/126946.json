  "description": "Reeling from the events of The Oasis, the doctor retreats to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, living a hermitâ€™s life. But in time he begins to rediscover his humanity, through the companionship of Addy, a faithful dog, and Alain, a mysterious refugee from another walled city. When tragic events again consume his life and threaten his closest friends, will he give in to despair or find a new reason to carry on?  Self Publishing Reviews: \"While a book about outcasts banding together may seem as overdone a trope as zombie fiction itself, once again I have to assure anyone reading this that the author, Keith Soares, is in all ways a step above those expectations in his ideas and his execution... I don't recommend reading this book; I recommend reading every book this author publishes, as I have no doubt he will continue raising the bar.\"",
