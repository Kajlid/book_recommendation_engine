  "description": "Nero is a madman and a murderer…and now Hope belongs to him.Hope's life as an enslaved priestess in the Temple of Hera is all she has ever known. Born to slavery and the golden chain she wears around her neck, very little ever came as a surprise. But when she meets Nero, the only thing she can trust is that everything is about to change. Bought by a man who is unpredictable at best and a madman at worst, she has to be careful not to get burned.Having been spurned by the woman he thought he loved, Nero Finch, Cardinal of the South Wind Dominion, believed he had lost all hope. Rejected, he decides to do the one thing he never does—pray. But the gods are fickle, and the priestess at the temple is frustratingly immune to his usual charms.Now, they can only pray that love really is blind.",
