  "description": "Matt doesn't like to work Halloween cases because of something terrible that's happened on a past case. But, when a client calls and requests them to investigate a property that's at the middle of a will dispute, Zack takes the case anyway because the money is just too good to pass up. Not wanting to let fear rule his decisions, Matt goes along, but what he finds there just might be too much for him to handle and soon getting proof on film isn't as important as getting out alive.",
