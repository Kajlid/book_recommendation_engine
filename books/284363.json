  "description": "Fiestas and Siestas Miles Apart, is a humorous look at what happens to the Cuthbertson family, Alan and Heather along with daughters, Stacey and Ashlie, when they decide to sell everything, (including the family stationery business) load the family car and move from England to Spain. Unfortunately the girls half way through the process have other ideas and take off on their own adventure across Thailand, Australia and New Zealand. The naivety of the, un-street wise pair, is shown in the e-mails and texts received by their parents, who themselves, are fi nding Spanish life a very steep learning curve.",
