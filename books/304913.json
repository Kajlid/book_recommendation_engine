  "description": "RangerNothing about my life has ever been easy, so it makes total sense the moment I found her would be no different. As soon as I laid my eyes on her, I knew how I'd have the biggest fight on my hands. Little did I know there's more to her then I first realized. People say she's emotionless, a void, a shell of the person she used to be. However, I don't agree. I see the raging fire inside of her, desperate to break free.I wonder what my little fury would do if it all came blazing out, but before we realize it, the past comes to present. It threatens those around us in ways we've never dealt with before. Can I protect her when everything comes crashing down, or will she become the harpy she is? I suppose it doesn't matter. Regardless, she's mine-- whether she wants to be or not.",
