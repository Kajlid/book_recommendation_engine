More of me, more of the darkness that I’ve been concealing from her. It’s like she wants all of me, not just the parts I’ve let her see.When danger comes knocking at our door, I can’t hide my true self any longer. But when she sees what I’m capable of, will she still run into my open arms?MINK's Get your kitty and your cocoa for this sweet tale of unconditional love.",
