  "title": "Starbird Murphy and the World Outside",
  "description": "In her sixteen years of life, Starbird has never touched a dollar bill. She’s never been in a car. She’s never used a cell phone.   That’s because Starbird has always lived on the Free Family Farm, a commune in the woods of Washington State.   But all that is about to change. When Starbird gets her \"Calling\" to be a waitress at the Free Family’s restaurant in Seattle, she decides to leave behind the only home she’s ever known.    Nothing could have prepared Starbird for the World Outside, or for what it would teach her about the Family—and herself.   From the author of The Sweet Revenge of Celia Door comes this hilarious and poignant story about finding your true calling in life.",
