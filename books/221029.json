  "description": "They say that time helps you heal. Does it help you forget? Because I still remember. I still remember everything.Yet there I stood, in the back of the church, too tortured to make myself leave. I watched as she walked down the aisle toward a guy I knew was wrong for her – a guy who deserved to be punched in the face for even having the audacity to think he was on her level. And still I remember. I remember all of our moments, all of our memories, all of our collective images. Always on different pages. Always bad timing. Always the wrong place, the wrong time. All I'm left with from the past ten years are these images. They gutted me.But the image of her in white standing by a man that wasn't me, that was the worst image of all. It would torture me for the rest of my days, reminding me always that I am the world's biggest fool. Forever banished to the darkness.Author’s Note: This is the second book in the “Smile” Series. It is a stand-alone book and can be read without reading You Should Smile first, though this book will have character and plot references from the earlier book (as the timeline of this book crosses paths with Thad and Shay’s love story). This is a best-friends-to-lovers story, but it goes much deeper than that. It’s a story about long-term love that spans the course of a lifetime. Many years are covered in this book, so the characters will frustrate you. They will miscommunicate. They will do stupid things. Bear with them. This book also contains graphic sexual content and adult situations not appropriate for anyone under the age of 18.",
