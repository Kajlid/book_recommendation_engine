  "title": "Night Cruiser: Short Stories about Creepy, Amusing or Spiritual Encounters with the Shadow",
  "description": "What is “the shadow” in these stories? It’s what lurks in the dark, and it’s different for everyone.•\tFor Isabel, it’s the whisper from the basement that invites her to come on down.•\tFor second-grader Emma, it’s the tortured spirit that has haunted her family for generations.•\tFor Deacon William, it’s the damaged android that frightens visitors in the retreat house halls.All ten short stories in this collection are about how the different characters deal with what they find in the dark. Two of these stories received recognition from Writer’s Digest and others won awards or were published. They ask:•\tWhat’s inside the car that prowls a lonely street at night?•\tCan Brent save himself from the deadly creature he’s sure his wife has become?•\tDonald teaches a night class, but what’s behind those thick glasses he turns upon his shyest student?Night Cruiser offers an unusual perspective. With a background in pastoral ministry, the author bases her stories on insights from psychologist Carl Jung’s concept of the Shadow, from J.R.R. Tolkien’s belief that even the worst catastrophe can be redeemed, and from the faith of the medieval woman mystic Julian of Norwich.If you’re intrigued by the thing that takes shape at the foot of your bed at night, if you enjoy a little sly humor, if you crave tales that offer hope, and if you like stories that make you wonder, take a ride on the Night Cruiser.",
