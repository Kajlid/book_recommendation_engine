  "description": "The Devil is dead…or is he? The World rejoiced when the word spread like wildfire that ‘The Devil’ had finally been vanquished. Little did they know that sometimes it better to deal with the Devil himself than his Advocate. The World quickly learned that the only currency the Advocate wallowed in was red – the color of vengeance. In the end it was true, the ‘Devil’ was dead. An innocent man wore the face of someone who wandered the darker underbelly of life and made the shadows cringe. Trevor was a good Catholic boy who shared groceries with his elderly neighbors; walked their pets; worked an honest job and tried to write the next great novel as he made his way in the world. The problem now was that dark world found out that Trevor was still alive. Would the Devil’s Advocate be enough to protect the innocent or would Erik use this chance to revive the Devil of his dreams?Pb is 263 pages",
