And with the Tribunal unwilling or simply unable to help us, I'll do anything, even something really crazy, to get her back.With the help of my best friend and an alien smuggler I've captured, I've got a crazy plan. A plan that involves a neurotransmitter, a one-way ticket off of Earth, and a very powerful drug that will help me infiltrate an illegal alien slave market.I expect to be used, abused, and violated in my quest to gather evidence.What I don't expect is to be captured and claimed by a huge silver alien ... \nThis is a standalone book with a HEA.",
