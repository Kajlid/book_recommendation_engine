  "description": "A school field trip to the local Wetlands Unlimited marsh just outside the small prairie town of Milligan Creek, SK, gives best friends Matt, Chad, Dean, and Andrew a brilliant idea: hijacking the radio signal that transmits a recorded message about the marsh and using it to launch their own pirate radio station.
