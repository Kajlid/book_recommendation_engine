  "description": "At the dawn of creation, the world was beautiful and peaceful. Gods and humans lived in blissful tranquility together under the Heavenly Emperor's rule. But Taishakuten rebelled against the Emperor, and a turbulent age began. 300 years later, the Guardian Warrior of the northland (Yasha, the King of his tribe), hears astrologer Kuyou's last prediction: \"Six stars will strike the earth. You're the dark star that goes against heaven. Your journey begins when you find the child of a vanished race. I cannot see if the child is good or evil, but I know only this child can spin the wheel of heaven's destiny...\"",
