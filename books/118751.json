  "description": "Damascus, formally know as Christopher Wyse has been sent to Ireland, by his adoptive father Adonadus who is the leader of the LLF a terrorist group on the Greek Island of Lesbos, on a training mission with the IRA. Meanwhile Robert Wyse, who has been searching for his son Chris ever since the boy was abducted by the LLF fifteen years previously, has been tipped off about Damascus' mission with the IRA and so is hoping to make contact with Chris and perhaps free him from his bonds with the LLF. Along the way Damascus/Chris discovers that perhaps there is more to life than fighting in the LLF as he gets more involved with the IRA group he is assigned with, especially once he meets and falls in love with Breeda McBeamish.",
