  "description": "This winner of the 1955 Newbery Award, by the author of Shadrach and Hurry Home, Candy (both runners-up for the 1954 Newbery Award), is a masterpiece of story-telling, full of dramatic action and suspense.It all started because Lina, one of the six school children in the little Dutch fishing village of Shora, wrote a composition about storks. It was not a long composition, because Lina did not know much about storks. The storks never came to Shora to build their nests, as they did in the neighboring villages. Lina's composition set the children to wondering—Why didn't the storks come to Shora?—and sometimes when you begin to wonder Why? you can begin to make things happen.The children had to overcome many obstacles, and sometimes everything seemed to be against them, including the fierce and threatening sea. But because they wondered and believed and never gave up, they succeeded in doing the impossible; and the long dream—storks on every roof in Shora—began to come true.The black-and-white drawings by Maurice Sendak are a perfect complement to the text.",
