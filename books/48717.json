  "description": "\"Doing the right thing could destroy everything \"\"Tooth & Claw, Book 2\"Levi, Ian, and Darius escaped death-by-wolf-pack by the skin of their teeth, but they re not out of the woods. The wolves are relentless. Help from humans? Not likely. Their only hope is a vampire commune in remote western Canada if they make it in one piece. Even then, there s no guarantee they ll be offered sanctuary.First challenge is to get there. Sunlight is deadly. Money is dwindling. Police and wolves alike are on the hunt.Worse, Levi hasn't recovered physically or emotionally from the accident that broke several of his bones and killed his best friend. He desperately wants Ian or Darius to turn him, which would heal his wounds, speed their escape, and sever his last tie to the wolves that made his life hell.Yet Darius hesitates, caught between his desire to help his lover, and fear that once this is all over, Levi and Ian will have no use or desire to keep him in the picture. And that s assuming they all make it to the end of this aliveWarning: Contains two vampires and a werewolf who would really like to just sit down somewhere and lick their wounds, but are too damned busy stealing cars, avoiding sunlight, eluding police, arguing, jumping off roofs, and plotting new and innovative ways to weasel past customs. Oh, and plenty of scorching hot sex between three very, very dirty boys. \"",
