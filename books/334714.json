  "description": "Have you ever tried to change something about yourself but had a hard time making it stick? If so, Bonnie Grove knows how you feel. The problem, she explains, is that when it comes to self-improvement, most of us start by asking ourselves the wrong questions. Instead of, What are my weaknesses? How can I fix them? we should be asking, What are my strengths? How can I build on them?This book is not a one-size-fits-all approach to lifestyle change. It doesn t offer a ten-step formula or a one-minute prayer that guarantees success in 30 days. This book is about you. It’s about discovering and developing what you do well, what you love, and what brings you joy so you can see yourself the way God sees you and begin to truly receive His best for your life.Unlike some self-improvement books, you won’t be asked time digging around in the pastput your problems under a microscopetry and fix everything that’s ’broken’ in your lifeimprove on things you’re not very good atInstead, Bonnie gives you tools and resources to help what you’re good at—not what you think you should be good atdevelop your strengths and use them to offset your weaknesseslearn to recognize your true goals create a personalized map to follow as you begin your journey to becoming Your Best YouVisit thechangeroom.blogspot.com for more information about Your Best You from the author, Bonnie Grove.",
