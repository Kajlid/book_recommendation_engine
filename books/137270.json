  "title": "That Year in Boston",
  "description": "It was the year of the Boston Marathon bombing, the year of the Red Sox's championship, and the year the city's most prestigious publishing house was fighting for its life. It was the year Flo Wright relocated from New York to save Churchill & Co. and hired freelance editor, Nick Turner, to help her. But a hastily acquired memoir threatens disaster and sends the editors to Rio in search of the truth. Can Nick resist his powerful attraction to talented and seductive Flo who's already married? That year in Boston, fraught with dangerous love and tragic loss, changes their lives, and the city, forever.",
