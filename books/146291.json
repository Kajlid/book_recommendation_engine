  "description": "London1907, twenty years into the zombie PlagueReuben is a baker living in the slums of London, sharing a room with his father and an extended family of cockroaches. Poor, uneducated and repressing all his sexual desires, he leads a life of misery, only sometimes sprinkled with gin and a rough tumble in a filthy back alley. But when he is abducted into Bylondon, to be the slave of a wealthy crime family member - Erik Dal, his values are put to the test. His new master is obsessed with all things equestrian and Reuben soon learns that if he obeys and performs well as Erik’s horse, he might just get everything he yearns for: pampering, foods he never even dreamed of, and shameless sex with a demonically handsome young man in leather riding boots. As Copper, Erik’s treasured dun stallion, Reuben must submit to his new master’s obscene fancy of possessing another man completely. That is if he yearns for treats, not the lick of a riding crop. Fake tails, harnesses, and a new haircut to his ginger mane, help Reuben transform into Copper, but the fear of losing his dignity in the eyes of society might just prove to be a bigger restraint than any bit, bridle, or handcuffs. All that for the small price of his freedom. Though at times, Reuben feels it’s his soul that Erik is after.POSSIBLE SPOILERS:*Genre: m/m erotic romance, bdsmThemes: class differences, slavery, steampunk, alternative lifestyle, Victorian, master/servant, captivity, ponyplay, animalization, kink, organized crime, violenceErotic content: explicit m/m erotic scenes (including ponyplay)Length: ~95.000 words",
