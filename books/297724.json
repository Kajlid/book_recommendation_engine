Stefan has protected me from a disastrous date gone wrong, he's fixed my car, and he looks at me with so much heat I'm afraid I'll burn up from the inside...I don't understand him.Heated looks mean nothing without action, and Stefan still won't make a move -- until a strange man comes to town, asking questions about my past. I’m no one special, but Stefan’s determined to protect me. And since keeping me close involves lots of kisses, I’m not complaining.When a family secret shakes me to my core, I’m not sure if I’ll be strong enough to move forward with Stefan -- especially when he’s been keeping a fire breathing secret of his own. Can I really be the mate of a dragon?While \"Her Dragon Lover\" can definitely be read as a stand alone novel, this hot paranormal dragon shifter romance is best read as third in its series!",
