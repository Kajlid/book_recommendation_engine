  "description": "Hector, the mechanical champion of Troy, would like to think he's your average man. He's got good friends, a steady job fighting the foreign army that besieges his city, and a second chance at life following his disastrous duel with Achilles. What he doesn't have is a clue as to who murdered his brilliant resurrector. Now with the clock ticking down, he must race to solve the murder, fight the Greeks, put on a sold out play, and maybe even save the day once he sobers up a bit. Brilliantly conceived and executed, this gloriously irreverent reimagining of the ancient world will send readers on a wild ride through one of the strangest What If? scenarios to hit to the genre in decades.",
