  "title": "GloboChrist: The Great Commission Takes a Postmodern Turn",
  "description": "The information age has not only interconnected the world but has also shrunk it. This global dynamic impacts Christianity, especially the Great Commission. How do believers make disciples of all nations in this digital world of religious diversity? Carl Raschke, author of the acclaimed The Next Reformation, answers such questions in Globo Christ. He explores the impact of globalization, postmodernism, and information technology on missions and evangelism, as well as the role that Christianity plays in an increasingly pluralistic world. In short, he helps Christians respond to the tectonic shifts of the twentyfirst century. This third volume in the well received Church and Post modern Culture series is relevant to students, pastors, and all who care about the future of the church.",
