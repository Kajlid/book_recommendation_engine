  "title": "A Strange Machine",
  "description": "When Seattle’s most elite private school—alma mater of Bill Gates—becomes the controversial recipient of a prototype quantum supercomputer, senior class prankster and genius computer whizz Cory Holland is determined to hack it . . . that is, if he can find the time between crashing parties and making out with his archenemy’s superhot ex, Samantha.  But Cory soon realizes the spooky coffin-sized machine humming away in his school’s basement isn’t a computer at all. Inside the machine, time appears to cycle in endless loops. Food molds in seconds. Cell phones drain in minutes. Most startlingly, it appears possible to step inside at the end of the loop . . . and step out into the past.  But when the machine delivers a cryptic warning that Samantha died in a car crash, his memories of her instantly begin to vanish—leaving only lingering moments of déjà vu. Someone’s been screwing with the past. Now he must do the unthinkable: alter the timeloop to save the life of the girl he loves, only to forget everything about her.",
