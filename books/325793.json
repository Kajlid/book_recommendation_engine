  "description": "Listening Length: 19 hours and 55 minutes He'll mark her flesh. She'll claim his heart. Always the dutiful daughter, Lady Joselyn is weeks away from marrying a rival lord in order to save her house. However, she suddenly finds herself in the clutches of an ancient beast she’s only ever heard of in legends. More terrifying than that is the beast’s master, a wild man who insists Joselyn is his bride by right, and plans to seal his claim in blood. Dragon-rider Hollen has finally captured the woman of his dreams, though he quickly learns waiting for her was less than half the battle. His new bride wants nothing to do with him, and Hollen knows he only has one chance to change her mind. Their wills pitted against each other, Joselyn will go to any lengths to free herself from this savage and fulfill her marriage contract. Her father’s life depends upon it. To win her over, Hollen will do whatever he must, even if it means keeping secrets. Even as she plots her escape, Joselyn begins to wonder if one can also be bound by a duty to their own heart. Includes \"Sven the Collector\", a bonus story from The Dokiri Brides series.",
