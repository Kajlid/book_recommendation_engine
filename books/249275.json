  "title": "Elixir of the Ages",
  "description": "Elixir of the Ages is not your typical inner sphere epiphany book. Avoiding the usual platitudes and clich√©s of inner sphere epiphany books about healing and enlightenment, it focuses instead on the areas where Eastern philosophy and Western science interact. It is in this intersection that she finds wisdom and intelligence that is both ancient and contemporary, empowering and encouraging. Elixir of the Ages will distill two traditions that are often thought to be in opposition into a worldview that is in fact highly complementary and can reach across cultures and experiences to create a new pathway to understanding. Through a deep exploration of themes of identity, possibility, and persistence and transformation, Elixir of the Ages creates an unforgettable synthesis of the best of philosophy and metaphysics with the latest discoveries in neuroscience and behavioral studies.",
