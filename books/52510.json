But I am not defeated so easily” –That had been three years ago, after Dick Warboys had repulsed the invading Yela by firing a lithium bomb into the sun. but now that threat seems impending as scientists detect the rapid approach of a vast engulfing cloud of hydrogen. Warboys and his allies therefore set out in hot pursuit of the Yela into deepest space from Ursa Majoris, to save the Earth.",
