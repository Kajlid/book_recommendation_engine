  "description": "**Recommended for ages 18+ due to graphic language, sexual content, and mature subject matter.**  Kory Rosen has always known that he was different. That he wasn't the straight laced, responsible business man, like his brother Klay. He was the REBEL. The tattoo artist with a bad reputation. The man that would search for trouble if it didn't find him first. He'd never experienced a broken heart before. He'd always been the one breaking girl's hearts. Until now...  Kory has to learn to cope, and stop being the constant play-boy that spends his nights in a drunken stuper, and stop replacing one woman with random one-night stands. It's unhealthy, and it's not working. Real love is what he needs, or a good ass kicking. Either way he has to stop, or he'll lose it all; his business, his friends, and the one girl that just may be able to mend his broken heart.",
