  "title": "What I Can't Say",
  "description": "This collection of poetry is a raw and emotionally gripping tale told through a loose narrative style and imbued with Bell's passion and personality. It retains a beautiful and haunting style of composition in which we are given an unfettered look into the thought processes -however different than our own- of mental illness and the brutal honesty of it. The often lyrical style and lightness of the rhyme arrangements that juxtapose the weight of the concepts discussed within are powerful and unique among contemporary poems.",
