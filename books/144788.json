  "description": "Art Pepper told his sexy, sordid, and exciting true adventure stories to his lover, Laurie, who put them in a book. She quizzed him (and those who knew him) unrelentingly over seven years, editing and structuring a narrative to which she dedicated all her energy. \"Straight Life\" by Art and Laurie Pepper (Da Capo) was published in 1979. It was critical success and remains a classic of its kind, the subject of college literary and music studies. Laurie went on to marry Art and manage his resurgent career, touring the world with his band. \"Why I Stuck with a Junkie Jazzman\" was the headline some editor gave a newspaper interview Laurie did while the band was in Australia in 1981, and she's now stolen that \"that perfect title\" for her memoir. \"ART: Why I Stuck with a Junkie Jazzman \" (APMCorp), describes her marriage to the deeply troubled, drug-addicted, madly gifted artist. \"That marriage was the making of me,\" says Laurie. \"Some people go to grad school or join the Marines. I married a genius who valued and inspired me and challenged me to use MY gifts. We had a difficult, powerful partnership. I had to tell that story.\" She says she also needs to set the record straight and clarify her role: \"People think I was some kind of little wifey-saint who rescued him. And Art encouraged them in that. But he knew how truly crazy I could be. We rescued each other.\"",
