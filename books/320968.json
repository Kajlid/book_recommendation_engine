Continue your fast-paced binge read and enjoy the ride along this twisty, unpredictable plot.I’m back on the tennis court, but the rest of my life is a hot mess. My mom stopped paying my bills, and I just discovered the reason for it: she’s dead. I’m about to get kicked out of my apartment – the same one that’s been broken into twice – if I don’t pay rent soon. My sister is still lurking about, up to no good. And someone is leaving messages telling me to break up with Jude. He’s back from football camp and didn’t forget about me while he was gone. Jude’s seen the reality of my life, and he isn’t running away. Instead, he’s demanding I open up to him more, even though I’ve already made myself more vulnerable with him than with anyone else in my life. I keep telling myself it’s for his own good to keep secrets from him, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s more about protecting my heart than it is about proving my independence.We’ve fallen hard and fast, and it’s up to me what happens next.The man who’s come to deliver the news about my mom is about to tell me who my father is, and I have a feeling my world is going to get turned upside down. Should I take Jude’s hand and bring him along for the ride? And if I do, will having Jude beside me make me weaker, or stronger?",
