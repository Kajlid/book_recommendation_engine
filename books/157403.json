  "description": "The book is out of print: Hope and Life Press publishing, officially closing on May 15, 2018. \nFROM THE HEART - A JOURNEY OF LOVE\n is a collection of 56 poems, 14 haikus and various sayings by the Jordanian-American author and Huffington Post Passionista, Hadel S. Ma'ayeh. Described as haunting and timeless, innovative and jazzy, exquisitely balanced, with the ability to invade one's soul, Ma'ayeh's poetic voice paints an extraordinarily realistic picture of life in our postmodern age. The sensory words and emotions she uses effectively transport the reader to the settings described. The composition of the poems is sufficiently complex to provoke the reader into filling the blanks with their imagination, while being left wanting more.FROM THE HEART - A JOURNEY OF LOVE has been listed in Amazon's Hot New Releases in Middle Eastern Poetry.Early Reviews\"It takes a Sara Teasdale to employ words as few to skillfully paint the same old subject that society is and bring forth a work of art as fresh as Hadel's poetry is\" - Ouma Fred\"Haunting, timeless . . . the imagery Hadel employs invades your soul\" - Adan K.
