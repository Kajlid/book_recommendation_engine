  "description": "The Brona are sentient humanoid aliens, man's first contact, and at a technological level equivalent to our pre-industrial age. As a culture, the Brona offer no interest to humanity-that is, until it's discovered the foreskins of male Brona secrete a substance that has miraculous curative properties for humans. Aznan Calmere is a forerunner, a mercenary who is paid to obtain Brona foreskins no matter the cost. He's paid well to do it, too. Trouble is, getting to Brona Major is hazardous. On his latest trip, Aznan avoids a near miss, crashing on a Moon of Brona. There he runs into Lunore, a male Brona who shows Aznan the real damage being done to the Brona people because of the foreskin harvesting by the forerunners. When all is revealed, the Brona are not as simple as Aznan first thought. Will his new found respect lead to something unexpected? Will there be love? Or will there be war?",
