  "description": "Freed from her sheltered and repressive upbringing, Naomi McCoy decides to pursue her deepest sexual desires. After placing an online ad, she meets the older and more experienced Madame Véronique, who agrees to take her as her submissive and help her live out her many fantasies of being seduced, used and dominated. They are joined by Miss Connie, whose more aggressive style of dominance complements Madame’s more genteel approach, and soon other friends take part in fleshing out one erotic fantasy after another.",
