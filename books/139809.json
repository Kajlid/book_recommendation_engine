  "description": "Can love really conquer all? What if you met someone from an entirely different world who could change everything in your world -- and in ways you never imagined? “Central Park Song” explores that scenario and is an urban love story reminiscent of “Good Will Hunting,” “Pretty Woman,” and “Six Degrees of Separation.”Rodney is a passionate black man with brilliant talents but a mental illness that leaves him homeless. Melinda is a white Manhattan law partner with an artistic soul, trapped by the pressures of corporate law, her wealthy father, and her three-year boyfriend. A charming chance encounter leads to a magical courtship and life-changing choices that make an unlikely New York romance possible.WARNING: 1) this is a PG love story so there is NO HOT SEX in it, and 2) this is a screenplay (which means that it’s formatted differently, and written entirely in the present tense with an emphasis on actions and dialogue rather than inner thoughts). If that hasn’t scared you away yet, all purchase links will be posted here: http://tinyurl.com/CentralParkSong",
