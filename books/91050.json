His life’s mission was to rid the world of those abominations. However, when he meets the feisty, blonde-haired teen he’s going to have to choose between his feelings for a girl and his deeply ingrained hatred toward her race.Sabella begins to understand that it’s not always what you know that could get you killed ... it’s what’s in your blood.
