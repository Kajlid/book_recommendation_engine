In that time, she accepted 8 posts in 5 different countries: Niger, Haiti, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Iraq. This is Niger, where it all began.Part journal, part photo essay, part poem... deeply personal and deeply confronting... If you have ever wondered what this work is really like, read this book and you will know. \"Follow me now into the sands of the Sahel.\"Profits from the sale of this book will be donated to Doctors Without Borders Canada.",
