She's been involved first in a con game, then kidnapped by pirates and very nearly killed. Once the rescue is accomplished, it seems as though things might return to normal. But then people involved in Allison's trip through this dangerous time start dying mysteriously. First Taylor Duckworth, the ruthless con man dies in a fire. Then Ben's best friend Curt is shot down while flying from his gulf coast airport across southern Louisiana. It's time to reconsider their own safety as Ben and Allison combine forces again with one of Ben's Marine Corp friends and put an end to the fear.",
