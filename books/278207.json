  "description": "The war is over and Charlie Bassett is one of the brave young survivors. Haunted by one woman’s smile and by his wartime adventures, he finally returns back home to try to pick up the pieces of his broken life. There’s just one small problem—everyone thinks he’s dead. Arrested as a deserter, his only way out of prison is to work for a shadowy government agency monitoring the growth of Communism in post-war Europe. Special radio missions keep him busy in the air, while his all-female team, headed up by the icy Miss Miller, keeps his feet firmly on the ground. But then Charlie is forced to go undercover as a spy in a Communist group called the Rubble Rats. The government calls them the Red Menace, but Charlie finds a group of hard-working families just trying to get by—and his loyalties are torn. When he discovers that Grace Baker is one of them, Charlie must make some difficult decisions. For king and country? Or for the woman he once loved?",
