  "description": "Skella: A form-fitting black garment specifically tailored to cover a man's lean, muscular physique from head to toe. Worn exclusively by those in the king's personal guard. His Guardians. For Nelina Lannen, the skella is more than an outfit. It's a symbol of everything that's wrong with the royal rule. Ever since the king's men stormed into her bedroom eight years earlier and ripped her lover from her arms, she's been haunted by the memory of the ruthless bodyguards. That long-ago night they snatched the only man she's ever loved. Now they've returned to claim her body. Reader Advisory: Contains some scenes of male/male erotic interaction and group sex.",
