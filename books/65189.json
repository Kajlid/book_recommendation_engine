  "title": "Dancing in the Fountain: How to Enjoy Living Abroad",
  "description": "Living abroad is an opportunity to reinvent yourself that rarely exists outside the witness protection program. You get to hit the reset button on your life. Dancing in the Fountain takes its title from one blazing hot night when the author and her husband found themselves sitting on the edge of a big stone fountain. Dabbling their feet in the cool water, pretty soon they were wading, then dancing in the fountain. It's technically legal to do this on hot nights in Seville, but an old man passing by growled, \"Hey you two, is that any way to behave? You wouldn't do that back where you come from.\" And that's the whole point. Living overseas, you get to try things you'd never do back home.",
