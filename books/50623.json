  "description": "Damned by greedy Emperor Azmyth and his weak heir, Grand Prince Len, the Imperial Capital of Ay is winked out in one terrible moment by the mysterious Dark Destruction. Ill prepared for the rigours of leadership, Len leans upon his talented personal protector, Kai Canarbis, but as Kai spirits the unworthy imperial heirs through the disintegrating empire, in search of sanctuary and support, they must endure the karma of the Vallely dynasty’s crimes. Caught in arrogant, naive Len’s web, Kai seeks to disentangle his master out of an impending sticky mess, his only reward being his blossoming romance with Grand Princess Anna. However, having been badly wounded by the herald of the Dark Destruction, even the incredibly accomplished Kai falls victim to circumstance. A desperate, but doomed quest to save the empire leads across land, sea and ice, into enemy-occupied territory, but as the unfathomable Dark Destruction continues to ravage the realm, there might not be an empire remaining for anyone to claim.Website: https://sites.google.com/site/destiny...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/#!/TheDestin...Twitter: @acorok and @destinyofdragonFangs for the interest!",
