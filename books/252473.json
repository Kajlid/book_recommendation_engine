  "title": "#uncensored: inside the animal liberation movement",
  "description": "In her best-selling memoir, Camille Marino's astonishing odyssey rapidly unravels in raw and compelling narrative. Repeated arrests and censorship campaigns were designed to neutralize an influential activist. Relentless personal betrayals, cyber bullying, and sabotage, however, were designed to punish her for being a woman.When the author challenged those collecting millions of taxpayers' dollars to experiment on animals, she galvanized some very powerful adversaries. Rising to become a controversial and high-profile leader, she quickly learned that legal terrorism and corresponding prosecutions were an occupational hazard. Oblivious to the smoldering resentment of her peers -- reigning male demagogues -- she was slower to realize that she had been sleeping with the real enemy all along. One-time friends turned tormentors, undertaking virulent campaigns of cyber bullying, stalking, harassment, and defamation. Ms. Marino would have to face and overcome her own private inadequacies to regain her composure and finally taste victory. Sometimes we only find our own core of strength and personal empowerment when we have no other choice.",
