  "description": "When Emory De La Cruz heads out the door to the first day of his college statistics course, he’s just thinking about powering through the semester to get done with the last math requirement he needs for his degree. He’s not anticipating group projects, making friends, or meeting a cute boy... When Takashi Bennett arrives late to his first day of statistics, he’s just glad there is one seat left in the class. He’s not expecting to see a quietly powerful punk rock skater in the next row over. He’s two semesters from graduation, he doesn’t need any drama...Navigating college, familial obligations, cultural expectations, and love is a handful. Trying to do all of it in the Bay Area, with a whole umbrella of genders and sexualities and non-monogamists to figure out is another handful. How does love work in the culture of now?",
