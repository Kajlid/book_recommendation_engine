They are assailed by a new being a man is not a virtue; it is a liability.Speaking into that bleak picture, Brett Murray presents a fresh revelation of God's heart for men. \"Your Game Plan,\" infused with hope from the very first page and presents the truth as it's found in the bible.God knows each man's days even before they've drawn a single breath.
