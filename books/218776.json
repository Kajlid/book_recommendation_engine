  "description": "What kind of a woman would sell her own child? A monster. Tess was just eleven years old when her mother sold her to a rich elderly man. Grace ran a brothel in Croydon and she plunged her young daughter into a terrifying world of sex and depravity. Grace was absolutely ruthless in her pursuit of money and had a toxic mix of low cunning and high ambition. Dangerous criminals visited the brothel every day, and Tess was exposed to things no little girl should see. A timid child who longed for her mother's love, she grew up in a world of unimaginable horrors with no one to turn to. Her mother ensured that Tess followed her footsteps and began selling herself. She later opened a brothel too, but became known for looking after her girls and running it as cleanly and as fairly as she could. Along the way she encountered some fascinating characters, including Christine Keeler, the Kray twins and Myra Hindley, as well as numerous well-known actors and politicians. Amazingly, after such a horrendous start in life, Tess has left prostitution and completely turned her life around. HOW COULD YOU DO IT, MUM? offers readers a heart-wrenching and shocking insight into a criminal underworld and is a compelling account of one woman's recovery from the ultimate betrayal.",
