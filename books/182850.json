  "description": "“It was a self-portrait with me standing in front of a wall-size mirror and staring at my reflection. I had a confused face because what I could see in the mirror was not what was actually around me. It depicted a basement on which I was standing. The mirror made me feel that a whole lot of other things existed around me. I could not see them though. But I had an explanation for them. It could only mean one thing: that they existed as a part of a different dimensional world!”",
