  "title": "The Solitary Woman of Shakespeare",
  "description": "When seventeen-year-old Abigail Walker, desperate to escape her family and her tedious factory job in the East, responds to the ad, “Man in Territory seeks correspondence with adventurous gal,” she thinks she’s found her ticket to love and freedom. She falls in love with Henry through the romantic letters he sends her about his home in the West and agrees to travel to Shakespeare to become his wife. Instead she finds herself lured to a rough mining town and twice-deceived. First, she is the sole woman ever to set foot in Shakespeare. Secondly, her betrothed is not the poetic Romeo of the love letters, but Henry, an elderly saloon keeper and former outlaw.",
