  "description": "James Riddell maintains that never in his life has he seen as much water as during his lone journey across Africa in the rainy season. This book is an account of that journey through east Africa, Nyasaland, the game country of the northern Transvaal, and part of the union. Mr Riddell is not a de-luxe traveller, nor a conventional one. He chugged down the Zambezi to the Indian Ocean on an old river boat; he flew in a private aeroplane over a flooded game reserve; and climbed the Mlanje Mountain, where he lived for four days on tablets only - just to prove it was possible! Here is a traveller who kept his eyes - and his mind - wide open, and adds diverting observations to his story on a variety of subjects including the development of Nyasaland and the problem of the eternal black/white relationship. With its excellent photographs, this book makes good reading for either real or armchair travellers.",
