  "description": "Thirteen-year-old Sadie lives alone with her mum in their seaside bed and breakfast. Her mum thinks Sadie doesn’t try hard enough at anything she does, and her teachers think she’s lazy. As for Sadie herself—she can’t believe that she’s any good at anything, even though she tries so hard. Suddenly her mum becomes seriously ill and Sadie is left all on her own in charge of the B&B. There are guests arriving at any minute, and she has absolutely no idea how to make a bed, let alone cook them a fried breakfast. How will she cope? Marcus, the techno-geek from next door, tries to help, as does her feisty and clever best friend Kate, but ultimately it is Sadie who is put to the test as she copes with more than she ever thought possible.Hilarious, moving, and poignant, this is a wonderful story about a girl who overcomes all odds and achieves success in more ways than one.",
