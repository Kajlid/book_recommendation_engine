  "title": "Fakebook: A True Story, Based on Actual Lies",
  "description": "On October 5th, 2009, Dave posted a note on Facebook announcing that he was quitting his job, dropping everything, and walking west. But what no one knew (save a few collaborators) was that Dave was lying and that his westward travels were all an elaborate hoax.And so Dave's existence split in two--earning his followers' trust with postings about everyday activities before escalating the story with tales of teepeeing an Amish horse and buggy and thus being forced to work off his debt on the farm. Meanwhile, the real Dave went into hiding, sequestering himself in his parents' empty house and growing more and more lonely.This humorous, thought-provoking memoir will spark discussions of our social media culture and its impact on our relationships and interactions.",
