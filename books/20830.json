  "title": "Ecology & Liberation: A New Paradigm",
  "description": "Taking cues from science as well as mystical traditions, Boff finds that interrelatedness forms the key to a new paradigm. He critiques common approaches to ecology and discerns in the growing ecological awareness, and in the search for spirituality and meaning, the seeds of an alternative to a world of alienation, inequality and escalating natural destruction.",
