  "description": "In 1980, B. J. Rosenthal's only mission is to find himself a boyfriend and avoid setbacks like bad haircuts, bad sex, and Jewish guilt. In post-AIDS 1986, B.J.'s world has changed dramatically -- his friends and lovers are getting sick, everyone is at risk, and B.J. is panicking. Parrying high-wire wit against unbearable human tragedy, Eighty-Sixed now stands as a testament to an era. \"If Woody Allen were gay and wrote novels, he'd produce something like David Feinberg's Eighty-Sixed.\" -- David Streitfeld, The Washington Post Book World \"[Feinberg] has given us a painful story of one man coming of age in a terrifying age.\" -- The Plain Dealer (Cleveland) \"Entertaining, harrowing, and powerfully unsensational.\" -- Booklist \"[Eighty-Sixed] stands out for its frankness, ferocious wit, and total lack of sentimentality or self pity.\" -- Catherine Texier, The New York Times Book Review",
