There is peace now with dragons and humans having signed a treaty. Things changed because the dragons realised that they could mate with humans and this brought humans off the menu and into their lives. Of course there is still cultural and species interactions that are confusing and amusing. This is a series of short stories about these interactions between dragons and the women they have chosen to be their mates.",
