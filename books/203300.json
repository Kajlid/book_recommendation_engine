  "description": "Murderous thoughts. Those are what I had once Isabella walked through the door and revealed to me who she was. I needed an escape. An escape from my thoughts, an escape from the hurt, and an escape from ... him.  I was a broken woman, but I was never going to break my resolve. I grew up being a fighter because I had to. No man could ever bring me down... Not even Luca.  But, I had to admit, I never thought my heart would break as much as it did that day. Of course, I fled, but I was a fool to think he would ever let me go. He always told me I was his ... no matter what the cost. He was determined to keep me—regardless of the lengths he had to go to reach his goal. He was like a moth to my flame, a tattoo carved into my heart. I could never escape his pull.  I may have evaded him, but I knew it would just be a matter of time. Once he inevitably caught up with me, there would be no going back.  However, no matter what I had expected—or even imagined—absolutely nothing could have prepared either of us for what happened next...",
