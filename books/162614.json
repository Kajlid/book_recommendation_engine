  "description": "This is first in a series of books, which I am calling Novelets as I am aiming to keep each story to approximately 10,000 words or so. The series will always feature a lesbian woman named Vanity Bench as the main character. Thus the selection for the series name \"The Tales of Miss Vanity Bench). The first story begins with her entering an all girls college, in the fall of 1941 as a Freshman. I opted to a bit of humor in this story, through the use of names of people and places. As this is a work of fiction, I will leave it up to the reader to draw their own connections based on the names I have come up with.",
