  "title": "Why?: The Best Ever Question and Answer Book about Nature, Science and the World around You",
  "description": "Everyday childhood activities, such as an excursion to the park, splashing in the bathtub, or fixing a snack in the kitchen, can excite many questions in young children. Why is the sky blue? Why does my stomach g-r-r-owl? Why do cows moo? Curious kids want to know, and no adult has all the answers. The tenth anniversary edition of Why? provides child-friendly explanations for nearly 100 of these everyday mysteries for a whole new generation of children. Why? takes young readers inside the kitchen and out to the park, from the farm to the supermarket, and from bathtime to bedtime. Bright, playful illustrations by Scot Ritchie are the perfect complement, setting the scenes for the common questions that children ask.",
