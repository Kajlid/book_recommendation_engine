  "description": "The dead have risen, and they are hungry. They are tough, they are lethal, and they are everywhere. Savage packs of the undead wander the world, feeding on the living. And they are getting stronger... In Brattleboro, Vermont, John Mason and his beautiful young wife Sara believe that family can survive anything. When the apocalypse arrives they pack food, clothing, and weapons, then hit the road with their dog seeking refuge in the mountains of John's youth. There John and Sara, together with family, friends, and neighbors, build a stronghold against the encroaching mass of the dead. The mindless walking dead are only the beginning of their troubles in this new, violent world. Something darker still is moving, and John, Sara, and the other survivors must unite and fight together or be torn apart by this New Zed Order.",
