  "description": "This is the sequel to It's All in the Details. Peter has returned to Wabash for his sophomore year of college. If he thought his freshman year was too much to handle, then this year will completely take him by surprise. He and Dave are now together, but several things command Peter's attention. First, he has a more leadership role in the Phi Delta Gamma house, even bigger than he had anticipated. Then the world outside of college invades and creates problems for everyone in the house. Peter tries his best to cope, but sometimes a lawsuit, a job opportunity, and a death are just too much to handle.",
