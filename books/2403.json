  "description": "Investment analyst Lynn Gregory was used to taking risks. But even Lynn has her doubts when Matt, her best friend, asks her to participate in a charade to hide his sexuality from his parents. The plan seemed simple enough - Matt would introduce his friend Chris as his fiance. All Lynn has to do was back up the story. As the three grow closer, Lyn is forced to decide if she is willing to make the riskiest investment of all, an investment in which she may lose her heart.",
