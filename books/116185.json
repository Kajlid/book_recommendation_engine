  "description": "Guardian AngelWhen the mutants of the Mars and Venus colonies sought independence, the World Council tried to protect Earth's interests. But even bigger things were at stake: Full-scale war would attract the attentions of the deadly Denebian aliens, who were slowly advancing towards Earth.Only David Raven - and a few others like him - knew about the Denebians. But Raven had powers no human or mutant had every[sic] dreamed of, and he was looking out for humanity...[From Back cover][Front Page]Pawn to KingThe notion of a supertelepathic superlevitator was patently absurd - but the opposition would swallow the absurdity when it came along in the guise of a self-evident fact. There would be considerable boosting of blood pressure in the hidden Venusian hierarchy when they learned that the first act of Earth's new chess piece was to abolish a natural law.The thought gratified him. To date he had achieved nothing spectacular by the standards of the day and age. That was good because it was highly undesirable to be too spectacular. But at least he'd created considerable uneasiness in the ranks of the formerly overconfident enemy. Indeed, if they had bolted this multitalent mutant notion and speculated on the dire possibility of still more formidable types yet to come, they would have every reason to feel afraid.It was a pity they could not be told the truth.",
