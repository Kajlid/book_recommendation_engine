  "description": "At the age of ten, Serge Gnabry was wanted by some of the biggest football clubs in the world. His route to superstardom looked clear. But after struggling to break into first teams, potentially career-ending injuries and an infamously disastrous loan spell, Serge had to fight to become Bayern Munich's deadliest weapon and Germany's brightest light. Follow him on his extraordinary journey to the top. Sometimes, when that journey isn't smooth, the result only makes it all the more worthwhile. This fictionalised biography is one of the new titles in Ransom's Tales from the Pitch series. Each book focuses on one up-and-coming football superstar, often players who are still to reach the summit of their career. The players are from all walks of life and have faced failure, injury and rejection, making these moving and inspirational stories. The books are brimming with football banter that will have the knowing fans smiling. And each players story is littered with football tricks and tips, so readers can learn the arts of the glorious game. Tales from the Pitch are easy to read and very fast-paced reads. At only 120 pages long, printed on cream paper with a dyslexia-friendly font, these are ideal books for reluctant and dyslexic readers.",
