It is passion that energizes and sparks the pull forward through all barriers, uncertainty, and challenges.On this journey, we are asked to turn inward and search for the invisible, the hidden, and the sacred possibilities in order to claim what is ours in truth. We will then fill that shell with a desire that will ignite its creation.May this book serve as your guide on how to evoke this clarity and desire for your most authentic path enabling you to create a vision for your future that will bring you the ultimate sense of fulfillment. In addition, this book will show you the steps to navigate the path forward toward this new dream giving you the opportunity to awaken innate abilities you didn't know you had that will open the door to success.",
