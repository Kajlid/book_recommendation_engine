  "description": "Can the invisible walls that separate people ever come down?In 1933, Anna Leibowicz is convinced that the American dream that brought her Jewish family here from Poland is nothing but an illusion. Her father has vanished. Her dreams of college can't make it past the sweat-shop door. And when she discovers to her shame and horror that she's with child, her mother gives her little choice but to leave. Deciding her best course of action is to try to find her father, she strikes out...hoping against hope to somehow redeem them both.When Anna stumbles upon a house full of orphan boys in rural Indiana who are in desperate need of a tutor, she agrees to postpone her journey. But she knows from the moment she meets their deep-hearted caretaker, Thomas Chandler, that she doesn't dare risk staying too long. She can't afford to open her heart to them, to him. She can't risk letting her secrets out.All too soon, the townspeople realize she's not like them and begin treating her with the same disdain they give the Sisters of Mercy--the nuns who try to help Thomas and the boys--and Samuel, the quiet colored boy Thomas has taken in. With the Klan presence in the town growing ever stronger and danger to this family increasing the longer she stays, Anna is torn between fleeing to keep them safe...and staying to fight beside them.Oh, that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest...",
