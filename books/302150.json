  "description": "Joe Carducci was an integral member of the SST Records family when it was at its peak. This experience gave Carducci a unique perspective on music and \"Rock And The Pop Narcotic\" is perhaps the only book of popular music criticism that attempts to achieve a genuine aesthetic of rock music. The content runs the gamut of music, touching on everything from the Allman Brothers to Husker Du to Black Flag.",
