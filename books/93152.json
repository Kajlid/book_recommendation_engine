  "description": ": In the first volume of The Adventures of The Princess and Mr. Whiffle, we learned what lurks beneath our beds. What's more, we learned that little girls are not helpless, and that princesses are not always what they seem. In this second installment of the Princess's adventures, we learn a little more about the Princess's family. We learn how dark it is in the Deep Belowâ€¦ And we learn what happens when the Princess gets a little brother. The Adventures of The Princess and Mr. The Dark of Deep Below is a dark twist on the classic children's picture book. Perfect for geek children and adults who love dark faerie tales, international bestselling author Patrick Rothfuss has described the Princess's adventures as, 'Calvin and Hobbes meets Coraline, with a healthy dose of Edward Gorey mixed in.'",
