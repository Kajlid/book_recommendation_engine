  "description": "The greatest gift is getting what you never thought you wanted.Mitch Magruder, rich, successful, wildly popular surfer and entrepreneur, is always on the lookout for the next big wave or the next great deal. So when he s home for the holidays, he jumps at the chance to build one of his famous hotels right on the white, sandy, Florida beach where he grew up. The only thing standing in his way is Greta Mason. Divorced with two children, Greta welcomes the struggle to make ends meet at the ramshackle beachfront motel her father left her. The motel means everything to her, and no amount of money or hot nights of persuasion offered by gorgeous, sexy Mitch is going to change her mind. No matter how much his touch unravels her defenses. For once, Mitch finds he's the one doing the chasing, and Greta s doing more than throwing a monkey wrench into his perfectly orchestrated world. She's making him think about things he's never considered before, things other than the pursuit of money. Things like settling down with the right woman. Now if only he can convince her he wants more than hot sex, moonlit nights, and her hotel.",
