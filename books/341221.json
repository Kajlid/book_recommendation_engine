  "description": "Membership has its wicked little privileges!During five years working for the Department of Defense, aerospace engineer Sedona Stewart has given up her personal life (along with her libido) for her job. But there's no promotion in sight...unless she joins The Membership—a secret men's club where members are promoted according to their sexual escapades! But then, much to the joy of her inner seductress, Sedona discovers she's to spend the next few weeks in California, working closely with Lieutenant Commander Angel Torres—a top-notch pilot, and walking sex-in-a-flight-suit. And while the club suspects she's working toward a 'promotion,' they have no idea just how far Sedona will go... Or that she'll enjoy every sizzling minute!",
