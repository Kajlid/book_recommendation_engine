  "description": "The story is set among a tree-lined, middle class community, unspoiled, neighborhood friends playing safely on the sidewalks. Precisely at five-thirty, well-behaved daddies rush home to kiss their wives, and all is right with the world. The only problem is, nothing is as it seems. Secret sins and obsessions live in unseen places...in fact, how well do you know your own next-door neighbors? Join the life of a pretty, southern misfit with the uncanny ability to read greed and lust inside those who are up to no good. But what's a regular, young girl to do about it? With no one to take her side, her help will come from a most uncommon source! You'll cringe and you'll cry, but no doubt share a few good laughs along the way. In a heartrending twist, the girl who can see what others can't-- is herself blind to the secret that will bring her own family to its knees. Reader beware, this isn't just another, typical Monday.",
