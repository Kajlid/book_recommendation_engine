As he reacquaints himself with the present, he must discover his identity and come to terms with a past that haunts his dreams. Who is Ernest Featherstone? Why can he not remember?Part satire, part traditional literary dystopia, Immemorial is a dark and witty exploration of identity, morality, religion and relationships against a backdrop of an England in turmoil.",
