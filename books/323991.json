  "description": "When I decided to move across the country for college, I thought it’d be the perfect chance to reinvent myself.But then one party changed the course of my entire freshman year.And just when I think I’m about to drown in the foggy memories of my night spent partying at the football house, Daniel Bridges walks into my life.Lindon University’s wide receiver.A total flirt. And a total threat.Because he can help take away the memories I do remember from that night.What I don’t anticipate from the witty football player is the friendship we form as the months go on.Or how easy it is to fall for him as he teaches me how to trust again…and so much more.",
