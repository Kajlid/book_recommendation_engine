  "description": "IN TIME It never occurred to ALLIE WINTERS that there was something different about Evermore -- the small town that she was forced to spend five days in because her car had to be fixed. Yes, it was quaint and yes, it seemed maddeningly out of step with the current times, but it was nevertheless like all those other \"remember when\" towns she had visited -- people in different era clothing, out-of-date music playing on the radio, roads that were only semi-standard and no modern conveniences to be seen or heard. In other words, just another tourist trap. But was it? The clues were always there for Allie but in the beginning she misreads them and thinks she has come upon yet another \"restored\" town that Americans like to visit during summer vacations. When she finally understands that by some strange trick of fate she has actually entered a time warp -- it’s only August, 1941, in Evermore, it’s too late for her to just leave without a backward glance for she has already fallen in love with the editor of the town's weekly newspaper: NOAH WILSON, in the course of only a few days, has won her heart in a thousand small ways -- from his low-key acceptance of life to his almost extraordinarily old-fashioned ways of loving her.IN TIME is a love story of two people who, through some \"window in time\" are able to meet, get to know each other, fall in love and then understand that that love -- though they don't know how -- will be bound forever and ever throughout eternity.",
