  "title": "The Evolutionary Revolution",
  "description": "Fiction. What if evolution was decided by committee and revolution by mere chance? What if man was a subspecies? What if man, as a subspecies, was woman, with tiny red wings on her thighs and pasted shut eyes? What if she flew in the sky or slept on the moon, and what if the earth was a saltless water world filled with forgetful, vengeful two-headed mermen? Welcome to THE EVOLUTIONARY REVOLUTION, a fabulist story of sense-making for the 21st century. In this twinning tale of freak shows and prophets, tract homes and impending doom, award-winning author Lily Hoang collapses time and narrative into a brilliant novel of beginnings and ends, where sentences undo each other and opposites don't cancel each other out. As Anna Joy Springer notes in the book's introduction, \"In literature, as sometimes in life, it's a scary kind of fun to be manipulated by a pretty girl, who changes the game on a whim.\"",
