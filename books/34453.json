  "title": "Norse Romance III: Hærra Ivan (Arthurian Archives)",
  "description": "Hærra Ivan (Sir Ivan, the Knight with the Lion) is the first major work of fiction in Swedish, and an important Scandinavian example of Arthurian romance. The translation from the French original was carried out at the request of the German-born Queen Eufemia of Norway, a country with a richer literary culture than Sweden at the Hærra Ivan thus brought Continental, courtly culture to the then recently formalised Swedish feudal class. Last edited in 1931, the poem has been unjustly neglected in recent years; this new edition and English translation, with introduction, will make it widely accessible to international scholars. Professor MARIANNE KALINKE teaches in the Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; HENRIK WILLIAMS teaches in the Department of Scandinavian Languages at Uppsala University.",
