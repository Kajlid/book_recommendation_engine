And after years of letting his friends down time after time, Ozzy knows he’s the last person anyone should count on.When Tris’s search for his lost younger brother lands him in a small town at an overly-friendly Bed and Breakfast, everyone, including the B and B herself, seem to be pushing Tris and Ozzy together.Tris learned a long time ago, under the fists of his manipulative step-father, that family can’t be trusted, and love means nothing. Torn between the desire to see Tris thrive in his new home, and the need to protect the very younger brother Tris came looking for, Ozzy has some hard choices ahead.Welcome back to Griffon's Elbow and The Oaks B&B, aka Mildred. She's not the only sentient house in town.",
