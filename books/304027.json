  "description": "From Wall Street Journal and USA Today bestselling author Dylan Allen comes a new story in her Rivers Wilde series…“I dare you to let me watch.”It was the most wicked of propositions.He was the most devilish of men…And my soon to be boss.I’d be crazy to say yes.And a fool to say no.Rich, and reckless, - Tyson Wilde is the kind of man I’ve sworn to avoid.The offer he makes me - no limits, no strings, no regrets - is too good to be true.On any other night, in any other city, and if he’d been even a fraction less mouthwatering, I might have been able to say no.But it’s my birthday, I’m in Paris, and the devil holding out his hand to me has a killer smile, wears a suit like it’s his job, and oozes spine-tingling sex appeal.And despite years of trying to be good, I’m a sinner at heart.It’s a night I’ll never forget… and always regret.Because no matter how right our kisses feel,We’re only pretending to be lovers to land this deal…It doesn’t matter that he understands me better than anyone ever has -There are some secrets I will not share.And lies he’ll never forgive.Falling in love with Tyson Wilde was a danger I never saw coming,And it could cost me everything.**Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**",
