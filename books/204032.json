  "title": "Burned",
  "description": "Sometimes playing with fire is worth the burn.     Katie:  He is a very bad man. There is nothing good about him… Unless you count the things he does to me between the sheets. Those are good, very good. Everything else about him is bad to the core. One drunken night of bone-melting sex should have been the end of it—especially since I woke up alone. Until he shows up at my door complete with handcuffs. I hate him for what he’s doing. Too bad my body can’t resist him.  Torch:   She has a body that makes men beg. I had to have her. I didn’t realize getting my dick wet inside of her would be a drug---one I’d crave over and over. Katie’s past brings me to her door. I should walk away. I can’t. My President asked me to do this job and technically, I am. I’m doing her against the wall, in the shower, on the counter, the table and occasionally even the bed. The heat between us is intense and white-hot like an open flame. I can’t walk away, even for my President, the man I swore to follow into hell. I warned her I am no one’s happily ever after. I’m too dark. I’m more of a nightmare. She chose to play with fire. Hell, I did too. It’s too late, now we’ll both be BURNED",
