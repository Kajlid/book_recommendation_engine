  "description": "Ever wonder what it would be like to see the greatest players in baseball history playing against one another? Could ballplayers excluded from the league due to the color of their skin really compete against their white counterparts? Could a dead ball pitcher strikeout a millennial?These were all questions that went through the mind of Dr. Tony Johnson in the summer of 1999. A lifelong fan of the game, Dr. Johnson dreamed of watching the legends of baseball take the field once again. After nearly 20 years of research, Dr. Johnson and his team of engineers discovered a way to make his dream a reality.The summer of 2017 would become the ultimate year of baseball as the greatest players of all time took the field one last time.",
