  "description": "In the land of nightmares, she finds the man of her dreams... He haunts her in her dreams.  She is always searching, looking for the man who calls her from afar, a disembodied voice who knows everything about her.  But when she discovers the unimaginable secret her family has hidden for so long, her dreams—and her nightmares—invade her reality. Her true love beckons, but the terrors await her. . . . Can she find him in time, or will their love—and her life—be destroyed? Sixteen-year-old Iris has a recurring dream a long corridor of many doors, and behind each door a hidden world—some magical, some terrifying. But always she is searching for the man who calls to her—the man of her dreams—who knows everything about her, who stirs feelings in her she’s never felt before. When she discovers her father is actually the god of dreams, her nightmares and dreams follow her into reality, with both frightening and romantic results. Hunted by the god of nightmares, stalked by the horrifying creatures of the underworld, Iris must try to navigate both her worlds, as she tries to finally be with Sebastian, the man of her dreams. Can she triumph over the dangers that have haunted her forever, and be with Sebastian, or will terrors ultimately destroy them both?",
