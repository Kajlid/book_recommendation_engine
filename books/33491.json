Putting a city on edge with fears of a terrorist on the loose, the Bomber will become journalist Annika Bengtzon's biggest story - or the final nail in her coffin.Set against the breathtaking landscape of the Swedish winter, THE BOMBER draws in readers like the dark and edgy eye of a TV camera at a nighttime crime scene, delivering a climax that's a blasting cap on a short fuse, ready to detonate a reporter's world.Liza Marklund's extraordinary writing, bone-chilling plot and irresistible heroine have created an international phenomenon as explosive as the Bomber's devastating blasts.",
