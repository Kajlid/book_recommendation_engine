  "description": "This book is entitled ‘Cabbie with a Dangerous Mind’ for a reason, mainly because it’s the story of Billy, an East London cab driver who’s been diagnosed with Bipolar and who suffers manic episodes while driving his cab around London.He has elevated mood swings and uncontrollable depression, and because his manic states often turn into psychotic episodes, Billy begins to suspect that the label ‘bipolar’ is just a cop-out from the medical fraternity because they don’t know what to do with him. He realises he’s possibly a psychotic depressive or even a schizophrenic, and yet he has no one to turn to.His one love is Jelly, a drug addict, although neither of them realise how much they’ve come to rely on each other.Billy’s life is unravelling fast. He’s prone to violent rages, and his distortion can change whilst driving as time slows down and speeds up again and buildings starts to move. Billy writes with intelligence about his life, and the advice that you really shouldn’t be getting in his cab is sound. Billy has suicidal thoughts whilst driving. The book is peppered with characters; oddballs, weirdoes, comedians, eccentrics, head cases, prima donnas and hard cases …… and they’re just the drivers!‘Cabbie with a Dangerous Mind’ will make you laugh, cry and hopefully raise awareness of Mental Health issues in the community.
