But when you're Buffy Summers, a vampire slayer--the Chosen One (with all that entails)--building a new life can be overwhelming. A group of nerdy vampires, shunned by their cooler brethren, decide to climb the vampire social ladder by taking out the Slayer. They play on Buffy's insecurities, wearing her down until she is full-on distracted by the mental warfare. But in addition to her Watcher, Giles, this Slayer has a couple of new friends, Willow and Xander, to cheer her on . . . except, of course, when they're not getting along.Award-winning author Faith Erin Hicks (The Adventures of Superhero Girl) brings the angst, the action, and the cool to Buffy the Vampire Slayer!",
