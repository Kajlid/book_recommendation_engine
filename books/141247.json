It seems that nothing can stand in their way and that humanity will become cattle for the harvesting, the source of the blood of life.People aren't even safe from their own kind. Human 'cowboys' enlisted by the vampires herd other humans in return for the promise of the bite of eternal life - someday.The vampire forces have come to a small town in coastal New Jersey to finish pacifying the area. Dan, a disgraced priest accused of abuse, hides out and drinks, waiting for the end - until he is galvanized into action by his niece, who has fled the collapse of New York; a rabbi; and a nun who has become a killer of both cowboys and vampires. Together, they fortify an abandoned church and defy the conquering swarm. A surprising success shows them a ray of hope for humanity's survival, but an overwhelming challenge stands in their way - the new vampire King of New York.",
