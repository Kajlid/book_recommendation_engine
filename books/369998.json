  "title": "Hooray for Holopticon",
  "description": "A lighthearted adventure set in a future world not too different from our own. The paranoid Tax Authority, afraid of a wonderful new product developed by Holopticon (maker of holographic viewers), starts a bureaucratic war with the brave little company. With backup from the home office, three resourceful Holopticon employees beard the agency in its den. But despite exploding toilets, omnivorous ducks, bad computer poetry, and occasional appearances by a mythical ninja detective, most everyone manages to have a pretty good time. As Holopticon's (maddening) office computer might say \"They bite bureaucracy on the nose / And come out smelling like a rose.\" Think Jane Austen meets Ocean's Eleven meets Office Space. PG-13, with a tight, satisfying plot and some very funny scenes.",
