  "description": "You were amazed by his Harvey Award-winning run on THE MUPPET SHOW. You thrilled to his run on THOR: THE MIGHTY AVENGER. Now the next great Roger Langridge graphic novel series begins as he brings Lewis Carroll's imaginative world to new heights in a side-splitting adventure that can only be explained as...SNARKED! Presenting a fresh and incredibly modern \"Langridge\" spin on an already-warped classic, SNARKED starts here in an epic adventure featuring the Red Queenâ€™s children, Princess Scarlett and her baby brother Rusty, as they set out in search of the missing Red King. And who better to help guide the way than the Walrus and the Carpenter from THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS. That's right, the same Walrus that inspired the Beatles song \"I Am the Walrus\" is now in Roger Langridge's merry, mad hands for new all ages adventures at KABOOM!",
