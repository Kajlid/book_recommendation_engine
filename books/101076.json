  "description": "Twenty-five years ago, a Human and a Shaper fell in love. Then the unthinkable happened and started a wedge that would drive them apart. Now, they are back in the same area and facing a danger that threatens their very lives while a bond that can't be broken attempts to reassert itself. Join Scott and Armida in a race against time to stop an old foe playing on the prejudices that span centuries. Enjoy the ride as they fight for their rights in a world where Vampires are more accepted than they are. Love in a world where finding a mate could be a death sentence from her people, and that is just a typical Monday. Welcome to the world of the Michigan Shapers.",
