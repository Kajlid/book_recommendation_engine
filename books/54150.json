While collecting firewood, Dessa happens upon a kidnapping and manages to boldly rescue the captive boy and bring him to safety. Once out of harm's way, the boy reveals that he is Paladin, the crown prince of Medoria! Upon Paladin's safe return to his kingdom, his father, King Victor the Fourth, decrees three days of celebration in tribute to the three heroes who have saved his precious only son. Dessa, Topper and Fisk know they are taking a risk by remaining in the castle for all that time, but how can they refuse the king? And to make things trickier still, is the charming prince falling for Dessa?The cinematic artwork in this series offers a fully visual experience for young readers looking for an exciting tale of adventure, told in episodes. Dessa's derring-do is on display once again as she's seen swinging into action to save the prince's life (twice!), among other exploits. The fast pace alone is enough to keep young readers turning the pages. Creator Scott Chantler has also crafted a tremendously intriguing fantasy world in these books, fleshing out the intricacies a bit more with every installment. The layers and connections between characters promote critical thinking, while the masterful storytelling provides terrific opportunities for studying story components and literature.",
