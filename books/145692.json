  "description": "Master acupuncturist Dianne Connelly has written a paean to healthy living. But the book is less about health than about wisdom. With her own definitions and explications of essential words to live by, with poetry such as filled her previous book, ALL SICKNESS IS HOME SICKNESS, and with personal stories from her own life and the lives of those she has treated, Dianne points the way to a life of spirit and courage. ~ Guy Hollyday, Environmentalist and acupuncturist",
