By all appearances, Tim had the perfect body and ideal life, but when a not-so-accidental collision brings them together, Ben discovers that the truth is rarely so simple. If winning Tim's heart was an impossible quest, keeping it would prove even harder as family, society, and emotion threaten to tear them apart.

This adaptation is the perfect starting point for newcomers, while those familiar with the novels and movie will discover fresh twists and turns.
