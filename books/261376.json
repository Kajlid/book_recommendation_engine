  "description": "With Song of Napalm, Bruce Weigl established himself as a poet of incomparable power and lyric fury whose work stands as an elegy to the countless lives dramatically altered by war. Archeology of the Circle brings together the major work of one of America's greatest poets. Collected here for the first time, from eight volumes of poetry and spanning two decades, the poems in Archeology of the Circle also include Bruce Weigl's most recent work, which takes a dramatic turn toward a hard-bitten and sensuous lyric. Out of the horror of individual experience, Bruce Weigl has fashioned poetry that offers solace to disillusionment and bears transcendent resonance for all of us. Archeology of the Circle illustrates Bruce Weigl's remarkable creative achievements and signifies his own personal and spiritual salvation through his writing.",
