  "description": "Samantha Evans is a dog. It wasn't always this way. In fact, she once was a normal human: a college graduate, former homecoming queen, and the possessor of a six-figure income. But she was in the mood for a change-and she got more than she bargained for (much more) thanks to a gypsy's spell. Daniel O'Brien never needed anyone or anything until he finds a stray dog . . . not just any dog . . . Sam. Sam changes his life by turning it upside down and inside out. Can the unconditional love shared by dog and master lead to true love between a man and a woman?",
