  "description": "William Morris in Iceland: Questions of Travel Lavinia Greenlaw's selection from Morris's Icelandic Journal ('the best book of travel written by an English poet', and the least known) is interposed with her own 'questions of travel', which follow the footprints of Morris's prose, responding to its surfaces and undercurrents, extending its horizons. The result is a new and composite work, which brilliantly explores our conflicted reasons for not staying at home.",
