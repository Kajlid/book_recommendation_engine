  "description": "My new neighbor is a firefighter—and a scorching hot single dad—but I swear I didn’t set off that smoke alarm on purpose.(And I was beyond mortified when he rushed in and saw me naked.)Nothing happened, of course—because I, Winnie MacAllister, romance junkie and owner of a constantly broken heart, have sworn off men for one solid year.Even protective men with chiseled jaws, bulging biceps, and deep brown eyes that make my breath come faster. Even former SEALs with broad chests and strong hands that make my skin sizzle. Even gorgeous, grumpy guys who have their hands full raising two adorable little girls and claim they don’t believe in love.Until Dex kisses me one night, and I drop all my defenses.(Also my underwear.)He says he’s not gentle, and he’s right. He says I should take the dream job I’m offered in another state, and he’s right. He says he’s too old for me and could never be the man I deserve.He’s wrong.Dex and I might be twelve years apart, but the fire between us is the kind that will never burn out.How can I convince him to give happily-ever-after with me a chance?",
