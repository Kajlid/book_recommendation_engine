That’s just the thing though. Jax isn’t a boy. He’s all man. First, I gave him my innocence. Second, I gave him my heart. But when my family finds out about us… I just hope I don’t get him killed.  Jax   She’s the granddaughter of a rival club’s President. She’s barely legal and way too innocent for me. I’m too old. Too hardened by life, but one taste of her and it’s too late. I’ve claimed her as my own. And I’ll die before I let anyone take her away from me. Unfortunately, it might just come to that. Bree says we’re soul mates. Fated for each other. When I’m staring down the barrel of a gun about to lose everything. It seems like fate might have given me the shaft.   A Devil's Blaze MC novel which can be read as part of the series or as a complete stand alone. Don't read if you have Daddy Issues. But if you like hot, steamy older Alpha Male?
