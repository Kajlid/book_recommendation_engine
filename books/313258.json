  "description": "Thirteen-year old Melly is at a loss what to say when at school she is asked to reveal her plans for the summer vacation, so on an impulse she writes \"I am going to teach my horse to live in the house so he can civilize my sisters.\" Melly's horse is Orbit, a glorious palamino stallion who she loves more than anything else in the world. And now she has to wrestle with the problem of how to carry out her impulsive plan and actually get Orbit into the house. However, Melly finds herself with another problem. Her father's architect business isn't doing too well, and it seems there won't be enough money for him to send Melly's older sisters to the prestigious colleges they yearn for. Melly longs for her clever sister Katy to be able to go to the college of her dreams, and she knows someone who will pay her a lot of money for Orbit. But can she bring herself to make the sacrifice? And what will her family say when they find out?",
