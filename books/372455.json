  "description": "This vintage paperback has been read a lot, some good Karma from all that reading. Has heavy tanning from age. 1952 printing of this Korean War malaise story, a great and neglected bit of writing. Our Family carefully packs each book in high-quality bubble lined, envelopes. We appreciate your business and welcome any questions.",
