  "description": "This powerful book places the complex and apparently insoluble problems of South Africa in a new light, and movingly exhibits the great love she and the people she met share for the country. Dervla Murphy has been recording her travel experiences―treks through (among other places) India, Transylvania, and several countries in Africa―for well over thirty years. In South from the Limpopo, she continues her writings on the African continent, bringing her unique insights to the still-troubled country of South Africa.",
