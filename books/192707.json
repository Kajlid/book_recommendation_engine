  "description": "Mysterious, enigmatic Prince Nicholas Savron had the face of a fallen angel, but Silver Delaney knew his devil's beauty was a snare, and she dared not be trapped by it. He understood she'd never yield to him without a struggle, but her hair like dark flame stirred him, her satin skin tempted him irresistibly, and he felt the passion in her reach out and stroke him. Held captive on the riverboat he'd won in a poker game, she was mesmerized by the bold, sensuous sun god who made her tremble, but she refused his demand that she reveal a family secret. She was half Apache, half Delaney, an outcast who treasured loyalty and vowed escape -- even if Nicholas could drive her to the brink of madness with his bold embraces. He dazzled her, wooed his proud warrior woman until she became his quest, his outspoken dream. But once her courage survived a terrifying test, could he make his lovely, wild pagan understand that she was his destiny, the legendary Firebird who would carry him to a heaven that was home in her arms?",
