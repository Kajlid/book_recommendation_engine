  "description": "Locked away in his citadel prison for 300 years, Hafram has stumbled across an ally, the only person who has been able to accept his thoughts through the crude but powerful shield holding him prisoner. Knowing that his opportunities are dwindling and his magics were beginning to fade with age, he realizes he must protect his new charge at all costs. Weaving an intricate spell he gives Aethan a protector, a powerful mountain cat that draws it's life force from his own. His task has begun anew and he vows that the shackles from Darthune shall be thrown from the throne of Euwold as the hunt for the White Staff begins again.",
