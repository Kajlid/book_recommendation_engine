Little does the poor virgin know that Herby can shift into the green and leafy stud of his (wet) dreams.Could there be room for romance? Who knows? But pleasure comes first in what could turn into a unique experience.Too bad Herby doesnâ€™t speak English. Oh, well. He certainly speaks body language, and quite well from what Cochran is about to discover.Author's Note: This book has been removed from bookstores and is no longer available. I apologize for the inconvenience.",
