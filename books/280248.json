  "description": "Pilar's mother has been extra vigilant about her fifteen-year-old daughter's diet after she came home from school in tears. The truth is, Pilar wouldn't mind losing some weight. She dreams of becoming an actor and wants to try out for the school production of \"Our Town,\" but she's reminded constantly that she's too ugly, too fat, too Mexican. With the encouragement of some new friends and her feisty grandmother who thinks she's perfect just the way she is, Pilar works up the nerve to try out for the play in spite of continued harassment by Becca Barlowe and her posse. But when a handsome high school jock plays a mean trick on her that becomes a social media sensation, Pilar once again finds herself using food to anesthetize her pain. This appealing novel for mature teens juxtaposes Pilar's story with her grandmother's when she was married to a male chauvinist years earlier in Laredo, Texas. Both women must struggle to find their own voice in a world where others insist on defining them as \"less than.\" Capturing the heartache of seeking and accepting one s true self, Anna Garcia Schaper movingly explores the strength of family bonds and their importance in overcoming difficult and sometimes tragic circumstances.",
