  "title": "Unveiling Islam: An Insider's Look at Muslim Life and Beliefs",
  "description": "As sons of a Muslim muazzein (Islamic cleric), the Caner brothers have first-hand knowledge of the major beliefs and daily practices of Islamic life. Now Christians, the Caners are in a unique position to present an insider s look at Muslim beliefs. In a sympathetic yet honest presentation, the Caner brothers offer clear explanations of what is and what is not Islamic doctrine and the religion s impact on daily life. Western readers will find this candid presentation extraordinarily helpful. Unveiling Islam covers the entire scope of IslamÂ—its practices, ethics, and beliefs. It explains the Jihad, sects within Islam, and how Islam can be used to justify violence when one of its primary tenets is peace. The final two chapters show how Islam views Christianity and how Christians can open understanding dialogue with Muslims.",
