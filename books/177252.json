  "description": "Loves comes in all shapes and forms, and sometimes it can be hard to distinguish which one you’re given.I run from my pain—that’s just what I do. It’s how I’ve managed to keep a handle on the shame and remorse at what I did the day my life changed. Has it changed me for the good, or for the worse—I can never be sure? Some days it’s one and most it’s the other.Now, each day is getting darker, ever since I met the woman who has the power to ease my ache and got a taste for what could be. Selfish? Maybe. Foolish? Definitely. But nothing can stop me until I prove to her she needs me just as much as it kills me to wake up one more day without her.I’ll do whatever it takes—even if I risk my life and my health fighting her psychotic and possessive old man to get her in my bed.",
