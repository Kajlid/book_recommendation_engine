  "description": "Protect and serve; duties that Sheriff Sharon Downey was always proud to fulfill, even if some of those lines between the two seemed to blur from time to time. She’d grown up in Markham, knew what life was like with an MC in residence, and admittedly, she let their business continue as long as they cleaned up after themselves and kept it all quiet. The only issue of her life that caused dissatisfaction was her loneliness. Being the sheriff did not make for an active and rewarding social life.Mark “Fritter” Horton never looked too hard for a meaningful connection beyond the brothers of the Red Rebels. Happy to have his feminine influences provided solely by his mother, paired with a Southern charm that is warm and genuine, he can bounce from bed to bed and body to body without tangled attachments or hurt feelings. And the further into the criminal underbelly the Red Rebels get, the more important it is that any private encounters with Markham’s sheriff remain secret and impersonal.But time is running out. The longer they are undiscovered, the more heightened their worry over being found out. And with more time spent together, the closer they become to being something permanent as ink.",
