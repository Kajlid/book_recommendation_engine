  "title": "Unapologetic: A Black, Queer, and Feminist Mandate for Radical Movements",
  "description": "A nationally recognized activist's 21st century guide to liberation through a Black queer feminist lens.Appearing on The Roots' annual list, in 2017, as one of the most influential young African Americans, Carruthers--at age 32--is among a handful of high profile activists. Her debut book upends mainstream ideas about race, class and gender and sets forth a radically inclusive path to collective liberation. Her inclusive story about Black struggle draws on Black intellectual and grassroots organizing traditions including the Haitian Revolution, U.S. Civil Rights, and Black and LGBTQ Feminist Movements. Bold and honest, Unapologetic is an inside look from an on-the-ground activist and movement leader about how to move people from the margins to the center of political strategy and practice.",
