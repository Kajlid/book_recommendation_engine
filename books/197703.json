But when an old acquaintance calls needing Daisy’s...expertise...to help catch a cheater, she heads back to Las Vegas and the poker tables.FBI Agent Ryan DiNatto’s been a gambler since he was four, and a hustler since he hit puberty. Coming off an undercover mission that ended with him shot and his partner in a wheelchair, Ryan’s out for blood.
