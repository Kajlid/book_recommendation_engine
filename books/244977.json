  "description": "The humans could live perfectly in peace if it weren't for those pesky gods, always meddling in their business and manipulating fate for their amusement. This time, the victim of their plot is one of the most powerful Amazon rulers alive – Queen Elektra. An embittered wager between Zeus and Hera results in Queen Elektra's banishment to the depth of Hades. When she is sent away, she leaves behind the Golden Girdle - a holder of mysteries and granter of immortality. But that isn't the only thing generated in her absence. Elektra's departure creates a power void that desperately needs to be filled. And thus, two new prospects emerge – Teigra and Thea. Teigra is a lone wolf slave who suffers a life of unspeakable brutality — forced to earn her living as a cage fighter, with only her cunning wit, quick reflexes, and lethal striking ability to protect her. Thea, on the other hand, is training as a Sondra — an elite Amazonian warrior whose mission is to eliminate any outside threat. In this cruel and bloody journey set in an ancient world of slavery, torture, and clashing kingdoms, our fated warriors fight for survival and battle to uphold their core beliefs. On opposite sides of a grand, savage conflict, each woman is driven to dominate the other by a shared prophecy and an instinctual, internal force to outlive and outlast. Who will be the victor? Who will rise to fill the vacuum formed by Queen Elektra's disappearance? Who will be the bearer of the Golden Girdle? Follow the story of Teigra's and Thea's intertwined fates, and find out.
