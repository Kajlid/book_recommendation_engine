  "description": "Robert Bedick's new collection of nine short stories, An Argument In Favor Of Television and Other Stories, reaffirms everything we learned about him from his well-regarded first novel, Tomas. That is, he is a writer who knows how to write. From Microwave, A Love Story (On Twitter) - a story that originally appeared in installments on Twitter - to The Eden Project - a story where two twenty-somethings attempt to re-create the Garden of Eden on a Twister mat within their Brooklyn apartment, Bedick shows that he knows how to bend all the usual rules to create a style and voice that are all his own. But he also proves with stories such as One Dead Grandfather and Limousines and Violins, that he knows how to use the classic elements of plot, character, and dialogue to create stories that will grab your heart. An Argument In Favor Of Television: A writer finds it difficult to keep autobiography and fiction separate.The Loneliest Monk: A cross country trek where one of the travelers may or may not exist.The Receptionist: What happens in the age of budget cuts when an English Ph.D. becomes a receptionist.A Second Chance: Do I know you? If I don’t, I will.The Eden Project: Two twenty-somethings create The Garden of Eden in a Brooklyn apartment using a Twister mat.Microwave, A Love Story (On Twitter): An obsession with microwaves can lead to only one thing – love.Daughters: A story where the roles of mother and daughter keep switching.One Dead Grandfather: A teenager regrets he wasn’t present for his grandfather’s final moments.Limousines and Violins: If your father had a brother who died before you were born, did you ever have an uncle?",
