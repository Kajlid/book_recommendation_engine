  "description": "WARNING: Single HOT biker dad alert!SANDY – Grayson “Smokey” Wallace was a biker who was handsome, intelligent, ridiculously sexy, and a single dad.  His swagger alone melted me into a puddle the night we met. There was only one problem, he didn’t do relationships.  Knowing that tidbit of information beforehand was nice. It allowed me to get what I wanted from him and go on my merry way.  My plan, however didn’t work.  Not. At. All.  SMOKEY – The night I met Sandy I was after one thing and one thing only. Sex.  There’s only one member of the opposite sex who I’ve ever cared about - my daughter. And, I knew that would never change.  Or so I thought.  Walking away isn’t always as easy as one might think. RIGID is a stand-alone erotic romance with NO CHEATING, no sex outside the relationship, no cliffhanger, and it has the happiest of HEAs. The hero is Hot single father and the heroine is not a doormat. Yes, you will enjoy this book. No, you will not get any sleep. Yes, you must have a free hand to read this novel. No, you do not need to read any other books to understand this one fully.  WARNING: This novel will set your Kindle ablaze. It is a certified one-handed read.",
