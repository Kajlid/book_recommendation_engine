  "description": "Amanda Beth Luker has always wanted more than life in her trailer park town. She has no degree, and no plan, but when she meets Tom Davis, a powerful lawyer with aspirations of making a difference, she knows her only chance for success is to do whatever it takes, whatever he asks of her—even as it threatens the one person she has ever let herself love, the smoldering and troubled Pax Westerbrook. She suspects one man will make her and one will destroy her—but can she figure out which in time?",
