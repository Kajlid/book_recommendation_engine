  "description": "Much like Lin-Manuel Miranda did in Hamilton, the New York Times best-selling author David Elliott turns a classic on its head in form and approach, updating the timeless story of Theseus and the Minotaur. A rough, rowdy, and darkly comedic young adult retelling in verse, which NPR called \"beautifully clever,\" Bull will have readers reevaluating one of mythology's most infamous monsters.SEE THE STORY OF THESEUS AND THE MINOTAUR  IN A WHOLE NEW LIGHTMinos thought he could  Pull a fast one  On me,  Poseidon!  God of the Sea!  But I'm the last one  On whom you  Should try such a thing.  The nerve of that guy.  The balls. The audacity.  I AM THE OCEAN!  I got capacity!  Depths! Darkness! Delphic power!  So his sweet little plan  Went big-time sour  And his wife had a son  Born with horns and a muzzle  Who ended up  In an underground puzzle.  What is it with you mortals?  You just can't seem to  If you play with fire, babies,  You're gonna get burned.",
