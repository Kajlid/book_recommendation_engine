  "description": "Elizabeth A. Lynn won the World Fantasy Award for Watchtower, volume one in a breathtaking trilogy that would establish her as one of speculative fiction's most exciting voices. Now, Ace brings this classic back to fans and first-time readers alike--in a beautifully repackaged trade paperback edition. Tornor Keep is the legendary tower that guards the winter end of a summer land. But when Tornor is overrun by raiders, a young prince is the tower's last hope in an enchanting story of a time far removed from ours and of a land alive with warriors, lovers, war, and honor.",
