  "description": "Inundated by popular culture, many women have lost their bearings and no longer trust the internal compass that intuitively affirms those things that are good, true, and noble about womanhood. And as Jesus' favorite and most powerful teaching tactic was the parable, it is appropriate that Mary Kassian walks the reader through the compelling tale of the wild versus wise woman found in Proverbs 7. By using 20 points of contrast, the reader will be able to discern the difference between wild and wise. Is she living as a wise, biblically savy woman' Or has she bought into the one our culture holds as ideal: the wild woman'Girls Gone Wise in a World Gone Wild will captivate, convict, and challenge women to become decreasingly wild and increasingly wise. Includes questions for personal reflection at the end of each chapter.",
