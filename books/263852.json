She has also cross-registered for a physics class over at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), two stops away from Harvard...Alan Jenson, a professor of chemistry and physics at MIT, is looking for love. When Elisa Maple registers for his course, “The Physics of Chemistry,” the two experience instant attraction. And when Elisa goes to his office hours, their chemistry only grows stronger. Can they find a way to make their romance work? A short and sweet––and rather naughty––tale set in the lovely university town of Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
