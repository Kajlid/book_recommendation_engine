  "description": "In trouble. Need to talk to you. Urgent. Cambry Sinclair is rattled by the cryptic message from her scientist father. It s been years since she last saw the man, and despite his recent attempts at contact, she has no interest in reconnecting. But something about this late-night message urges her to act... Arriving at her father s office, she s horrified to discover him lying in a pool of blood, barely clinging to life. Someone clearly wants him dead but why? With a shaky alibi and evidence mounting against her, Cambry becomes the prime suspect. Now, only one man can help prove her FBI agent Ethan Reece, the man sent to track down her father s dangerous research and the man who broke her heart years before. Ethan hesitantly returns to the town saturated in painful history, and his assignment to investigate his former flame doesn t make his life any more comfortable. As the uneasy duo begin to work together, uncovering the potentially catastrophic application of her father s research, it becomes clear that the real murderer has far more diabolical plans than they could have dreamed. Shocking secrets and devastating betrayals threaten Cambry and Ethan s tentative new relationship, and the clock is ticking as they fight to expose the real killer before Cambry becomes the next victim in someone s terrifying plot.",
