  "description": "In World War II, the allied invasion of the continent hinges on keeping one secret absolutely secure. No one must find out, or all hope is lost.  Tonight, German spy Konrad Achterberg is about to discover what that secret is.  He's also about to find out that the Nazis aren't the scariest predators in the night. Because something in the dark is colder than the dark. And it is hungry.  [Until release, this is still free with signing up for the Declan Finn mailing list, available through his blog at www.declanfinn.com]",
