  "description": "Playing for a Piece of the A History of Garage and Frat Bands in Memphis 1960-75 is a candid history and discography of over one hundred bands who recorded at least one record in Memphis from 1960-75. From nationally charting groups like the Box Tops, Sam the Sham and the Pharoahs, the Gentrys and the Hombres to long-forgotten high school rockers who cut a record, had their fifteen minutes of fame, and then faded away, every Memphis garage band is included. Includes many unpublished photos as well as a complete listing of all band members and discographies of each band. Though countless books have been written about Memphis Music--including Elvis, Stax, and the blues, this genre of Memphis music has never been exhaustively touched upon until now.",
