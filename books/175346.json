She’s come here to reinvent herself after twenty years of marriage and two grown children. Until the night Richard uttered those “I’m leaving you Sara. I don’t want to be married anymore. I’ve filed for divorce,” she never dreamed this could happen to her. She’s escaped to the Jersey Shore for a time-out, never expecting what she’d find.She doesn’t expect to fall in love with a ghost, or find a colony of time travellers reincarnated from the Civil War, become dangerously embroiled in a tax-evasion scheme with a fake foundation, or be sent back to a whaling village in the 1860s to solve a mystery with present day consequences, where she meets her ghost and realizes he is the one man destined to be the true love of her life.
