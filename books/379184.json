  "description": "Denise, a middle-aged idealist, cashes her last $400 paycheck and drives south with her two Chihuahuas in search of a summer job that will renew her weary spirit. As she drives through a national park in Northern California, Denise stumbles upon a job as a fast-fry cook at Hacienda RV Park and seizes the promising opportunity. Unfortunately, her job behind the grill turns out to be more complicated than flipping burgers and transforms her working vacation into a trip comparable to the psych ward. As she falls deeper into the tangled web created by her dysfunctional, dangerous, and inept coworkers, Denise struggles to make this working vacation a positive time in her life and, at the least, come out of it alive. Reading GRILL! takes you to a place you never want to go; and a job that no one should ever have to endure. At the same time, there will be those of you who will completely identify with Denise, the place, and the job; those who have also been grilled to a crisp in a whacked-out environment. About the Diane Stegman has been an artist throughout most of her life and spends her free time painting or writing. She owned and operated a custom picture framing shop in Carmel Valley for thirteen years and currently resides in the high desert of southern California with her parents, tending to their daily needs and health concerns. Diane is the proud mother of two grown sons and grandmother of four grandchildren. This is her first published book.",
