  "description": "Among Lenin's most significant theoretical works, What ls To Be Done? has long been a classic on the role of a revolutionary socialist party. In it he elaborated the principles upon which the Bolshevik, or Communist, Party was founded. Lenin clarified the difference between a party of reform and a vanguard party of revolution and the role of Marxist theory and education. He discussed questions such as the attitude to terrorism, to reforms and to students and other non--proletarian forces, as well as methods of work, the party press and assimilation of the experiences of other countries.",
