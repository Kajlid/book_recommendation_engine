  "description": "Roxanne Bloom is through with love. Fresh on the heels of a bad break-up, she’s decided to devote all her time to her man-slamming website—and her man-hating dog, Lilith. But this pit-bull-Boxer is so good at unleashing her fury (and her owner’s) that the male victims keep piling up…and now it’s time to get some sensitivity training.

But she’s not putting her guard down just yet—even if she is falling deeply, madly, doggedly in love with him...",
