  "description": "When Gillian, the mother of two girls, disappears, she casts each of her daughters upon their own quite separate quests for survival, solace, and redemption. In the wake of her abandonment, the girls find their mother's absence as potent as her presence. While Missy aches for her mother's love, she holds the truth of that love's denial like a smooth, cold stone. Ruby, a few years younger, does not remember their mother and wants her back, no matter the cost. In From Bruised Fell, with lyricism and emotional truth, Finlay-Young details brilliantly a sibling relationship in all its intimacy and complexity, while exploring our capacity to live with and beyond a troubled past.",
