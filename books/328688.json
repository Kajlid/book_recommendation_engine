  "title": "ALEC: The Years Have Pants (A Life-Size Omnibus) - Hardcover Edition",
  "description": "For the first time ever, the pioneering autobiographical comics of master cartoonist Eddie Campbell (From Hell) are collected in a single volume! Brilliantly observed and profoundly expressed, the ALEC stories present a version of Campbell's own life, filtered through the alter ego of \"Alec MacGarry.\" Over many years, we witness Alec's (and Eddie's) progression \"from beer to wine\" - wild nights at the pub, existential despair, the hunt for love, the quest for art, becoming a \"responsible breadwinner,\" feeling lost at his own movie premiere, and much more! Eddie's outlandish fantasies and metafictional tricks convert life into art, while staying fully grounded in his own absurdity. This Life-Size Omnibus edition of ALEC includes all the stories from The King Canute Crowd, Three-Piece Suit, How to be an Artist, and After the Snooter, as well as the very early, out-of-print ALEC stories and a staggering amount of bonus material.",
