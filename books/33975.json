  "description": "There are times when a picture doesn't just say it all - it changes everything.Isabel Sterling isn't even aware she has been entered in the Sophisticated Women 'Watch Your Dreams Come True' contest, so it comes as a complete surprise to learn she has won not only a makeover she doesn't want or need, but also the chance to appear on the cover of a national magazine and an all expense paid trip for two to exotic locales. Photographer Natasha Kashnikova is a cynical celebrity playgirl who is barreling toward full, midlife-crisis mode when she agrees to take on the Sophisticated Women shoot as a favor for a friend. Kash is convinced that every woman who shows an interest in her has ulterior motives, so love is not on her agendaâ€”and certainly not with some naive romantic during an assignment from Hell.",
