  "description": "A re-imagining of the classic fairy tale The Frog Princess.  Henrietta cherished her uncomplicated life - until the day she discovered an ogre living in the forest.  Lady Henrietta Pemberly could think of nothing more depressing than being wooed for her inheritance. In fact, if a dragon-slaying knight in shining armour wasn’t to be then she was quite content to skip merrily towards spinsterhood. Unfortunately, her interfering sister Prudence had other plans and before Henrietta could say ‘what bloody tournament?’ she is being paraded before a bevy of armour clad knights as the tourney prize.  When the handsome and charming Sir Hardwick wins the right to court her Henrietta should be delighted. After all, other than the lack of dragon-slaying skills, he is everything her girlish dreams had ever conjured. So why then, when faced with the prospect of marriage to her captivating suitor does she instead seek the company of the surly ogre?  Enchanting Tales is a series of fairy tale re-tellings with a Regency setting. The stories are all set in the same world but each book can be read as a stand-alone. So, if you enjoy your fairy tales with a twist on the originals, a dash of humour thrown in but without any naughty bits then download Enchanting Tales today and lose yourself in a world of sweet romance.",
