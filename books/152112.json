  "description": "Amelia Mason had always believed in happy endings—until her own crashed and burned. Unable to deal with the loss, she'd packed up and left Detroit, her family, and the only home she'd ever known. Now, seven years later, she's forced to return, since her sister and niece have vanished without a trace, and she'll do anything to find them. Even if it means dealing with the last person she wants to see, the person responsible for her crushed dreams—her ex-husband. Danny Benson was Nightshade through and through. There was nothing he wouldn't do for his club, and he'd proven it time and time again. The only regret he had was not being able to hold on to his wife. Now she's back, alone and scared, and there's nothing he won't do to get her back. Even if helping her leads to him question the very people he'd sacrificed so much for. He'll do what it takes to make it right. As the search for the missing mother and child intensifies, secrets better left buried are brought to light, and those secrets threaten to tear everything apart.",
