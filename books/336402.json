  "description": "They're bikers. They're brothers.They're shifters, well, most of them... Kisy is on the run... not from the law, but from her boss's \"assistants.\" After witnessing something she shouldn't have, she thought it best to not stick around for them to do the same to her. Ten days in, they track her down at a restaurant. In an attempt to get away, she runs into a stranger. Literally runs into him. Knowing she doesn't have time to complete her escape, she drops to her knees and pretends to be examining his jeans. Dragon is all too happy to help the pretty stranger on her knees in front of him, but when he realizes she's on the run from the two men that he's trailing, he finds himself in the position of needing to help yet another woman get away from the same horrible man. Not that helping her is in any way a hardship. When he tries to help her, Kisy steals his bike. As an enforcer for the Howlers MC, his brothers would never let him forget it if he didn't find his bike and the bewitching woman who stole it. When he tracks her down at a gas station, his wolf demands they keep her and Dragon agrees. Kisy thinks she's just going to a safe place until her boss and his crew are handled, but she can't help but be drawn to the man who demanded she get on his bike. The Howlers are in the middle of a war with another club and more gets piled on with each passing day, but they're used to trouble, drama, and saving women from men that never deserved them in the first place. With the help of the gods' champions and their allies, will they be able to fend off disaster? When Kisy's boss is gone and the Howlers take care of their enemies, will Kisy stay? Will Dragon let her go? Where will the Howlers go from here?18 and up **check author's website for tropes, tags, and anything concerning CWs**",
