  "title": "Polar Dream: The First Solo Expedition by a Woman and Her Dog to the Magnetic North Pole",
  "description": "In 1988, at the age of 50, Helen Thayer became the first woman in the world to travel on foot to the magnetic North Pole, one of the world's most remote and dangerous regions. Her only companion was Charlie, her loyal husky, who was integral to her survival. Polar Dream is the story of their heroic trek and extraordinary relationship as they faced polar bears, unimaginable cold, and a storm that destroyed most of their supplies and food. A new epilogue, maps, and many previously unpublished expedition photographs are new to this second edition. \"A page-turner.... Fully captures the drama of what was a remarkable achievement.\" â€” The Washington Times",
