  "description": "Logan Jax is the boss who plans to charm the off-limits nanny…I probably shouldn’t have eyed the nanny like she was my next meal. But what guy living a bachelor’s life wouldn’t when your nanny looks like Sadie? I don’t get points for asking her to be my fake date, either. But I needed to close a billion-dollar deal. I definitely don’t get points for sleeping with the nanny. However, Sadie’s hand roamed, my hand roamed, and the rest is history.My sister gave me one rule when my nephew was placed in my care. Don’t (literally!) screw up the arrangement with the supernanny.And despite the sexy nanny trying to keep it professional, my charm wore her down, and although Sadie struts around in my shirt, clearly enjoying my cocky antics—it’s a problem. I’m positive she wants me, and I want her. But I don’t do relationships or family; I’m not the settling-down type, and that’s exactly what she wants…The Big Charmer is the second standalone novel from the Mr. Boss series where you can revisit your favorite characters throughout. This feel-good story is filled with banter, a swoony boss, steamy times, and surprises along the way.",
