  "title": "The Inimitable Jeeves",
  "description": "In a series of brilliantly plotted episodes, Bertie and Jeeves help Bingo Little with his love-life, as Bingo is involved successively with tea-shop waitress, Mabel; Honoria Glossop (whose laugh sounds like a train going through a tunnel); gold-toothed revolutionary, Charlotte Corday Rowbotham; earl's daughter, Cynthia; vicar's niece, Mary; and Rosie M. Banks, romantic novelist.While solving these problems, Jeeves also manages to retrieve Aunt Agatha's pearls, keep Cyril Bassington-Bassington off the Broadway stage, fix the Girls' Egg-and-Spoon race, handle the irrepressible Claude and Eustace, and disentangle Bertie's own relationship with the fearsome Honoria. A full comic schedule, then.",
