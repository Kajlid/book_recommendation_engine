  "description": "Life at Crazy Hills has become crazier, and the cowboys are misbehaving. Their worlds are turned upside down as lust leads them to places they never thought they would go.For Erick McTavish, meeting the handsome young cowboy, Sterling White, is the first sign he may be able to put the pain and the flashbacks from his brutal abduction behind him for good. Too bad Sterling doesn’t seem to return those feelings.Determined to remain straight, Sterling hates the walking, talking temptation that is Erick, yet he can’t seem to stop his desire to experience his first kiss with a man, but not just any man, only Erick will do. The tattered remains of Sterling’s denial are stripped away when fate steps in and wickedly hot passion ignites between the pair, leaving Sterling unable to imagine a life without Erick.Meanwhile, the bonds of friendship between Gresh, Connor, Lane, and Riley are tested when dark desire leads them down a dangerous path twisting their relationship to the max, leaving all four men wondering if any relationship is possible after betrayal.",
