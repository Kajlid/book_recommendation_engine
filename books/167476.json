  "description": "Elise Kavanagh has been hired to exorcise a castle in Ireland. Easy job. But her partner, James Faulkner, thinks they aren't dealing with a demon -- and if he's right, then what they're facing is far rarer and more dangerous than anything they've fought before...  This is a 14,000 word short story (about the length of 3-4 chapters in my novels) that takes place before the events of The Descent Series.",
