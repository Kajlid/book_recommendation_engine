  "description": "As escalating aggression and chaotic global changes converge, threatening to crush our dreams and collapse the foundation of reality is a perceptual shift or evolution of consciousness emerging to unveil knowledge of the absolute truth of humanity's destiny. Stemming from authentic science, The Chrysopoeia Revelation unfolds an answer that includes how humanity will evolve higher consciousness and mortal being. At the site of an anomalous Mayan Pyramid in Panama, Ben, a professor researching the field of consciousness, joins an expedition in quest for an ancient relic that reveals how to accelerate the evolution of higher consciousness. The dangers Ben faces, dimensional experiences, a romantic past-life back-story, and the choices he makes raises his super-conscious abilities. Pursued by guerilla mercenaries working for the Illuminati's New World Order, the expedition-which includes a Mayan Shaman and yet-to-be-realized soul mates-discovers the secret to evolving humanity in accord with the Mayan 2012 prophesy of a new age of peace, prosperity, and spirituality. Praise for The Chrysopoeia There is some great stuff here-vision quests, reincarnation, slow time. As a writer, you have come up with an amazing concept. The vision scenes hold the key to additional tension and action. As written, these are immensely powerful mental and visual sequences. -Script Pipeline, Hollywood, Ca.",
