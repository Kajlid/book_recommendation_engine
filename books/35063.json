  "description": "In the Second World War, four Resistance fighters are executed by the Gestapo in France's Occupied Southern Zone. More than fifty years later a wealthy German family, resident in Provence, is brutally murdered. When a local gardener is arrested and charged, Daniel Jacquot of the Cavaillon Regional Crime Squad is convinced they have the wrong man. Four hundred miles away, in Alsace, Marie-Ange Buhl knows it for certain. Marie-Ange is a psychic and has 'helped' the police before. She comes to Provence and begins to investigate with Jacquot, and together they uncover a secret that goes back more than half a century, a story of love and betrayal, hatred and blackmail in which his own family had a tragic part to play.",
