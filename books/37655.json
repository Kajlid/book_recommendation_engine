  "description": "Accomplished comic artist Barbara Slate--who has been called \"titanically talented\" by Stan Lee and her work \"emphatically of our time\" by the New York Times-- lets it all out in a savagely funny and emotionally honest fictional narrative, told in a series of hilarious panels.  After having been a good girl and following her mother’s advice to snag a husband before she became a twenty-something spinster, Barbara Slate realized that her Mr. Right was actually Mr. Wrong and that she was living her life according to everyone’s rules but her own. After twelve years of an unblissful marriage, she made her escape.   Now this accomplished comic artist lets it all out in a savagely funny and emotionally honest fictional narrative. Jo, her stand-in protagonist, is a successful wedding photographer (of all things) who has been dumped by her husband and desperately needs to get on with her life. She follows her friends’ advice to get laid, see a shrink, go out more, and live a little. Nothing works. Eventually she realizes that she must stop listening to what everybody else tells her and follow her own voice instead.   Jo’s struggle with female guilt and her quest for self-awareness, told in a series of hilarious panels, is the perfect book for any woman needing to take back control of her life, or remembering when she did.\"A must-read for any woman who has ever been cheated on, owned a Barbie, or once believed their mother's version of ‘happily ever after’. Skip the pity party and buy this book!” —Josie Brown, author, Secret Lives of Husbands and Wives and The Housewife Assassin's Handbook",
