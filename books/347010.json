  "title": "A Fine Cure from Fennel Seed",
  "description": "It's 1932 in Greenwich Village, Spencer the druggist thinks his artist friend Leo has a problem with his health that could be cured through the proper use of fennel. Leo thinks Spencer has a reserve about his inclinations that could be cured through some confidences shared with Leo. Given enough time and privacy, the friends might be able to talk through their confusion. Perhaps it's just as well that, between the relatives, the neighbors, the determined drunk, the burlesque dancer, and the five rogue puppies, there won't be much time for talking. Instead, Spencer and Leo will have to find a blunter, warmer way to determine exactly what can be cured with fennel.",
