  "description": "Chad King is boxing’s golden boy that didn’t shine.  His big dreams have left him at rock bottom and when you’ve lost everything, losing becomes easy because there’s nothing to fight for. The love of his life left him for a life he couldn’t give her and now she’s engaged and on top of the world while he claws his way out of the hole he dug when she left.  Lotus Shaw plays the role of the media’s darling, and dutiful fiancé to a man only her parents approve of. She should be on top of the world, but she left her heart on the floor of a fight gym.  Now, she’s got to get it back.  One little secret from the past is keeping her from the future.  When they come face to face again, nothing could’ve prepared them for the sucker punch love was about to land. Nothing worth having comes without a fight.",
