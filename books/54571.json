  "description": "In an underground club, a high-ranking public official spends his secret nights indulging in fantasies as exciting as they are depraved. For a seductive employee of the Dungeon, it's her job to fulfill them. But she's playing a far more dangerous game-one of blackmail, politics, and murder that reaches into the shadow world of the GhostWalkers, and the creation of a spectacular, one-of-a-kind new weapon of defense. But when a dictator makes his own catastrophic moves, the GhostWalkers have no choice but to bring in two major players-a man and woman both driven by passion and revenge. Both expendable. Both with nothing left to lose.",
