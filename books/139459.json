  "description": "Late twelfth-century England: a country of divided loyalties while the Lionheart is on crusade. Hugh de Barham, master mason at Wells, walks a dangerous path between Glastonbury and Wells as the two vie for supremacy, a path made more dangerous still by the fact that Hugh, if he could, would share his bed not with women but with men.The only way to stay safe is to keep his head down, but building the church of his dreams is no way to do that: and then there is Arnaut lâ€™Occitan. What does this stranger from Provence want with Hugh? And can he, or anyone, be trusted?98000 words",
