Each chapter is illustrated with the latest, breathtaking astrophotography.This companion is broken down into three parts: \"Equipment for Backyard Astronomy\", \"Observing the Celestial Panorama\" and \"Astrophotography\". It focuses on the practical aspects of astronomy.Among many astronomy subjects, the authors offer advice on how to contend with light pollution, and how to take successful and impressive color photographs of galaxies and nebulas (with or without a telescope). Each chapter is written in clear, jargon-free yet detailed.",
