  "description": "While everyone else headed off to college, small town girl, Autumn Malone, stays behind to help manage her family's failing restaurant. Two years later when a scholarship at Adelphi University comes her way, she can't resist the chance to start a new life. The one thing that she isn't planning on...is falling for irresistible Vinny Mazzola. To outsiders, Hamptons born Vinny Mazzola has it all: good looks, money, and an esteemed reputation. While studying business at Adelphi, the last thing he expects to do is fall in love with awkward Autumn Malone who forces him to ask himself what's really important in life. When the opportunity arises for Autumn to work at Vinny's family-owned Italian restaurant, Mazzolas, it seems like a perfect way for her to get to know him better. That is until she meets his over protective mother and his conceited ex-girlfriend who both want nothing more than to get rid of her. Between frats, family, friends, and foes, when it comes down to business, will Vinny and Autumn have to sacrifice everything for a love they can't live without?",
