  "title": "Mississippi Spice: Jordan and Ginger's Story",
  "description": "You fell in love with him in The Sweet Spot and begged for his own happy ending after Ani broke his heart. Jordan Winthrop is back in Book III of The Boston Harbor Romance Series with his own love story. Ginger is everything he’s never been able to resist in a woman. She’s young, heart-wrenchingly beautiful and headstrong, with a vulnerability in her eyes that wrecks him. A fifteen-year age gap and a mysterious past didn’t work for Jordan the first time, but when Ginger shows up on his doorstep in a polka trench coat and red stilettos, his resolve to stay away crumbles.  Warning: This book contains smoldering hot sex scenes between a gorgeous pediatric neurosurgeon and a sassy southern girl from the Mississippi Delta, plenty of humor, a little heartbreak and the happily ever after for Jordan that all his fans have been waiting for!",
