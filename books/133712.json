But the lights are still there.Drifting out of the stars, the people of Atlanta, Texas are eager to sit on their porches and take in the sight of this “once in a lifetime” event.Even when they crash their cars, they watch. Even when they’ve been standing outside all night, they watch.And unbeknownst to those below, the lights are watching too.Borealis is a brand-new tale of cosmic horror from Wile E. Young, the award-winning author of the The Magpie Coffin and Dust Bowl Children.",
