  "description": "Brig Monroe is a brainy security specialist with unique paranormal abilities—a geek with muscles. When it comes to the up-close-and-personal, Brig likes sex as much as the next guy, but she doesn’t do emotion, she’s amused by people who believe in true love. Duncan Cameron is a purebred Scottish prince, and sovereign ruler of the rim planet, Ben Nevis II. The media likes to portray him as a playboy. The assassins on his trail call him the target.When Brig is hired to fortify Cameron’s defenses, her perspective on life is put to test the instant she meets the dazzling prince. The last thing she needs is the distraction of white-hot lust when one-step in the wrong direction could mean death for both of them.",
