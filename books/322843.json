  "description": "All I wanted was a dreamy, winter wonderland to myself...It was supposed to be an escape from the stress back home. A Christmas spent by myself, snowed in somewhere in the middle of nowhere. What I got instead was an unexpected roommate and a chance at my dream job.It should have been easy to keep my distance and focus on the task at hand, but when it came to Luke, nothing was easy. His charm and sexy smile had me wanting to unwrap him as my gift under the tree. Which is why I couldn’t say no when he asked for my help with his sister’s last-minute wedding. The catch- I had to pretend to be his girlfriend AND a caterer.Being a chef at an upscale restaurant was easy. It was the heat in his kitchen that I wasn’t sure I could handle.",
