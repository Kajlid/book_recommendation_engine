  "title": "Women and Politeness: The Hybrid Language and Culture of Chinese Indonesian Women in Surabaya",
  "description": "This book is an account of two generations of Chinese Indonesian women in their language behavior of politeness seen from their educational and cultural backgrounds. They were born and have been living in Indonesia, yet each would carry with her the unique blend of her Chinese, Indonesian, Dutch, and Western cultures. As women, they often bear an important role of generating and mediating their cultures to the next generation. Yet their presence is often silenced and neglected. The data that have been collected, presented and discussed here have been a unique contribution to an ethnographic socio-cultural-linguistic study of female language. Compared to the previous ethnographic studies conducted on Javanese or Indonesian language studies by non Indonesians, this study has taken a different perspective in which the writer, being a Chinese Indonesian woman herself like the participants' background, allowed her as a participant observer, to put herself inside them. This study can therefore be an insider account of their language behaviors, in particular their politeness behaviors.",
