  "description": "Suddenly, there were black clouds in the sky. Everyone heard a loud noise coming from the sky and they all knew that Vorltrarr the Dragon was coming. King Aurthorr yelled out, \"Daughters, Vorltrarr comes! Get ready your weapons! The time has come for you to fulfill the prophecy!\" Princess Sasha, Princess Trina, Princess Alexandra and Rebecca walked up ahead of the army and lined up together in a row. They looked like warriors! Rebecca was not afraid! She took a deep breath and got her weapon ready for the task that lay ahead. She understood the prophecy now and had faith in herself and the Princesses. She was determined not to let them or the Land of Antigua down. They each pulled out their bows and prepared to kill the dragon. The Dragon Vorltrarr got nearer to the heroes! Fire came out of his nostrils and his mouth. Princess Alexandra handed each of the other girls one of the special arrows that they had gotten from the Head Centaur of the Unicorns. All four of the girls pointed their bows up into the air and waited for Vorltrarr to come nearer. Vorltrarr let out such a loud noise that the ground shook! Then fire came right out of his nostrils. The Wizard Thandorfur held his mighty wand up toward the sky and yelled, \"Mighty clouds of the sky, I call upon you to bring forth lightening to destroy the Dragon Vorltrarr!\" Suddenly the black clouds over the Dragon Vorltrarr began to roar like a freight train. Large lightening bolts came out of the clouds toward Vorltrarr. One lightening bolt struck Vorltrarr and wounded him but it didn't kill him!",
