  "title": "Sunset 4",
  "description": "In 1962 the quiet, and seemingly innocent, activities at the Humboldt Motel in this small West Tennessee town went unnoticed and unchallenged. Besides, a little booze, a little gambling and maybe an occasional 'lady of the evening' never hurt anyone, right? Then one fall night after a football game, things began to come apart. It seemed that everything was not how it should be, or at least, how it appeared. Unfaithful housewives, a football coach fixing game scores, a crooked private detective and eventually a murder, would bring exposure to SUnset 4. And that was something its operators didn't want. Carson isn't involved in the investigation, but it seems everyone thinks he is. Protecting a friend, he tries hard to ignore things that are simply not right. Finally, he follows instinct and tackles the innocent and the guilty in SUnset 4.",
