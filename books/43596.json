  "description": "A crime-thriller with an injection of horror.The facts behind the fiction.In 2001 scientists isolated the gene for regenerating damaged organs from the DNA of a South American flatworm. Within five years it had been spliced into the chromosomes of a rhesus monkey, transported through the cell walls by a retro-virus denuded of its own genetic material.Attempting to regrow impaired or elderly tissues, a scientist will one day modify the DNA of human beings by injecting the gene-carrying virus. It is just a matter of time.Before consenting to treatment, you may want to ask a simple question: could there be a situation in which you would want to die but were unable to do so?Journalist Hendrix 'Aitch' Harrison links bodies stolen from a renowned forensic-research lab to an influential drug company.Aided by Sarah Wallace, a determined and beguiling entomologist, he delves into a grisly world of clinical trials and a viral treatment beyond imagining.But Aitch must battle more than his fear of technology to expose the macabre fate of the drugged victims donated to scientific research.",
