  "description": "Jay's StoryWe run from our pasts. We fight against them and refuse to allow them control over us. But our futures and pasts are one of the same, our beliefs moulded from what we are taught and our decisions based on our life's choices as we grow. However, our desires are fed by what we experience through life. The hatred we witness as a child seeps into our souls and nurtures something inside us that can't be denied. And I didn't want to deny it. No matter how much it sickened me. Until her. Until the very thought of hurting Beatrice repulsed me. Yet, the anger and the need grew inside me until i couldn't control the desire. And I destroyed us both. This book contains scenes of intense BDSM, group sex, violence and strong language.",
