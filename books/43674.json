  "description": "Pallas is a friendless teen from a backwater village on a forgotten shore. She really doesn't believe in the gods except to peevishly blame them for drowning her mother. But she's forced to shelve her moody cynicism when she accidentally rescues an obnoxious cat. Suddenly caught in a celestial war, Pallas must do the unthinkable - champion the very goddess she hates. Masquerading as a mythic princess, she convinces everyone she's a child of Atlantis. Yet nothing can save her from certain doom, when the Volcano god reaches out to slay her. For how can a mortal fight a god?",
