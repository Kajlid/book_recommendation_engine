  "description": "Shifters live in the shadows of Seattle, just under the skin of the alpha male, dot-com entrepreneurs who are building a new Silicon Valley in the Emerald City. Jak enjoys the female human population of Seattle as much as any wolf, but his heart belongs to a female shifter who’s already mated. Worse, she’s the mate of his alpha’s brother. Arianna was captured from her pack when she was only twenty and mated to a wolf whose dark side takes full advantage of her unbreakable bond to him. Her nights belong to him, but her days are free to explore other things… including feelings for a wolf she can never have. Is love stronger than magic? Or will breaking an unbreakable bond destroy them both? Torment (Dark Alpha 1) is 60 pages or 15,000 words. It's the first of six episodes in the Dark Alpha serial. Adult content. Ages 18+.",
