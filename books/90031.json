  "title": "Lawrence and the Machine",
  "description": "When a vacancy appears in a house of university intellectuals in picturesque York, Massachusetts, graduate student Lawrence Cassidy jumps at the chance to rent. Soon, though, the disorienting dynamics of the house and its quirky inhabitants insidiously and irrevocably change the course of his life. Practical, conservative Lawrence's moral foundation begins to crack as he is quickly swept into the fold of eccentric scholars that challenges the core of his fundamental values. Eventually, the art of debate escalates to radical action, resulting in a brutal crime of social passion that no one can take back, and everything Lawrence once thought he knew is forever revolutionized. A darkly comic tale, Lawrence and the Machine explores how our internal and external worlds are shaped by the exhilarating and dangerous motivation and passion within all of us.",
