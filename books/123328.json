  "title": "The House in the Dark",
  "description": "Part allegory, part fable, The House In The Dark was written in secret during the German occupation of Norway, and gives a stirring picture of how a society struggled to stay united under the strain of being watched by their invaders. Unusual in Vesaas's oeuvre in that it depicts events in wider society, The House In The Dark is nevertheless as powerful and rewarding as any novel by him",
