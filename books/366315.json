  "description": "An unforgettable coming of age novel for fans of 13 Reasons Why, It’s Kind of a Funny Story , and The Perks of Being a Wallflower . Fifteen-year-old Jeff wakes up on New Year’s Day to find himself in the hospital—specifically, in the psychiatric ward. Despite the bandages on his wrists, he’s positive this is all some huge mistake. Jeff is perfectly fine, perfectly normal; not like the other kids in the hospital with him. But over the course of the next forty-five days, Jeff begins to understand why he ended up here—and realizes he has more in common with the other kids than he thought. “With a sprinkling of dark humor and a full measure of humanness, Suicide Notes is quirky, surprising, and a riveting read.” —Ellen Hopkins, author of  The You I’ve Never Known and Love Lies Beneath “Like the very best teen novels, Suicide Notes is both classic and edgy, timeless and provocative.” —Brent Hartinger, author of Geography Club “Makes a powerful emotional impact.” — Publishers Weekly (starred review)“Jeff’s wit and self-discovery are refreshing, poignant, and, at times, laugh-out-loud funny.” — School Library Journal",
