  "description": "From the author of the widely acclaimed \n\nShe Weeps Each Time You're Born\n\n, a comic tour de female force about a 1980s field hockey team.\nIn the coastal town of Danvers, MA, home of the original 1692 witch trials, the 1989 Danvers Falcons will do anything to make it to the state finals -- even if it means tapping into some devilishly dark powers. In chapters dense with '80s iconography--from Heathers to \"big hair\"--Quan Barry expertly weaves together the individual and collective journeys of this enchanted team as they storm their way to the championship. Helmed by good-girl captain Abby Putnam (a descendant of the infamous Salem accuser Ann Putnam) and her co-captain Jen Fiorenza, whose bleached blond \"Claw\" sees and knows all, the DHS Falcons prove to be wily, original, and bold, flaunting society's stale notions of femininity in order to find their glorious true selves through the crucible of team sport and, more importantly, friendship.",
