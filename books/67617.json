One moment Bishop and I were kissing under the moonlight, and then I had to go and open my big fat mouth.”The bodycount rises in the next chapter of Anja’s afterlife and not in a good way.

At her side is darkly intense Bishop, but how long will their happiness last once her absent Sire reappears? To complicate things, it’s getting increasingly difficult to keep up the façade of humanity among her family and friends, and her school keeps expecting her to go to classes… What’s a vampire to do when ice cream therapy proves ineffective?Torn between the man she loves and the primal lure she feels towards Jakob, Anja must fight for what she wants… just as soon as she figures out what that is.",
