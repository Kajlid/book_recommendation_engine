  "description": "Trig Kelia is employed by the High Ambassador of the Planetary Alliance as a truthseeker. It's the safest place she could be with the secrets that she is keeping. Hiding in plain sight has worked for years to keep her out of the hands of powerful beings that would use her for her gifts. It's safe... as long as no one finds out what she really is.  Captain Tyber Relian, his first mate Lore Trugarian, and the crew of the Jezebel are sent on a rescue mission for a truthseeker. Taking her from the most protected ship in the Alliance is a gamble, but with a megalomaniac like Cor Warrung on her heels they won't take chances. Turns out getting the beautiful seemingly fragile female away from a regiment of elite space marines may be the least dangerous thing they do on this trip.  This romance is MFM, meaning Trig finds herself often pressed between two very different, very protective, men. The fifth book in the distant worlds series. The romance can be read as a stand alone, but the characters and continuing story is better enjoyed when read in order.",
