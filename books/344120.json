The next I’m in an entirely different world, being told I’ve been magically married to a gorgeous, insane fae king who keeps looking at me like he wants to eat me… in one way or another.He thinks that I belong to him, and says that if he has to, he'll burn the whole world down to keep me.I may not be from this place, but it's looking like I’m the only one who can tame the king. And if I can’t… well, then we're all going to go up in flames.",
