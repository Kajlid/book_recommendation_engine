She's envied by all her peers, who all wish to be her, and lives for two things: modelling and partying. When her behavior becomes too wild and out of control, her mother sends her to Connor Hudson's farm in the hopes some time in a humble setting under the watchful eye of a strong, domineering man such as Connor will straighten her up. But Samantha has no intention of changing, not for her family and certainly not for some cowboy she doesn't know.He swore he'd never fall in love again...As a favour to Samantha's mother, Connor agrees to take in the young woman who has been making headlines, in a bad way. But the last thing he expected was that he'd fall for her. As the layers of Samantha's personality are peeled back under his watchful eye, Connor sees so much more than a party girl. Deep down, he sees a woman full of pride, ambition and pain and despite himself, he finds himself falling.Can the hard-as-nails cowboy tame the wild Samantha, without doing the one thing he swore he'd never do and losing his own heart in the process?",
