  "description": "Moscow's top cops are on the case as multiple murders sweep the city. There's Rostnikov, once a hero in the great war against Hitler, recently demoted after clashing with the KGB. There's young Sasha, who looks more like a kid than a cop. And there's Karpo, intelligent and determined, feared by criminals. Together, they would track down the killers -- but what if their search led into forbidden areas, into the Kremlin itself?",
