  "description": "Meet Danny, the last surviving Earth man. Enclosed are his logs about being a space prisoner and his eventual turn of luck as a space fugitive, but that’s entering spoiler territory. Some log topics included are: ‘Why you shouldn’t do space drugs,’ ‘What makes me so special?’ and ‘I really wish I never met the Ramanon species.’ It’s Hitchhiker’s Guide meets Ender’s Game—in space! Oh wait.",
