  "description": "New York Times bestselling author Jason M. Hough dives headfirst into the world of thrillers with this explosive new tale!Welcome to Silvertown, Washington. Population 602 (for now).Despite its small size, the small mountain town is home to more conspiracy theories than any other place in America. Officer Mary Whittaker is slowly acclimating to the daily weirdness of life here, but when the chief of police takes a leave of absence, she is left alone to confront a series of abnormal incidents—strange even by Silvertown standards.An “indoor kid” who abhors nature dies on a random midnight walkabout with no explanation.A hiker is found dead on a trail, smiling serenely after being mauled by a bear.A woman known for being a helicopter parent abandons her toddler twins without a second thought.It’s almost as if the townsfolk are losing their survival instinct, one by one...As Whittaker digs deeper into her investigation, she uncovers a larger conspiracy with more twists and turns than a mountain road, and danger around every corner. To save Silvertown, she must distinguish the truth from paranoia-fueled lies before she ends up losing her own instincts...and her life!",
