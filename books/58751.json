  "description": "Winner--1998 Lenore Marshall Poetry PrizeFinalist--1997 National Book Critics Circle Award\"In Questions for Ecclesiastes, Mark Jarman takes on the idea of holiness in an unholy world, of spiritual realities in secular America... His poems made me think of altars, the kind we sometimes make unconsciously on a side-table or dresser where we deposit sea shells, pebbles, lost buttons, and other interesting finds, arranging them just so, as if to make an offering to an unknown god.\"-Charles Simic, Judge, The Academy of American Poets\"A devout and learned exploration of the absence and silence of God.\"-The Philadelphia Inquirer\"In this deeply impressive collection, Jarman is concerned with God, His grace, and humans' relations with Him... In 20 'Unholy Sonnets,' he takes up matters of theology directly and so appositely for these times that some of them may become pulpit as well as anthology staples.\"-Ray Olson, Booklist\"",
