  "description": "FOUR DAYS FROM INFECTION TO SICKNESS. FOUR DAYS FROM SICKNESS TO DEATH. Damian Lawson might be the lone survivor of the Whiteningâ€”a mysterious illness with a not so mysterious source. And Platsville used to be home to outcasts and farmers, but it's nobody's home anymore. Hidden in his family's pantry-turned-bunker, he'll bide his time to exact revenge on the man and monster who stole everything he loved. But the Whitening is vast, and it's erased men twice his size. Their hollow bodies stain the streets, and Damian's journey to the disease's maker becomes riddled with horrifying realities of unspeakable truths. Realities and revelations that will sever the ties he has left and leave him with a new, disturbing sense of home.",
