  "title": "London's Shadows: The Dark Side of the Victorian City",
  "description": "In 1888 London was the capital of the most powerful empire the world had ever known, and the largest city in Europe. In the west a new city was growing, populated by the middle classes, the epitome of ‘Victorian values'. Across the city the situation was very different. The East End of London had long been considered a nether world, a dark and dangerous region outside the symbolic ‘walls' of the original City.Using the Whitechapel murders of Jack the Ripper as a focal point, this book explores prostitution and pornography, poverty, revolutionary politics, immigration, the creation of a criminal underclass and the development of policing. It also considers how the sensationalist 'new journalism' took the news of the Ripper murders to all corners of the Empire and to the United States. This is the dark underbelly of London's Victorian history.",
