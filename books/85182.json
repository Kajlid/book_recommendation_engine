  "description": "Allies. Spies. Traitors. They are all loyal to someone. When Borgon gains a new ally to aid in his endeavors to end Stace, the goddess girl known as the Shadow Queen, it isn’t just an old enemy. Nara is the one debt Lord Cross owes to his maker. He vowed to never follow through with that debt. Betrothed to Nara at his sired change, he has spent all of his Vampire life trying to make up for that debt he refused from the start. Now she’s after the one he loves. Stace and the marked ones continue to train using their combined powers to follow through with the plan the gods ask of them. It seems impossible at times, but not just the enemy has the ability to gain an ally.",
