  "description": "This is a book on the Art Ensemble Of Chicago -- put together by Lincoln T Beauchamp, aka Chicago Beau. The book's a selection of essays and writings on the group and their muusic -- done by members and associates, most of whom you'd recognize from recordings. Writings include \"Races Places Faces & Asses\" by Hartmut Geerken, \"Odwalla\" by Joseph Jarman, \"Venting For Don, Luba, Ari, & Ken\" by Chicago Beau, \"Full Ancient To The Future\" by Kalamu Ya Salaam, \"Reflections On The Early Days Of The Art Ensemble\" by Chicago Beau, and assorted interviews with members of the group. But even best of all, the book's filled with loads of vintage photos -- all in black and white, and capturing the group at some of their best moments! The whole thing's nice and large, oversized and hardcover.",
