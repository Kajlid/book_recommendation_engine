  "description": "Growing up, I had sworn never to join the family mafia business.Still, I knew too much and I had to, at the very least, be an associate for the Russo family. In the end, I was sent to law school. In an underworld of criminals, I was a necessary commodity—especially when my brothers had recently spilled so much blood and were currently under investigation.I found myself watching out for everyone. Only, I never saw Delaney coming. She was the beautiful daughter of one of the partners at the firm where I worked. She was strictly off limits during a time when I couldn’t afford to be distracted.She was also driven, determined, and refused to accept no for an answer. I never should have touched her, but once I had my first taste, I couldn’t let her go. Delaney stole my heart and I didn't even know I had one.But things were about to get ugly. Her father was running for Attorney General, his goal to take down organized crime and end the mafia reign once and for all. And, my father and brothers were in his crosshairs.There was no way Delaney and I would get a happy ending. No way we'd come out unscathed, especially when my father gives me a very specific job to do that could only end one way. . . with Delaney hating me.",
