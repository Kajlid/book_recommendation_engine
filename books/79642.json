  "description": "When rookie cop, Dave Wolinski is shot during a routine traffic stop, Brandy (who's along for the ride) finds herself face to face with the shooter; drug-crazed, pit bull fighting, gang member, Mario Lewis. Brandy shoots Lewis in self defense and becomes the target of gang retaliation. Things heat up when Lewis, who appeared to be recovering from the wound inflicted by Brandy, suddenly, and mysteriously dies. Brandy has no sympathy for the dog abuser, but figures if she can clear her name, maybe the gang will back off. Soon, Brandy is thrust into a world of dog fighting, gang atrocities and a particularly sadistic gentleman named \"Torch\" whose favorite pastime is setting people on fire.Brandy has the love and support of her newly acquired boyfriend, sexy, mystery man, Nicholas Santiago to help her survive her investigation. Unfortunately, the road to true love has hit a few speed bumps, and their future together is anything but certain. Meanwhile, Brandy's ex-boyfriend Bobby DiCarlo doesn't have the same romantic woes as she does and appears to be moving on with his love life. Thankfully, Brandy, as always, has friends and family who have her back as much as she has theirs, and Brandy is one tough cookie with no plans of crumbling.",
