To make matters more complicated, the detective that shows up to investigate is none other than her last-night lover—Emmett Fisher.They find a series of clues closely tied to Raven’s past, present, and future. As twists and turns drag them both deeper into the case, binding them together in more ways than one, Raven realizes this is one thing she cannot face alone.Perhaps, in the midst of it all, the loneliness she’s ignored in her guarded heart for so long will soon be nevermore.
