  "description": "From New York Times bestselling author Penelope Ward, comes a new forbidden STANDALONE romance.  What happens when the one you want is the only one you can’t have?  My name is Sevin.  Homeschooled and sheltered by my ultra-religious family, I was always taught that lust was a sin.  Elle was the girl who’d been carefully chosen for me.  After a long-distance courtship, I’d be moving into her family’s guesthouse so that we could get to know each other in the months before the wedding.  Boundaries were set: no inappropriate touching, no kissing, no sex before marriage.  I’d accepted those rules and my fate.  Until I met the one I wanted to sin with.  That was when restraint became a problem…especially since THE ONE wasn’t Elle.  It was her sister, Evangeline.  You know what they say about best laid plans.  My name is Sevin, and I have sinned.  **Told in alternating points of view, Sins of Sevin is a full-length standalone novel. Contains graphic sexual content and harsh language. Only appropriate for adult readers age 18+.",
