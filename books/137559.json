  "description": "A young cowhand is working on a new range, gathering cattle and enjoying the quiet country. Just as the job is about to wind down, things get maybe a bit too exciting. Annie and her equine companions trot us through a rollicking character driven western adventure for lovers of horses, and cowboys as they explore a vast and beautiful land. On The Rocks is a wild and laugh filled ride through wildlife filled mountains and prairies with an assortment of boon and not so boon human and animal companions. Soaring vistas and grandiose themes draw the reader into a nostalgic and surprising world.",
