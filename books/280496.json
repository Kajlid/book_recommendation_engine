The kind that isn’t flaunted around. But you can tell by the way they carry themselves. Or maybe the name just refers to the fact that they’re so beautiful it’s almost hard to look at them. No matter the reason for their nickname, it’s an ironic one. Because I’ve only been going to this school for a week and I already want to touch.",
