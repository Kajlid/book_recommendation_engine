  "description": "Ash and Eve were high school sweethearts who were very much in love. But fate intervened and they were torn apart when Ash got an opportunity of a lifetime to become part of an up-and-coming hard rock band called Oblivion. He went away on tour and the band ultimately became very successful. Eve stayed back at college to make the most of her scholarship and complete her business studies degree. They tried to make their relationship work long-distance, but were unsuccessful, leaving them both devastated and heart broken. Neither of them ever got over each other. Seven years later they have a surprise chance meeting, neither of them can deny the strong pull they still have towards each other and they can’t resist the sizzling chemistry that continues to exist between them. They decide to try and rekindle their relationship. This is a story about the fun times that Ash and Eve have rediscovering each other, but it’s also about the struggles and challenges of them trying to merge two very different lifestyles. What obstacles will be thrown their way? and will they be able to make it work this time or will history repeat itself and tear them apart again? Warning: This story is a rock star erotic romance. It contains hot rock stars, sizzling sexual encounters and language that you would expect from heavy rock musicians used to a life of sex, booze and rock and roll. This novel contains graphic love scenes and is strictly adult only. This novel is Part 1 of the 'Oblivion On Tour' Series. However, it can be read as a stand-alone and specifically follows Ash and Eve's story. Other books in the series follow the other band members and their quests for love.",
