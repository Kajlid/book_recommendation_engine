Where every thirteen-year-old receives a definition of their name, one that sets the tone of their life to follow. For centuries, royals have received Namings that mean powerful; leader; protector. Until one. Princess Breslin. Her Naming’s results? Rattled her royal lineage and worse, fractured the once sweet relationship she had with her father the king. ​For years, Breslin vowed to prove to him she’s more than her Naming. That he can trust her; love her. But nothing she did made any bit of difference.Until her brother Colton is Named. Until he too receives mind-numbing results, sending the kingdom into a panic as a once unshakeable tradition begins to unravel. Her father, desperate to conserve order and peace, approaches Breslin for help. This is her chance. She agrees, promising to follow him blindly. ​But as Breslin submits to her father’s plans, she discovers things about the Namings that have been overshadowed for centuries. Dark secrets. And if they’re not exposed, the future of the kingdom could crumble. Breslin’s loyalty is now put to the test. If she departs from her father’s plans she risks never healing their relationship again. But if Breslin ignores what she uncovers, she could be responsible for the kingdom’s demise.",
