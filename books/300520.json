  "description": "After a near drug overdose two years ago, Piper James has it all: the perfect downtown address, a hip bartending gig on south street, and a loyal best friend by her side. Relocating to the city of Philadelphia seems like it was the perfect fresh start to the next chapter of her story, that is until she wakes up with a killer hangover and no recollection of the night before.When a handsome stranger breaks into her apartment, shedding light on her missing memories and insisting she’s a newly turned vampire, Piper has to come to terms with the fact that her life has been turned upside down in a seriously supernatural way.Thrust into the city’s paranormal underworld, a secret vampire society ruled by the ruthless vampire king and suddenly bound to darkness, Piper begins to wonder if it’s possible to live between both worlds while fighting to keep her addictive past from turning into an uncontrollable thirst.",
