  "description": "The fallout of their first encounter with a real Packmaster has left Ana and her pack reeling. So when Vandal’s bestia PI Ten shows up at the Lollipop and asks for help in finding a friend, it’s a great way for them to move forward. On top of that, Ten might just be a perfect addition to Ana’s pack even despite her being a herbivore. However, said friend has been captured by the powerful Core World military, who are hunting down bestiae all over the galaxy. Torn between caution and eagerness to help, Ana and her pack agree to a brief scouting mission to the backwater planet of Sullin. Of course things turn out a little worse than expected. This time, it looks like they have bitten off more than even a carnivore pack can chew. There’s one of Ten’s old friends who might help, but that backstabbing bunny cannot be trusted - and the Core World military has deep, deep pockets… ***This dashing SF adventure novel is the second book of the 'Packmasters' series.",
