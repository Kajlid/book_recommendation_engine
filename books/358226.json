  "description": "Book five in the My Vampire and I Series A lonely vampire thinks he has found the love of his life–but his happiness is threatened by a vampire hunter determined to collect his bounty. When Chris Jeffries is rescued from a vicious beating by a tall dark stranger, it's not difficult to imagine he'd be willing to reward the stranger with more than just a handshake. Getting to know Chris better is very much on Carlos Galeano's mind also–the lonely vampire, still grieving over the death of his lover, feels that at last he has found the one to make his existence more bearable. The two embark on a relationship that, at first, seems to be all they can desire and hope for. But trouble in the guise of Martin Kellogg, a vampire hunter, along with Frank and Billy, two petty criminals, soon disrupts Carlos and Chris's dreams of a happy ever after ending to their idyllic bond. Carlos turns to his friend Marcus Verano for help in thwarting the vampire hunter's attempts to track him down. Martin regards Chris as the bait that will lead him to Carlos, and after a couple of narrow escapes from the hunter, Carlos decides that in order to protect Chris, he must tell him the truth–a decision that may forever end his dream of an enduring love.",
