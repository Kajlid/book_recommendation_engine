  "description": "I’m a breed all of my own. A dark twist of sin women dream to be dominated by. I’ll fuck you so good you’ll be begging me for more. If you leave a lasting impression, I might see you again. But I doubt it. ~ That piece of work was me. The one who was so sure of himself. The one women knelt before, desperate to have a taste of the pleasure I could bring them. Back then I thought I had it all figured out, that my life couldn’t get any more perfect. Rich. Well known. Good looking. But something doused the flames of the cocky asshole I had become, something I thought would never happen. Baby Fever. Yeah…that. Whoever said men didn’t get that shit was a damn liar. The infection had spread through my body, right into my blood, overshadowing what I’d spent my entire adult life enjoying. Now I’m in search of one thing. One person who can turn my world upside down and give me what I crave, while letting me stay true to who I am. So… Dear Ladies, I’m the man of your dreams and I can prove it. All shapes and sizes are welcome. I’m ready to settle down and start a family. Must be open to a long term relationship. The true kind. One that will last forever (contract required and only voided by me). I’ll show you how a woman is really supposed to be treated. Submissive preferred, but not required. Will train. It’s time to Dom up. Sincerely, Devlin Black (To be printed in the Los Angeles Herald, Sunday after next—Bachelor’s Edition. Front Page.) This is NOT a dark erotic romance.",
