  "description": "Psychiatrist Jade Thatcher thinks that returning to her small, Australian hometown to start again, will be a healing experience - until her new job proves to be just the opposite. Her patients are linked in ways that she can’t explain, and the hospital has seen too many doctors come and go. It’s not long before she is lured by a well-guarded secret; one that sends her to a dark and dangerous place, with little hope of returning.",
