  "description": "AMERICA , THIS IS YOU R ROAD MAP TO THE FUTURE—A RETURN TO THE GUIDIN G PRINCI PLES OF OU R FOUNDIN G FATHERS . . .The United States is at a crossroads. Our national debt is rising, our social programs are unsustainable, and our government is expanding at an alarming rate. As American citizens, we have a choice. We can continue on our current path of policies that threaten our freedoms, our families, and our finances—or we can join the powerful new resurgence of the age-old principles that are the foundation of the U.S. Constitution.This book is a wake-up call. Written by acclaimed conservative leaders Ken Blackwell and Ken Klukowski, it is a back-to-basics action plan inspired by the original words and beliefs of our nation’s forefathers. Using the U.S. Constitution, the authors guide us through our current political minefield, showing how both Democrats and Republicans have led our country astray. They reveal startling connections between the crash of the economy, the collapse of the family, and the rise of big government. They lay out a policy agenda of constitutional fixes for our greatest national problems, from retirement, to education, to social issues, to taxes. Finally, they offer Republicans a step-by-step plan for rebuilding the GOP from the ground up, for winning both Congress and the White House, and for changing directions on the road to our future.The time is now, America. The resurgence is under way; we should let nothing stop us. More than two centuries ago, our forefathers gave us the dream and the directions—spelled out in black and white. Now more than ever, we need to embrace those principles and get our country back on track.",
