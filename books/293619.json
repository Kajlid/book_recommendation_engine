  "description": "I’ve had a sense since I was youngthat there’s more going on here, thatthe world is not a cold, dead place,that it’s alive in some compelling andmysterious way.This book is about that sense. I’ve triedto listen to it, and follow it, and trust it.It’s been devastating at times, intoxicatingat others, heartbreaking and maddeningand euphoric——how do you make senseof this experience we’re having here onthis ball of rock hurtling through spaceat 67,000 miles an hour?There are big questions: Everythingis made of particles and atoms, and theuniverse has been expanding for thirteenbillion years?And then there are those other questions, about the people and places andevents that have shaped us.HOWEVER MASSIVE ANDCOSMIC IT ALL IS, IT’S ALSOREALLY, REALLY PERSONAL.AND SPIRITUAL.THAT’S THE WORD FOR IT.That’s the sense I’ve been followingfor a while now——this awareness thatthere’s something bigger happening inthe depth and complexity and struggleof life, something that connects us all,reminding us that it all matters and it’sall headed somewhere.Part memoir, part confession, partextended riff on the endlessly evolvingnature of reality, Everything Is Spiritualis an invitation to see what you’ve beena part of this whole time.",
