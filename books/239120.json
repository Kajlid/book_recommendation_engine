  "description": "Though multiracialism has recently become a popular aspect of many memoirs and novels, \"Mixed\" is the first of its kind: a fiction anthology with racial overlap as its compass. With original pieces by both established and emerging writers, \"Mixed\" explores the complexities of identity that come with being a multiracial person.Every story, crafted by authors who are themselves mixed-race, broaches multiracialism through character or theme. With contributors such as Cristina Garcia, Danzy Senna, Ruth Ozeki, Mat Johnson, Wayde Compton, Diana Abu-Jaber, Emily Raboteau, Mary Yukari Waters, and Peter Ho Davies, and an illuminating introduction by Rebecca Walker, \"Mixed\" gives narrative voice to the multiple identities of the rising generation.Contents:The anthropologists' kids by Ruth OzekiEffigies by Lucinda RoyMinotaur by Peter Ho DaviesMrs. Turner's lawn Jockeys by Emily RaboteauFootnote by Carmit DelmanMy Elizabeth by Diana Abu-JaberGift giving by Mat JohnsonShadey by Stewart David IkedaUnacknowledged by Brian Ascalon RoleyCaste system by Mary Yukari WatersWayward by Chandra PrasadFalling sky by Cristina GarciaThe non-Babylonians by Wayde ComptonHollywood by Marina BudhosHuman mathematics by Mamle KabuBing-Chen by Neela VaswaniThe lost sparrow by Kien NguyenTriad by Danzy Senna",
