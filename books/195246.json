  "title": "Just a Bit Confusing",
  "description": "(Alternate Cover Edition of ASIN B019FNOC92.) Best friends, inseparable since childhood, one in love with the other, the other straight and in love with a woman. Stories like this don’t have a happy ending; James Grayson knows it. He puts on a smile, he laughs, he jokes, and he pretends he’s fine when Ryan kisses his girlfriend in front of him—until he can’t. Except nothing is easy and letting go turns out to be much harder than one might think. Some bonds are too strong to be broken, even for a straight man. And sometimes love and desire can have different faces and layers. A story of two men trying to function without each other and failing. This novel contains explicit M/M content, rough sex, drunk sex, and graphic language.",
