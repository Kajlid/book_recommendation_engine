  "description": "Over the course of fifteen years, Mary Ruefle delivered a lecture every six months to a group of poetry graduate students. Collected here for the first time, these lectures include \"Poetry and the Moon,\" \"Someone Reading a Book Is a Sign of Order in the World,\" and \"Lectures I Will Never Give.\" Intellectually virtuosic, instructive, and experiential, Madness, Rack, and Honey resists definition, demanding instead an utter—and utterly pleasurable—immersion.Mary Ruefle has published more than a dozen books of poetry, prose, and erasures. She lives in Vermont.",
