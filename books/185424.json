  "description": "Age 8-12The legacy of Diary of a 6th Grade Ninja continues in this sequel series about Max - Chase Cooper's great-great-grandson 100 years in the future!My name is Max, and I'm Chase Cooper's great-great-grandson. My life is so lame that every day has started to feel like the same exact day... that is, except for today. The school science club dug up a hundred-year-old time capsule filled with all the usual stuff like books, movies, CDs... a letter that was addressed to me... from my great-great-granddad, Chase Cooper. Crazy, right? His message sent my friends and me on the weirdest scavenger hunt ever, taking us to parts of the school we didn't even know existed, all to find stuff that he had hidden when he was a student. It was the epic adventure I always wanted, but everything spiraled out of control and put my friends in horrible danger. Now I'm the only one who can save them before it's too late... hopefully it's not too late.Middle School Ninja is a funny book for children ages 9-12, middle school students, and adults (who secretly never grew up).",
