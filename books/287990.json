Without a doubt, my favourite read of this year' Christina Dalcher, author of VOX\nIt all happened so quickly. First, animals became infected with the virus and their meat became poisonous. Then governments initiated the Transition. Now, 'special meat' – human meat – is legal.Marcos is in the business of slaughtering humans – only no one calls them that. He works with numbers, consignments, processing. One day, he's given a gift to seal a deal: a specimen of the finest quality.

And soon, he becomes tortured by what has been lost – and what might still be saved…Agustina Bazterrica is an Argentinian novelist and short-story writer.
