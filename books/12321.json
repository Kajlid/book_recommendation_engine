  "title": "Eating Mindfully: How to End Mindless Eating and Enjoy a Balanced Relationship with Food",
  "description": "This book introduces and adapts the concepts of mindfulness and acceptance to the observation and management of eating habits. The result is a series of exercises and meditations that reinforce healthy habits and lead to greater tranquility at meals.The book describes the four foundations of mindful eating: mindfulness of the mind, the body, the feelings, and the thoughts. It doesn't encourage a diet of deprivation, but instead provides a checklist for the wide variety of mindless eating approaches, which include fasting, dieting, and restricting certain foods, rapid eating, eating when not hungry or when tired, and food rituals.",
