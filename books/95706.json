  "description": "Perspective is a powerful thing.Andy Andrews has spent the past five years doing a double take at every white-haired old man he sees, hoping to have just one more conversation with the person to whom he owes his life.Through a chance encounter at a local bookstore, Andy is reunited with the man who changed everything for him — Jones, also known as “The Noticer.”As the story unfolds, Jones uses his unique talent of noticing the little things that make a big difference. And these little things grant the people of Fairhope, Alabama, a life-changing gift — perspective. Along the way families are united and financial opportunities created, leaving us with powerfully simple solutions to the everyday problems we all face.Through the lens of a parenting class at the Grand Hotel in Point Clear, Jones guides a seemingly random group to ask specific questions inspired by his curious advice: “You can’t believe everything you think.” The questions lead to answers for which people have been searching for centuries:- How do we begin to change the culture in which we live?- Can we ensure a life of success and value for our children as they become adults?- What if what we think is the end . . . is only the beginning?What starts as an account of Andy’s everyday reality unfolds into an intriguing story revealing the extraordinary principles available to anyone looking to create a better life.",
