  "description": "A masterpiece of lurid menace from the underbelly of the South.On his first day working for Cochrane's carny, Thaxton found that his new boss was married to his ex-wife. On the second day he found his boss's body--with one of May's throwing knives planted firmly in its chest.With its impeccably rendered carnival setting and its deliriously crooked array of spielers, luck-boys, and dancing girls with indecent hips and sub-zero hearts, Carny Kill is crime fiction at its most devious and pungent.",
