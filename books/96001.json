  "description": "After Evan stays the night, Sadie struggles with returning to the confusion and turmoil of her new everyday life. She is one of them, the others, and Evan isn't. Can she break free from the haze of her mucked up mind without him? Become something else, anything, nothing?She promises herself she will because she wants to. Is it as easy as that, though?When Evan returns to the survivor's camp after spending the night with Sadie, he somehow needs to explain where he's been. Almost everyone is just glad he's back, except Alex, the self-designated group leader. What can Evan tell him that won't send the man into an angry tirade? Will anyone believe him that the \"zombies\" aren't zombies, that they're people, sick and confused and in need of help?No. Alex won't listen. He's too set in his ways, strict and demanding. But Evan might know someone who will at least hear him out...Evan is so wonderful, kind, and nice, and Sadie wants to be close to him. She wants to go on the date he asked her to consider even if she doesn't know how that's possible. Nothing is regular; everything is destroyed. Right?Maybe not. Evan refuses to believe it, anyways.Does emotion, feeling, love... do these things still exist in the world? Or is everything and everyone now Heartless?",
