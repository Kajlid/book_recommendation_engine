  "description": "Two feuding ranchers discover a deep connection in an old silver mine beneath their land in this romance by the New York Times bestselling author.  Now that she’s completed her engineering degree, Rachel Ford Morgan is eager to prove herself to her father and four brothers who run Morgan Ranch. She gets the chance when she discovers fault lines around an abandoned silver mine at the edge of their property. But the troublesome mine is nothing compared to the cowboy who seems determined to shake up her world. Cauy Lymond doesn’t take kindly to the woman nosing around his land—especially since she’s a member of the neighboring Morgan clan. Cauy is determined to keep his father’s failing ranch out of their super-wealthy hands. But he soon realizes that he needs Rachel’s skill—and admirable courage—to shore up the old mine that threatens both their futures. As they pour all of their blood, sweat, and secrets into saving the land, their true feelings for each other begin to surface.This eBook contains bonus content on book research!",
