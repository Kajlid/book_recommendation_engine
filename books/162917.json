  "description": "When Mitchell Wallace halts his suicidal plunge from an overpass to save the life of a lamb who wanders onto the freeway, he sets into motion a chain of events that forever alters his destiny and lives of his best friend and sister. Together they are thrust into a terrifying and hilarious battle between good and evil that has them fleeing a band of shadow demons, a horde of the undead, facing off against an ancient enemy and on the road trip from hell to seek the lost staff of Ba'al; the only thing keeping the earth from being overtaken by Satanic forces. If they don't kill each other first, they just might save mankind.",
