  "title": "Imaginary Museums: Stories",
  "description": "In this collection of compact fictions, Nicolette Polek transports us to a gently unsettling realm inhabited by disheveled landlords, a fugitive bride, a seamstress who forgets what people look like, and two rival falconers from neighboring towns. They find themselves in bathhouses, sports bars, grocery stores, and forests in search of exits, pink tennis balls, licorice, and independence. Yet all of her beautifully strange characters are possessed by a familiar and human longing for connection: to their homes, families, God, and themselves.Miniature catastrophes --The rope barrier --Coed picnic --Winners --Grocery story --Garden party --Arranged marriage --American interiors --A house for living --The dance --The nearby place --Invitation --Doorstop --Imaginary museums --Your shining trapdoor --Slovak sceneries --Sabbatical --Flowers for Angelika --Thursdays at Waterhouse --The seamstress --How to eat well --Owls fall in Nitra --Library of lost things --Girls I no longer know --Guest books --Field notes --Rest in pieces --Pets I no longer have --The squinter's watch --Love language",
