  "description": "Against the violent, colorful backdrop of New Orleans' Mardi Gras, the Penetrator joins the festivites with a bang-- literally-- as he blows up an eighty-thousand-ton canner ship belonging to Raoul Bouchet.It seems that Raoul Bochet is the powerful head of the Gulfland Fisherman's Co-op... Bouchet and his goons are terrorizing the independent Gulf Coast fishermen into joining his organization so that he can corner the market on all the wholesale and retail sales of seafood-- and reap ugly profits from the hunger of U.S. citizens, who've got enough shortages to deal with already...Angelique Rubidaux is the attractive, unwitting link to the evidence that can defeat Bouchet. Before his death, her father passed her the information about where the evidence is hidden; but the riddle is so obscure that it takes Mark Hardin to decipher it. And Bouchet wants Angelique dead before that happens.The Penetrator must move quickly to find the key to defeat Bouchet's plan to exploit millions of Americans.",
