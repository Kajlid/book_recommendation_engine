  "description": "Siri Alvarsson holds the fate of the world in her hands. She's on a mission to find a cure for a sinister antiserum that destroys the light in fae and humans alike. Her whole life has been leading up to this moment: training in martial arts and parkour with her mom, learning the old legends and traveling the world. But nothing prepared her to enter the hidden world of the fae, the most ancient race on the planet. In just a few short months, she's started having strange visions, discovered that her parents are both Light fae warriors, been attacked by her ex-boyfriend's family, and fallen hard for a gorgeous elite Light Guard. It's time for Siri to decide which side she will choose. The Light claim they want to protect the planet, humans included, and the Shades say they have humans best interests at heart. The pressure is on to choose the dark or the light. The futures of humanity, the fae, and the entire planet all depend on Siri. Which side will she choose? Can she find the antidote she needs to heal the fae and stop the evil plans of the Shade Council? Can one girl really save the world alone? Ellis Loganâ€™s new YA Fantasy series, Inner Origins, is action-packed with magic and romance. The story combines fairies, Celtic/Norse mythology, and hollow earth theory to create an adventure you will never forget.",
