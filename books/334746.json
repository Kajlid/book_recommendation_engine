  "description": "In the concluding 50-page half of Jaime's outrageous, acclaimed, full-on superhero mash-up \"Ti-Girls Adventures,\" our protagonist, rookie do-gooder Boot Angel, learns more hard lessons about becoming a superheroine. Featuring wall-to-wall action ending in a big superhero family reunion that unexpectedly takes place in Maggie's tiny, messy one-bedroom apartment. Meanwhile, Gilbert turns in two mind-benders of his own. \"Hypnotwist\" is Gilbert's 39-page epic story of a beautiful, leggy redhead's surreal journey into a night filled with mysterious shady characters, dreamlike violence, and sparkling retro spike heels. But is it real, or something else? For readers trying to parse the truth, Gilbert ups the ante by telling the whole story without using a single word. And \"Sad Girl\" is the tale of a disaffected young bombshell actress nicknamed \"Killer\" and the web of jealousy, gossip, notoriety and mystery that surrounds her.",
