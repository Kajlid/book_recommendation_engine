  "description": "A bachelor auction. I was in a f-ing bachelor auction. I wasn't a cow. A bull, definitely. When the ladies started to bid, it was looking rough.Until she placed the winning bid. The one I wanted. The woman who'd kneed me in the balls the other day. Yeah, I was hot for a woman who wanted nothing to do with me. I was a guy obsessed. She might be the teacher, but she was going to learn she was all mine and I wasn't letting her go. If being a cowboy isn't enough, Sawyer's the town's fire chief. This book might burn up your ereader, but don't worry, he'll be there to put out the flames!",
