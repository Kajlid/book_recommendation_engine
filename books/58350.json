  "title": "The Book of Promethea",
  "description": "In writing Le Livre de Promethea Hélène Cixous set for herself the task of bridging the immeasurable distance between love and language. She describes a love between two women in its totality, experienced as both a physical presence, and a sense of infinity. The result is a stunning example of Pecriture feminine that won praise when first published in France in 1983. Its translation into English by Betsy Wing will extend the influence of a writer already famous for her novels and contributions to feminist theory. In her introduction Betsy Wing notes the contemporary emphasis on \"fictions of presence.\" Cixous, in The Book of Promethea, works to \"repair the separation between fiction and presence, trying to chronicle a very-present love without destroying it in the writing.\"",
