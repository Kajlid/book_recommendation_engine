  "title": "The Awakening of Faith",
  "description": "This text is a short treatise, but its importance is out of all proportion to its length, since it provides a comprehensive summary of the essentials of Mahayana Buddhism. It discusses the question of how man can transcend his finite state and participate in the life of the infinite while still remaining in the midst of the phenomenal order and concludes with a discussion of the particular practices and techniques that will aid the believer in the awakening and growth of his faith.",
