  "description": "No day is better than Friday! Friday is my favorite day.All week long, a boy and his father look forward to their Friday ritual―breakfast at their favorite diner. The leisurely walk through the neighborhood is just as good as the pancakes at the end. Dan Yaccarino's bright, distinctive art style and sweet, simple story about father-son bonding make Every Friday an all-around crowd-pleaser. The weekly tradition will appeal to children who have similar routines with their parents, and kids who don't have such a tradition will be asking their dads to start one! It's a perfect gift book, too―just in time for Father's Day. Every Friday is a 2007 New York Times Book Review Best Illustrated Book of the Year and a 2008 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.",
