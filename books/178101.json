Just as hope was about to leave her entirely, she is rescued by three huge men with Fallen MC patches on their backs; The Musketeers. Bianca clings to them for protection and comfort but little does she know what they want in return. Will Bianca be able to save her sisterâ€™s family, and in doing so will she get an unconventional one of her own?Bones, King and Digger have finally found the woman for them but nothing is ever simple in a MC world. They will do whatever it takes to keep Bianca safe and by their sides forever. Can they get her to accept all three men as hers and change their triad into a tribe?This can be read as a stand-alone or as part of the Fallen MC series. This is a m/m/f/m book, therefore there are m/m elements. If this is not to your taste, please skip this book. Recommend for 18+ readers.",
