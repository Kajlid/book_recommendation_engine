  "description": "Introducing Majella O'Neill, the lovable heroine of this darkly comic and highly original Irish debut. Majella O'Neill is happiest out of the spotlight, away from her neighbors' stares and the narrow-minded gossips of the small village in Northern Ireland where she grew up during the Troubles. She lives a quiet life caring for her alcoholic mother, working in the local chip shop, watching the regular customers come and go. She wears the same clothes every day (overalls, too small), has the same dinner each night (fish and chips, microwaved after the pubs close), binge watches episodes of Dallas from the comfort of her bed (best show on TV). She has a long list in her head of things that she sees the point of, including eating, sex, her da, her granny, and cleaning, and a much longer list, complete with categories and subcategories, of things \"she isn't keen on.\" Sometimes, she thinks, that list can be condensed into one item: other people. People are just too confusing for her. Â Big Girl, Small Town takes place in 2004 during the week after the funeral of Majella's grandmother, whose mysterious death shatters Majella's safe and predictable existence and makes her an object of fascination in the town. As much as she wants things to go back to normal, Majella comes to realize that maybe there is more to life than the chip shop, the pub, and the town of Aghybogey. And it might just be that from tragedy comes Majella's one chance at escape. Introducing a truly original voice and a truly original heroine, Big Girl Small Town should appeal to lovers of both literary and commercial fiction.",
