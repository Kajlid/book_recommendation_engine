  "description": "Barbara Mahoney, known behind her back as Bossy Barbs, excels at all things practical and insists that almost all life’s problems can be fixed with her hammer–and her in charge! But her accustomed mastery of events unravels when she is confronted with a village myth, linking her future to a complete stranger. And if that isn’t enough to throw her off course, a secret love returns to lure her away from her beloved village. With two men–one to steer clear of, the other to moon over–is she truly free to choose her own destiny, or is it already decided for her? Supported by an eclectic and quirky community, including the odd ghost or two and a rescued dog, she surprises everyone, most of all herself, with the choices she makes. A tale with a twinkle!",
