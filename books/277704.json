  "title": "Mrs. Dalloway",
  "description": "The annotated, authorized edition of a great literary masterpiece of the twentieth century with commentary by Women’s Studies professor Bonnie Kime Scott. This brilliant novel explores the hidden springs of thought and action in one day of a woman's life and is one of the most “moving, revolutionary artworks of the twentieth century” (Michael Cunningham). Clarissa Dalloway is preoccupied with the last-minute details of preparation for a party while in her mind she is something much more than a perfect society hostess. As she readies her house for friends and neighbors, she is flooded with remembrances of the past—the passionate loves of her carefree youth, her practical choice of husband, and the approach and retreat of war. And, met with the realities of the present, Clarissa reexamines the choices that brought her there, hesitantly looking ahead to the unfamiliar work of growing old. From the introspective Clarissa, to the lover who never fully recovered from her rejection, to a war-ravaged stranger in the park, the characters and scope of Mrs. Dalloway reshape our sense of ordinary life and reshaped English literature as we know it. This authorized edition from the Virginia Woolf library This annotated edition is the perfect companion to more fully understand  Mrs. Dalloway , its importance in twentieth century literature, and Virginia Woolf's world.",
