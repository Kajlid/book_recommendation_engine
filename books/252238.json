  "description": "From the book: To keep a home library attractive and bright requires a little care and a lot of common sense. You don't need to treat books like delicate SÃ¨vres vases, liable to self-destruct at the mere presence of a toddler, but neither should they be manhandled like the morning newspaper. Take care of the books you have, and you will have books worth taking care of. Michael Dirda",
