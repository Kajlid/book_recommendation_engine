  "title": "Cordelia Underwood: Or, The Marvelous Beginnings of the Moosepath League",
  "description": "Redolent of the knockabout high jinks of Tom Jones and The Pickwick Papers, Cordelia Underwood, set in 1896 during an idyllic summer on the coast of Maine, has a Yankee charm all its own.In the sea chest of her late uncle, the lovely redhead Cordelia Underwood finds the deed to a parcel of land, where something mysterious may be buried. Drawn into Cordelia's story are the bighearted and wise Tobias Walton--a jolly, portly gentleman--and his trio of hapless friends, the exuberant founders of the Moosepath League. Making appearances along the way are rascally old salts and smugglers, yarn spinners, grandes dames, and prospective beaus. There are apparitions, opinionated relatives, runaway horses, Maude the fugitive bear--and the moose that put the moose in the Moosepath League!From a strange deathwatch to a lady's July 4th parachute jump from a hot-air balloon in \"an attractive pair of tights,\" Cordelia Underwood is filled with humor, suspense, and old-fashioned wonderment, romance, and adventure. Superbly written, with a vivid sense of place and period, and characters that leap off the page, this is a surefire word-of-mouth success and a book for any day that begs a few hours of pure delight.",
