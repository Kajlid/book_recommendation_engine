  "description": "Babylon: a city of legendary richness, a civilization as sophisticated as it is decadent, provides fertile and fabulous backdrop for the final installment of the time travel series that began in ancient Egypt, transported us to a doomed Greek island inhabited by Gods, traveled to the court of the Biblical king David, and culminates with a historical adventure of epic proportion.When Chloe and Cheftu find themselves in Babylon, they again step into lives not their own. Cheftu is an Aryan soldier, Chloe a beautiful Jewish goldsmith. From their relative positions, they are plunged into the intrigues of a city on the edge of invasion, as the fiery young Cyrus, future emperor of Persia prepares to seize Babylon. First, however, the would-be sovereign must find three sacred golden objects, objects shrouded in mystery and invested with mythic power. Objects that Chloe just happens to possess. The wisecracking heroine (now uncomfortably pregnant with twins) becomes the inadvertent object of a massive and deadly treasure hunt, as a doomed ruler, a future King, a prophet and several armies join a search for a magical prize. Blending Biblical narrative, ancient legend, high adventure and a heavy helping of passion, Twilight Over Babylon will delight fans of fantasy, history, and romance alike.",
