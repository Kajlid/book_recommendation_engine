  "description": "In the frenetic world of canine pageants like Westminster, where dog hair flies and personalities diverge, Rebecca Lee remains in a cocoon of loneliness. Widowed, with two teenaged kids and a business to run, Rebecca would rather mow through five-hundred poodle cuts than think about dating. But when former quarterback Matt Johnson shows up to buy a Chihuahua, his irresistible grin rocks her world--until Matt's ex decides she wants him back and Rebecca's daughter decides she's against her mom dating. Rebecca now has a choice--crawl back into her realm of dogs or fight for the powerful love that fills her soul.",
