Feeling lost, Cole returns home to the mining town of Gemstone, Colorado hoping to reconnect with his past and his high school sweetheart, Anna Vanner. Except, life has changed in Gemstone. Vanner Mines have closed, putting the town in jeopardy and Anna is about to say “I Do” to the another man. Trading his guitar for a hammer, Cole finds a peace and a purpose restoring the community church and the little tomato vineyard his dad left to him. He’s on the road to recovery until Anna calls off her wedding and Vanner Mining makes a claim for his land. Cole might have quit Nashville, but he’s not about to give up on his legacy or his love for Anna. With the help of a youth group, Daisy, a tomato-thieving mutt, and good friends, Cole discovers there’s more to life than gold or gold records. There’s love, family, and roots that run deep. Because in Gemstone, you can’t keep the truth or true love buried for long. This is a sweet longer length country romance novella suitable for ages 16 plus.",
