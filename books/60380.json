Haunted by visions of a bleeding tree growing atop a blackened skull, Michael kills priests and kings in an attempt to ensure the birth of the prophesied Heir. But will he go too far?A 7-book series released in 3 volumes, The Chronicles of Time is a fantasy-inspired Christian mythos that plunges the reader into the supernatural world of Michael the archangel. A behind-the-scenes take on the angelic and demonic powers that move history, this epic series follows Michael, the commander of the Malakim, as he battles against Hashatan, the dark lord who seeks to usurp King Elyon’s throne and take rule of Shamayim. History and fantasy collide as the ultimate struggle between good and evil rages on in a war that spans millennia.Ex-goth turned apologist, JC left home at 17 convinced by her father (a pastor) that God couldn't look at her, let alone hear her prayers. Needless to say, she didn't bother reading the Bible, until one day she accidently discovered the God of love in the pages of the Old Testament. Hoping to reach others who had been turned off by Christianity, she spent 10 years researching and writing Prophecy of the Heir—a fantasy-inspired version of the Bible that reflects how she now sees a suspenseful, action-packed, battle-ridden love story.",
