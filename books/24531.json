  "title": "Winner Takes All: Master/slave Fantasies by Christopher Pierce",
  "description": "The prolific author Christopher Pierce (christopherpierceerotica.com) has appeared in practically every gay magazine and more than three dozen story anthologies. Winner Takes All , his newest collection, offers the title novella and 16 shorter stories about gay Master/slave relationships, ranging from the edgiest to the most romantic with every variation in between. While only a few stories are set in other times or other worlds than our own, they are all sex fantasies, not slices of life. Their aim is to entertain, which they do splendidly. Advance readers of Winner Takes All have said that \"Masters and slaves pop off the pages like heroic figures from the leather underworld\" (Jay Starre) in \"lip-smackingly kinky tales\" (Jeff Mann) featuring \"beautiful language, touching characterization, poignant plotting, and a full-bodied eroticism\" (M. Christian, in his Foreword). The stunning original cover images are by Thom Magister, himself a Perfectbound Press author ( The Slave Journals and Other Tales of the Old Guard ).",
