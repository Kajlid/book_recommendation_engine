  "description": "Ready, Aim, Murder! American actress, Anna McKay, is thrilled to be part of the Cavendish Manor cast, filming a period drama at an English country estate. She looks forward to working with her handsome co-star, but is equally intrigued by the new assistant to the director. A series of practical jokes on set causes her to fear someone is sabotaging the show, and her equilibrium is further off-balance when she has inexplicable visions that hint of the house’s sinister past. When the practical jokes turn deadly, Anna isn’t sure who to trust, or if she will make it out of Cavendish Manor alive!",
