He returns to her five years later as an embittered zombie hunter. Tattooed. Angry. Determined. But Mona's not that spoiled teenager anymore. She's a grown woman who has seen and lost far too much. And she needs his heart more than his fury if they're going to survive. With a hungry horde of the walking dead literally on their doorstep, Emran and Mona must put the past behind them and fight for their future.A 10,700-word romance with a guaranteed happy ending. (Yes, even in the middle of a zombie apocalypse.)",
