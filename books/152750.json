Then surrounding her feet and leading her in her trance-like state out the door in the middle of the night to the cemetery down the road...This is one of many night terrors and strange urges to visit a certain little girl's grave that Maryanne Rosa has been experiencing for weeks. Someone from beyond is using them to push her towards uncovering horrific secrets about the publisher of the rising political magazine she’s an editor of.Prerogative magazine's publisher, Joseph Goldberg, is also a leader of a cult of racist elitists. They've parlayed the death of six-year-old Cecily to gain further control of the quaint upstate New York town where Maryanne and her close-knit group of friends live. And as they all get closer to understanding who Joseph truly is, the cult becomes hell bent on claiming some of them as their own and removing others from their path entirely.Hopefully whoever—or whatever—is trying to warn them will get through, before it's too late.There's a NEW legend in Sleepy Hollow.....",
