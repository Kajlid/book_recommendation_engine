Max Dane, an eleven-year-old boy turning twelve on Samhain, now known as Halloween, may be the only key to opening it. But maybe it should stay sealed.As if moving to a new town isn’t scary enough, Max has epileptic seizures that cause hallucinations, but his new friends try to convince him he’s having psychic visions via the Nexus. Max’s visions keep taking him back to Samhain during the middle ages, where he meets a tortured soul in the form of an eight-year-old boy named Jack. Max decides he’s going to help release Jack from his torment, even if it costs him his own sanity. His only chance at doing that is to traverse the Nexus and brave a fierce entity known as the Knightmare. And to traverse the Nexus he must explore mystical and spiritual practices like drumming, fire ceremonies, meditation and tarot, which launch him not only through the Nexus but on a journey of self-discovery that he may regret.Book 1 of 4—Autumn. This book series is set within a year span of Max’s arrival to Ravencrest, Vermont. Inspired by Celtic, Norse, and Native American mythology.",
