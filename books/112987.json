  "description": "Rachel Hoffman is a smart and talented economics journalist, but a lay-off forces her to take a job with a NYC gossip magazine to make ends meet. When she’s assigned to spend a week with Leo Hanlon, the intensely private CEO of a private jet company, she assumes it will be just another run-of-the mill interview. The one thing she doesn’t know: her boss has led the notoriously press-shy Leo to believe the resulting story will be a business profile, not a gossip article.Leo Hanlon hates doing publicity, but with his company still reeling from a PR nightmare, he knows he can’t afford to say no to what he believes is a write-up in a major economics magazine. As they jet from the high rises of Manhattan to the sandy beaches of a tropical island, Rachel and Leo realize the simple business agreement is developing into something far more complicated. They can’t deny their mutual attraction, but similar past tragedies have left them both reluctant to share their hearts with anyone. Can they overcome their fears to find happiness together? Or will the discovery of someone else’s lie tear them apart forever?",
