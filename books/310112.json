  "description": "I shouldn’t love him, my best friend Briston Nicholls. He doesn’t bat for my team. And he’s all feminine and prissy, loving lipgloss on his plump kissable lips more than I do.  And that’s not even mentioning that he’s in love with his complete opposite, the total jock package of the soccer team captain, Braeden Chappell. I'm not expecting to fall for the bad boy too but when lines are crossed and secrets are revealed I’m wondering if it’s possible to love more than one guy?",
