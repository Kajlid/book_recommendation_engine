  "title": "Tender Obsession",
  "description": "Down in the bayou, in the culturally rich city of New Orleans, an upheaval ensued during the season of Mardi Gras. A well-known, well-loved state politician found himself in a heap of trouble during an election year. An African-American, Lieutenant Muskrat of the New Orleans Police Department, was assigned to handle the case…reluctantly.  In the midst of the turmoil, a young, beautiful woman of Asian descent by the name of Ko Jung who also happens to be an escort, alias Muffin Won, turned both of their worlds upside-down.  Two people are thrust together by circumstance, expanding the boundaries of normal relations.  A marriage occurred before any relationship developed; an opened one at that, which slowly and steadily becomes a by-product of both partners’ over commitment towards the other. A distinct line is drawn between sexuality and true intimacy. A battle between conditional obsession and unconditional affection emerges.",
