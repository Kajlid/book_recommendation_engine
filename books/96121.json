  "description": "Every girl dreams of a handsome Prince Charming to whisk her away to a fairytale ending. For Del Ryan it seemed unlikely, but that’s exactly what happened.In 1874, New York booms with prosperity and conspicuous consumption with a clear social divide between classes. Del Ryan, an intelligent and talented Irish immigrant, works as a lady’s maid for a society matron. Although plain and unassuming, she is an accomplished artist with the gift of clairvoyance. She meets Killian Arthur, a golden god from a privileged New York family. Fascinated by her, Killian transforms Del into a fine lady, the toast of her new class of friends.But things are not always what they seem. Rough Irish Jimmy Sheehan has always thought of Del as his own and warns her that there is something not quite right about her suitor. Is he simply jealous, or does he want the best for the woman he loves?Then the fairytale takes a violent turn when girls from Del’s neighborhood start turning up dead. Del witnesses the murders through her disturbing visions and realizes that with each new victim, the killer is getting closer. Will his identity be revealed before he comes for her?",
