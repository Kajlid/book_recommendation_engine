  "description": "Can a blunt pragmatist and a hopeful romantic design a perfect relationship? Caroline Winters' architectural career is her top priority. Her Number One rule has always been 'No Relationships'. But when she's selected as the lead designer of the Calderone Industries office complex, that rule is put to the test when she must work with the owner's son. He is artistic and gorgeous but why won't he let her do the job she's qualified to do? Charles Calderone is a connoisseur of all fine things and knows there's more to life than just a job. His VP position in the family business has always had its challenges, but this architect is driving him to distraction. She is talented and beautiful but has the infuriating habit of confronting him on every design decision! Tempers flare and sparks fly as their professional and personal lives collide. Can they find a way to navigate through their endless power struggles to complete this project successfully? Or will both their careers end up in ruins? Designing Love, Book Three in the Calderone Family Romance series, is a smart and sassy stand-alone romcom.",
