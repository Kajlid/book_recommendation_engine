  "description": "Welcome to Bard Academy, where a group of supposedly troubled teens are about to get scared straight.When Miranda, a slightly spoiled but spirited 15-year-old from Chicago, smashes up her father's car and goes to town with her stepmother's credit cards, she's shipped off to Bard Academy, a boarding school where she's supposed to learn to behave. Gothic and boring and strict, it's everything you'd expect of a reform school. But all is not what it seems at Bard...For starters, Miranda's having horrific nightmares and the nearby woods are eerily impossible to navigate. The students' lives also start to mirror the classics they're reading-tragic novels like Dracula, Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. So Miranda begins to suspect that Bard is haunted-by famous writers who took their own lives-and she senses that not all of them are happy. Complicating things even more is the fact that Ryan Kent-a cute, smart, funny basketball player who went to Miranda's old high school-landed himself in Bard, too. And the attention he's showing Miranda is making some of the other girls white as ghosts. Something ghoulish is definitely brewing at Bard, and Miranda seems to be at the center of ominous events, but whether it's typical high school b.s. or otherworldly danger remains to be seen.",
