Everything.  Except…  This year she’s in charge of the holiday bake sale. Not the best way to avoid Christmas.  Then Austin Sullivan returns to town and literally runs into Merry sprawled on the sidewalk among boxes of smashed cookies. Austin is all about Christmas and offers help with the baking and the sale. Merry’s carefully hidden memories of Christmas past begin to resurface.  Will Austin’s love of the holidays and a single lost ornament bring the magic of Christmas back into Merry’s life?  A short holiday story in the Indigo Bay Sweet Romance Series.",
