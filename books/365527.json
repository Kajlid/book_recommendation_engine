  "title": "The Fallen",
  "description": "Nicholas Reynolds had messed up: he'd taken two party drugs that didn't get along with each other. Now, his glamorous Saturday night plans had been reduced to throwing up in a thin, lightless alley. Up until tonight, Nick had been doing well enough, even by Los Angeles standards. A model-slash-actor of respectable success, he was young, healthy, very attractive, and the hub of his requisite clique. He was generally popular and appreciated although perhaps not enough by the guy he was dating who, interestingly, insisted they were not dating. Though, what made this particular evening truly remarkable for Nick was not his life-threatening overdose. No, it was the enormous demon who also thought Nick's lightless, Hollywood alley might be a good place to hide... In his triumphant first foray into full-length novels, Joshua Dagon has unleashed the rich and compelling tale of the fallen angel, Marbas, and the circle of friends who risk everything to oppose a dark and growing evil. Set in the vainglorious world of the Los Angeles club scene, these novels adeptly confront dogma, addiction, ambition, and revenge with the powerful forces of optimism, friendship, redemption, and above all, love. By the end of The Fallen, readers are whole-heartedly caught up in the lives of the characters, and upon completion of Demon Tears, they long for another chance to laugh and cry with Joshua Dagon's beautifully crafted characters.",
