  "description": "She is not about to be a pawn in anyone’s game—not even the gods. Not even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice . . . Lyllith, the last of the royal line of Érainn, has become the rightful war-prize of Riv Orrsa, her kingdom’s ruthless conqueror. The choice she faces—living as wife to the man who raped her land who murdered her father, or death—is no choice at all. Imprisoned in a lonely tower on a deserted headland, she waits for death as though waiting for an old friend. But when a strange young boy appears in her barren cell one night, Lyllith is offered the only thing still worth living for: a chance of revenge. Accepting that chance plunges her in the middle of a contest thousands of years in the making, for the young boy is not what he seems, her new freedom is illusory, and she is the unwitting heir to an ancient bloody legacy with the power to destroy the World. A brand-new epic fantasy novel by the author of The Alecto Initiative.",
