  "description": "Man has warred for centuries with the reptilian race called \"Basics\". The winner of each bloody encounter has made slaves of the loserâ€”but in this far-future conflict each side improves its slaves with genetic engineering. On Aerlith, men have bred Basics into fearsome troops; on Coralyne, Basics have developed grotesque mutant human warriors. The mysterious Sacerdotes watch and wait for Aerlith and Coralyne's final contest.Hugo Award winner, 1963.",
