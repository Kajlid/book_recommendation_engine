  "description": "This \"boxed set\" of CRIME BUFF'S GUIDES TO OUTLAW ARIZONA and OUTLAW NEW MEXICO combines them in a single volume and continues the popular series that critics, true-crime fans, historians and travelers have hailed as \"the ultimate guilty pleasure,\" \"thorough and unflinching,\" and \"the best damn crime travel series ever published!\" This rollicking romp across the historic American Southwest promises all the can't-look-away allure of its predecessors ... and a few surprises! From Jodi Arias to Wyatt Earp, this is a trip to the desert's darker side, where seemingly idyllic places reveal the compound of a child-molesting polygamist, the quaint bridge where atomic spies sparked the Cold War, the spot where John Dillinger was arrested for the last time, the scenes of Billy the Kid's many crimes, and many more. With photographs, maps, directions, and precise GPS coordinates, this collection of outlaw tales is both a travel guide and an entertaining and enlightening read.",
