  "description": "Garrett Heskan isn’t sure which is worse… going to war against the Hollarans while commanding an untested starship, or reporting to Lt. Commander Durmont. Lieutenant Heskan knows his escort destroyer, BRS Kite, must protect the fleet carriers assigned to Durmont’s escort squadron, but with his ill-prepared ship, the squadron’s arrogant commander and the fledgling nature of stellar aviation, Heskan’s work is cut out for him. What starts out as a simple Brevic attack into the Hollaran Commonwealth soon becomes a fight for survival in a series of battles that could alter the balance of power in the known universe. Conflicts abound in No Way to Start a War, between fleets, leaders, and cultures. This is Book 2 in the This Corner of the Universe series, continuing the story of the original crew of BRS Anelace.",
