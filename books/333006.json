  "description": "Doctor, I can't remember. I can't recall‚a single‚thing. The strange girl whom Judy calls 'Honey' appears to have no memory of her past. Honey's sweet disposition endears her to both the Bolton and the Dobbs families, but Judy begins to wonder if Honey is hiding something. Honey's behavior is strange, and she is evasive when questioned about her actions. Adding to Judy's suspicion is the fact that Honey was in the company of thieves when she had the accident that caused her memory loss. There is also the matter of the invisible chimes, which ring from an invisible source, and usually when Honey is around. The source of the invisible chimes is soon revealed, and Judy's faith in Honey is greatly shaken. In a bizarre twist, Honey learns a startling secret about her past that will change her life forever.",
