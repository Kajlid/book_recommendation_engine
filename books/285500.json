I’m used to getting my way and I’ll do anything to have him. Even call him daddy. But after one night, I still haven’t learned my lesson. \nDear Reader: Samuel is the perfect equation. Can you do the math? Brains + Braun = the total package. Will this be on the test? Definitely.We hope you studied.Love, AJ + Rebecca",
