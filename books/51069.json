  "title": "Relentless Goodbye: Grief and Love in the Shadow of Dementia",
  "description": "Ginnie Horst Burkholder shares from the heart about caring for a spouse who is slowly slipping away to Lewy body dementia (LBD). Burkholder's memoir reveals how she handles the constant challenges through humor, love, commitment, and faith. At the same time, she does not gloss over the loss, pain, and loneliness on this emotional roller coaster ride that invaded her marriage and family following her husband's diagnosis.The book is about the gritty and glorious substances of life--how illness and health, faith and doubt, grief and acceptance all flow together in the river of change. It leads each of us to a greater awareness of our own life experiences.Study questions are included. They are not only a tool for understanding dementia or the role of caregivers but can bring greater self-awareness to every person's life experience.",
