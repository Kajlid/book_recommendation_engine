  "description": "“Mean” Dean Bennett is a hot professional hockey player with a quick smile and a hot temper, and he’s used to getting what he wants in or out of the ice rink. He’s all business out on the ice, but he has a devilishly naughty dominant side behind closed doors. He’s a charming but tough alpha male with a soft spot for his best friend, Sarah.  Sarah has secretly loved Dean since their teenage years, but has always maintained her distance, supporting her best friend while maintaining a hard boundary with her deeper feelings. After all, what better way to ruin a great friendship than adding romance to the mix?  When Sarah catches Dean’s girlfriend doing something—or someone—she shouldn’t, she is torn between telling her best friend the truth and keeping what she saw to herself. Could telling the truth be the beginning of the end of her longest friendship? Or could it be the start of something she’s always wanted?  This 20,000 word sports romance novella is a standalone work with an HEA that is just too hot to keep the doors closed! May cause blushing when read in public—reader beware!",
