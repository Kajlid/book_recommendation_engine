In fact, all her classmates are obsessed with playing their instruments. And odd things happen when they do.But something is off about the school. Deaths have occurred through the years, students showing up dead the same way November's parents were killed—with their throats ripped out.A killer is on the loose... November must figure out a way to stop whoever it is, balance her feelings for Vincent, and solve her parents' past before she, too, is numbered among the dead.The first in a Paranormal Fantasy Saga by debut author Morgan Shamy.",
