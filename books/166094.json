Copy & paste into your browser: http://bit.ly/girl-free ** At first glance, Kristin Krull is just your ordinary high school cheerleader. Pretty, popular, and smart, her main concerns in life include squabbling with her boyfriend and working through her complicated feelings for her childhood best friend, Jon Parker. Kristin doesn't remember anything about the night that intruders from another world took her family hostage. She doesn't remember seeing Jon transform into a panther before her eyes. All she knows is that she's been having horrible nightmares for the past six weeks. Everything changes one night when Kristin discovers she has a talent no one knew about or expected. It's a talent that leads her into other worlds, unlocks the mystery of her nightmares, and forces her into an alliance with her worst enemy. Suddenly she has more to navigate than the high school social scene; lives are on the line, and if Kristin doesn't learn how to control her new ability soon, she'll have blood on her hands.",
