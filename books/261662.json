  "description": "Meet Tommy Musgrove and his two friends John and Glenn. They are all ten year-old kids living in Midland, Texas in the year 1979. All of them are enjoying the freedom and happiness of growing up and being carefree as they enjoy special pastimes such as collecting tadpoles, building plastic models, listening to Led Zeppelin, playing board games, and obsessing over Wonder Woman as they indulge in the magic of childhood, a good deal of it in their “Secret Sanctuary.” One day, a man named Andrew Scottsdale, the handsome, sophisticated member of the city council that the entire city adores and who seems to be the consummate politician and respected member of the community enters their lives, but he is in reality a depraved human monster that has already killed once in order to obtain his goals and would be more than willing to do so again. They are the only ones in the city who truly know what he is but are helpless to do anything about it; that is unless they play the same game that Scottsdale himself plays in order to bring him to justice and prevent his accumulation of even more power so that he can do more unheard of damage. What happens is an adventure that will have them running for their very lives as they do what they can to stay out of a monster’s reach before they can bring him down. The only trouble is, will they live long enough to do it?",
