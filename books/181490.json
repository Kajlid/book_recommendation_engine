  "description": "Quinn Sawyer didn't apply for a temporary job at the remote O'Connor Adventure Retreat all the way in Alaska because he wants a change of scenery. He loves his sunny Florida, and he's only heading north because he needs answers from Declan O'Connor, the man who dated Quinn's aunt six years ago.One day, Declan was just gone, and it had been the beginning of hell for Quinn. Most of his family suddenly hated him and still blames him for Declan ending the relationship with Quinn's aunt, though nobody will tell Quinn why.He deserves to know how it could've possibly been his fault, and he's not going to let the crush he harbored for Declan stand in the way. After finally tracking down Declan, Quinn gets on a plane. Or death machine, as he prefers to call it. But in his quest to find out the truth, he discovers there's a lot more to the Land of the Midnight Sun than seeking answers.",
