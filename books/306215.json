  "description": "The sequel to Amber Allure's former #1 Best Seller Under My Skin...  Sebastian Keller's lived with the label \"the smart guy\" most of his life. He hasn't always appreciated it, and it certainly hasn't worked to his advantage in most romantic relationships--for years it seemed he was destined to attract the wrong type. So the last thing he'd wanted this past spring was to fall for the hunky tattoo artist who moved his shop in next door to Sebastian's thriving bookstore. Dylan Radamacher, owner of Rad Tattoos, was everything Sebastian loathed. Let's face it, bookish geeks and counterculture bad boys weren't made to mix. Something Sebastian knew from painful personal experience.  But when Dylan, with his teasing smile, hot, inked body, and come-hither voice, set his sights on Sebastian, determined to prove that some bad boys could be very, very good indeed, Sebastian found the man impossible to resist.  For two months things between them have been sinfully spectacular, and Sebastian hates to rock the boat. But the truth is, in spite of his own commitment issues, he's fallen in love with the sexy tattooist. Dylan, on the other hand, seems determined to avoid the \"L\" word at all costs. As their relationship shifts toward the serious side, can the guys overcome their fears and take the steps that will bring them the kind of love that lasts a lifetime? Or will their old baggage come back to haunt them and tear them apart for good?  Gay / Contemporary / Exhibitionism / Public Places / Series",
