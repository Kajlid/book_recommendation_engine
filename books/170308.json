  "description": "This Caldecott Honor classic is a simple yet important story about friendship. Two kids meet on a street. \"Yo!\" says one. \"Yes?\" says the other. And so begins a conversation that turns strangers into friends. With vibrant illustrations, Chris Raschka's rhythmic read-aloud is a celebration of differences -- and how it just takes a few words to overcome them. More relevant than ever in our divided world, this 1993 Caldecott Award-winning classic is presented in an accessible paperback format.",
