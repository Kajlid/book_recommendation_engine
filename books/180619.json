  "description": "The holy sacrament of Confirmation is considered Baptism for adults, a time when individuals proclaim their faith in God. So why does Tristan Adamson feel so much trepidation when his parents force him to take classes to be confirmed in the Catholic Church? Is it because he isn't sure if this is the right choice? Does he have more important concerns he needs to attend to, such as his grade in English class, or working at the Burger House? Or is it something much deeper that a chance encounter with someone at a party forces him to face? As Tristan sets out to answer these questions, he begins a journey of self-discovery that will force him to face the powers of Hell, and God, and nuns with rulers.",
