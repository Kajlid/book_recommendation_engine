  "description": "You’re never really out until you’re dead. That’s what the mob bosses, gunrunners and car thieves of Seattle will tell you, anyway. Zeth Mayfair, ex mafia enforcer, has other ideas. Since falling for Sloane, he’s managed to turn her life upside down. Now, he’s determined to give her a stable, happy and, most importantly, safe life. If that means he has to sleep with one eye open and one hand on a shotgun, then that’s what he’ll do. Mason Reeves is just looking for a way to take care of his sick sister. Since their mother left, things have been hard, and they’re only getting harder. Prescription meds don’t come cheap, and working as an auto mechanic only pays so well. If he wants to give Millie the life she deserves, he’s going to have to earn it with his fists. And who better to teach him how to fight than the guy who took down the biggest gangster in Seattle? You can try to get out… You can try to be good… You can steer clear of trouble… But it’s only a matter of time before trouble comes looking for you. *** Zeth and Sloane are back alongside a cast of new characters in the new Chaos & Ruin series *** Violent Things is Book 1 in this, the sister series to Blood & Roses. You can read this book if you haven't already read the Blood & Roses series! Upon delivery of the book, you will find an in-depth synopsis of the previous series, should you wish to jump straight into Violent Things but are yet to meet Zeth Mayfair & Sloane Romera. Of course, Violent Things will be more enjoyable if you start their journey from the very beginning.
