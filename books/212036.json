  "description": "It is Friday the thirteenth, and with the Norwegian capital enveloped in freezing cold, seventy-nine-year-old Reidar Folke Jesperson passes what will be the last day of his life. In the early hours of the following morning he is found stabbed to death in his shop, his naked body exposed in the shop's window, a red string tied round his neck, and three crosses and a number - 195 - written across his chest. Police officers Gunnarstranda and Frolich - the team who were so deeply embroiled in the search for The Fourth Man - are called to the scene. Questions of love and betrayal, loyalty and guilt consume the investigation, just as they fill the private lives of the investigators. What will be uncovered is a country where victims, perpetrators and even police officers are haunted by the past, still trying to cope with the dark memories of the Nazi occupation of the country.",
