I certainly don’t expect to run into him that same night after one too many tequila shots.Turns out that he’s kind of a big deal. Okay, fine, a really big deal. In fact, he might be the one person who can take my game to the next level.Convincing him to help will be difficult.Not throwing my club at his handsome face when he makes me work harder than I thought humanly possible will be excruciating.But not falling for him will be the hardest thing of all.",
