  "title": "A Slave For The Demon #1",
  "description": "A young slave woman from the mine pits, chosen as a sacrifice. A demon of insatiable lust. What will happen when he takes her as his own?    I did not know when I awoke that today would be unlike any day I'd ever known before. Today, I was picked for the Master and freed from the slave pits. I have been chosen as a sacrifice for a demon called forth from Hell. A demon of insatiable lust. A demon who demands utter obedience, inflicts pain, and takes whatever he wants. I will be all his, utterly and completely. I will pleasure him in every way I know how. I want him, more than I've ever wanted anything before.  This story features BDSM elements:  whips, chains, dominance and submission.  It also features  voyeurism , a demon with a very, very large.... appendage, and a pair of imps who like to join in on the action. Not to be read by the faint of heart.  This short story is 8000 words. It is the first part in the three-part series. It does not have a cliff-hanger ending and can be read stand-alone.",
