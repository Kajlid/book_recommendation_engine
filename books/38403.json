  "description": "This is a short novella and 18+ please. *Author Note:\"I received so many emails asking about the queen of Fae who appears in all my Legend books. So here she is--Aaibhe's backstory. This is a stand alone and it is a short story. If you have read the Legend series, you will enjoy and understand this better. I do so hope you enjoy and thanks so much for giving my Legend series a try. :) Claudy\" Seventy thousand years is a long time to live without true love.As queen of the Seelie Fae, Aaibhe led her people to a new world when their own had been destroyed by war. She accepted the responsibility of maintaining the magic-built walls that imprisoned the evil Dark Fae. She kept the Seelie Hallows safe. And though she enjoyed the companionship of an occasional Fae lover, she never took a royal Fae as her king or a non-royal as her consort.Conall is a Druid high priest from the MacTalbots, one of the families chosen by Aaibhe centuries before to perform the rituals needed to strengthen the Unseelie prison walls. Though a skilled and loyal Druid priest, he is but a mortal human, not a fit match for a powerful, formidable, immortal ruler.And yet… she wants him. In all her seventy thousand years, she has never been blasted with such desire—and need. She has never before laughed with total abandon, loved with all her essence.In Conall’s arms, Aaibhe discovers she can be both a queen and a woman, but jealousy, pride, and bitterness threaten the love that is at last within her grasp.Some people have asked me what Shee means. Shee is how Sidhe is pronounced and Sidhe means Fae...so Shee is Fae. :)",
