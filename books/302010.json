  "description": "Cristi Christensen's Chakra Rituals is a book that makes the ancient science of Chakras accessible to spiritually conscious women, and offers a seven-week step-by-step program.Learn how to tap into the single most perfect system living inside of each of us--the seven Chakras.While Chakras have become trendy, sexy, cool, and very spiritual, few people today really know how to activate the Chakras' powerful energy for deep transformation. Cristi Christensen aims to change that, and Chakra Rituals offers readers a multi-dimensional, practical, and inspiring structured seven-week step-by-step program. Each week, readers are instructed how to activate a different Chakra, and each weekday they are led through a dynamic, easy, and motivating practice (altar building; breathing; meditation; vinyasa yoga flow, mudra, writing contemplation, and embodiment) which distills the esoteric concepts and makes them tangible, living experiences. A self-discovery and self-help guide with striking full-color illustrations, Chakra Rituals employs the Chakras' potential to open the pathways to a full, enlightened \"aliveness.\" Seasoned practitioners and newcomers alike are invited to flow with their emotions, claim their power, transform their lives, and align with the divine.",
