  "title": "Skyfall",
  "description": "The second book of the Darklands Trilogy opens in Port City, a city built in a series of interconnected Skydomes - thousands of metres above the ground and linked to one another by a series of Magnetic lifts or 'maglifts'. This city stands above the ruins of an ancient city, possibly Perth on the West Coast of Australia. It is home to the race we know from book one as 'nightpeople' - the decendents of the Skypeople of old, who, a millennium earlier when faced with the deterioration of the natural world, built the city (along with several others around the globe) to protect themselves from increasing levels of solar radiation and a rapidly degenerating environment. The 'Skypeople' are an advanced race, something akin to current Western Civilization, who see themselves as the descendents of 'pure' humanity.",
