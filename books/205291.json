The story is set in an unnamed Italian city, where the Duke has recently died, leaving his corrupt and depraved son, Lussurioso, in charge. The play follows the story of Vindice, a young man seeking revenge against the Duke for the murder of his fianc�����e. Vindice takes on various disguises and personas in order to get close to the Duke and enact his revenge. Along the way, he encounters a cast of characters including the Duke's other sons, his scheming mistress, and a group of corrupt courtiers. The play is known for its dark and violent themes, as well as its use of satire and black comedy to comment on the corrupt nature of society and those in power. The Revenger's Tragedy is considered a classic of Jacobean drama and continues to be performed and studied today.VINDICI And therefore I'll put on that knave for once, And be a right man then, a man a' th' time, For to be honest is not to be i' th' world.
