  "title": "The Rubáiyát of a Persian Kitten",
  "description": "A humorous illustrated parody of Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat follows a mischievous Persian kitten on a series of escapades. While the original 1904 edition is considered highly collectible and can be pricey, there are a number of lower priced reprints available for cat lovers and poetry lovers. Herford (1863 - 1935) was an exceptional illustrator as well as humorist, and his drawings certainly give this book much of its charm.",
