  "description": "You probably won’t like Ethan Sinclair.Not because he planned to shoot up his high school, starting with the most popular kids of course.Not because he turns to mush when he falls in love with the beautiful new girl who takes him under her wing and makes him a man.Not even because he’s accused of her murder and only serves a few months of juvie.And no, you won’t even dislike Ethan when he changes his world and becomes somebody that nobody expected.This isn’t a story of romantic love where Ethan is transformed through the purest heart of a good woman.This is more of a cautionary tale about the kind of love that destroys a person, leaves them hollowed out. Empty.This is a story about the kind of love they’d do all over again, no matter how hard it broke them the first time.And that is why you will dislike Ethan Sinclair.Because he did it all over again.**************************************This is my original placeholder blurb :D : This boy meets a girl and does stuff and doesn't do other stuff and then things happen and he spends most of his adult life criss crossing two countries looking for women to murder in hideous ways. And then other stuff happens, you all hate me and send me angry emails for fucking your mind with my words and some people just outright hate me and hate my writing and stars are given and reviews are written and bingo bango art is produced, motherfuckers.",
