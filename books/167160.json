  "description": "Can love alone save the day? Award-winning author Linnea Sinclair returns with a vibrant interstellar thriller of romance and adventure in which two lovers are tested in the crucible of deep space. Before her court-martial, Captain Chasidah Chaz Bergren was the pride of the Sixth Fleet. Now she s a fugitive from the justice of a corrupt Empire. Along with her lover, the former monk, mercenary, and telepath Gabriel Ross Sullivan, Chaz hoped to leave the past light-years behind until the news of her brother Thad s arrest and upcoming execution for treason. It s a ploy by Sully s cousin Hayden Burke to force them out of hiding, and it works. With a killer targeting human females and a renegade gen lab breeding \"jukor\" war machines, Chaz and Sully already had their hands full of treachery, betrayal - not to mention each other. Throw in Chaz s Imperial ex-husband, Admiral Philip Guthrie, and a \"Kyi-Ragkiril\" mentor out to seduce Sully, and not just loyalties but lives are at stake. For when Sully makes a fateful choice, changing their relationship forever, Chaz must also choose between what duty demands and what her heart tells her she must do.",
