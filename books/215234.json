  "description": "\"Your problem is that your heart is too big, it leaves you vulnerable and makes you weak.\" He spoke in such certainty that it brought tears to my eyes, because it was the truth. I was vulnerable and delicate, I was weak and let my guard down too much. \"You put your heart on your sleeve. You are oblivious to evil and peoples capabilities because you cannot imagine a person like that, you are blinded by your good nature.\"  \"What about yours?\" I asked hesitantly, trying to keep the shake out of my voice. He looked at me with confusion for a second so I continued, \"What about your heart?\" I questioned. He looked at me with his dark eyes, his stare like stone. \"I haven't got one.\" ******* Angela and Adriano are like fire and ice, they are complete opposites. But what happens when Angela gets thrown into Adriano's dangerous lifestyle? Can Adriano protect her from the evils he faces every day? Or does it become too much for the innocent Angela to cope with?",
