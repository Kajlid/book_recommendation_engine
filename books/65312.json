  "description": "Myths and legends are more than just passing interests for Sonia Agostino. She holds degrees in folklore and anthropology, and she comes from a family of Keepers, humans charged with helping paranormal creatures survive in the modern world.Recently, her research—and her intuition—have led her to Chicago’s Inhibitions nightclub. Its enigmatic owner, known only as Damek, could be the one paranormal creature she has never seen. A vampire. Except he won’t see her.Damek has good reason to refuse an audience with Sonia. One look at her and his gut reaction is she’s a serious threat to the simple, highly disciplined routine that keeps his bloodlust in check. Worse, she has unwittingly led vampire hunters far too close for comfort.Yet when she stubbornly shows up at the nightclub a second time, he cannot refuse her. The force of their attraction explodes with erotic power—and danger. For when Sonia discovers that her suspicions were true, she finds her loyalties unexpectedly tested. And her choice will forever change both their lives.",
