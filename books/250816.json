  "title": "Pride & Surrender",
  "description": "I want no part of messy emotions, of lust and surrender. But none of that seems to matter to Christos Constantine. No matter how much I resist, no matter how much I fight, he keeps coming after me...and I am powerless. My pride and strength of will have always kept me safe. The armor I’ve built around me is impenetrable and no one is allowed to see beneath. I’ve kept Christos and the attraction that simmers between us at bay for two long years, but he’s done taking no for an answer. I don’t think I have the strength of will to resist, but I will not go down without a fight.",
