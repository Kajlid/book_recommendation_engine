  "description": "I thought I saw the worst of humanity in the war. I had no idea that the biggest threat to my family was lurking at home.  He destroyed my sister's will to live, so I destroyed him. I knew it meant I would have to run to the edge of the earth to escape my crime. Disappearing into the Canadian wilderness definitely fit the bill. I thought I'd found a perfect refuge from the law, from civilization and unfortunately, from women. I guess I was wrong about all three. She thinks she's tracking me. Hunting me. She doesn't know I'm on her trail. With her long, flowing hair and her thick, kissable lips, I couldn't turn away. It was too much for this wild man to resist. I should have hung low. Stayed away. But, he was going to steal her innocence. I kidnapped her to keep her safe, but when she looks at me with those big green eyes I know that's a promise I can’t keep. I want to be her first and last… I want to make her mine. To protect her from a monster like him, she needed a monster like me.
