  "description": "Living in a world where vampires can't stand the sight of shifters, and shifters gag at the smell of vamps, a vicious war rages -- and the vampires are winning. Clearly, this is not an ideal setting for a mixed-species shifter couple. Valerian is the Alpha of his pack, a fighter and an unemotional killer, but one whose skill has kept him alive. On one of his missions, among captured shifters, he finds the cougar Teddy, his mate. Things would be simpler if either of them actually wanted a mate, but on top of the fact that they don't, there is also the small issue of clashing personalities. Attacking is their first reaction -- sex is only for survivors.",
