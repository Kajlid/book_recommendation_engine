  "title": "Frisk",
  "description": "The author of Closer, “a story about how desire can persist to the brink of self-destruction and beyond” (Thomas Edwards, The New York Review of Books), takes a further step in his chilling exploration of sex and death. Possessed by the mystery of a series of fake snuff photographs he was shown as a teenager, “Dennis,” the narrator of Frisk, lives in a world where the rules of attraction have become a game of treasure hunt, and love is only a matching of images and body parts. In Holland, finally, in a room in a windmill above a brewery, Dennis is freed from the need to respect feelings; the unimaginable becomes an idea, and the idea a reality. Frisk is an unflinching and inexorable walk on the line between death and desire, where there is no retribution.",
