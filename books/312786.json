  "description": "The party was supposed to be the highlight of the summer. If only I’d known that night would destroy our lives…All the neighbours were laughing, drinking out of plastic glasses and getting along. I almost felt happy. Almost forgot about the terrible argument earlier and the sinister messages I’d been receiving from a strange address all week, threatening to expose the lies behind my perfect life.As we finished with the red and gold fireworks and welcomed everyone back to our house, I believed that everything would be okay.But I didn’t know who I was inviting in.I never could have imagined what would happen here, in our home, after I’d gone up to bed.Everyone saw something different.It’s my daughter’s word against the story the boy from down the road is telling. But how can I find out what really happened that night without everyone finding out the truth about me?",
