  "description": "Four of my best friends and I started a journey five years ago not knowing where it would take us. We built an empire from the bottom up and now we are successful businesswomen. But one thing has been missing: Love.  My name is Cinnamon Raye. I am the President and CEO of ScentSations and I am a Brad-a-holic.  Bradley O’Donnell has been an obsession of mine for over a year. Just when I have resigned myself to moving on from my unhealthy need for him, he surprises me with a confession of his own.  Will my humble beginnings prove too much of an obstacle for us? Or will it be my own insecurities that destroy my heart’s desire?  Brad says he can tear down my walls. I hope so.  Because the alternative is too painful to imagine.",
