  "description": "One terrible mistake cost Zev Oren his family, his place as pack alpha and his future. Living as a disgraced mercenary and beset by guilt, Zev is sure things can’t get much worse. Then he meets Simeon Kane, the omega assassin sent to kill him. Simeon’s presence wakes a passion Zev tried to bury years ago, but that passion could keep Zev from ever returning home. Because in order to do so he must regain his honor, clean up his act and deny he’s gay. Simeon wants to complete his mission, assassinate his mark and move on. Emotions aren’t a part of the job, and he’d like to keep it that way. When he’s sent to kill the sexy alpha with the lopsided grin, Simeon can’t pull the trigger. Zev is too vibrant and handsome and. . . married. But he makes Simeon feel alive. The fiery lust and strange sensations rising between them is more than simple desire – it’s the mark of true mates. While fighting assassins, hunters and a murderous warlord is easy – falling in love isn’t. Can Zev and Simeon repair their shattered souls and give in to the bond set by fate?",
