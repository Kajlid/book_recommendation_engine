  "description": "Sometimes the Best Bond for a Job is a Jane ... Jane Bond.\"What's the story on Bond?\"\"Your man is a homicidal depressive paranoiac,\" the doctor reported.\"I know that. I want to know what's wrong with him!And be straight with me, man. No medical mumbo jumbo.\"\"He's lost his nerve.\" N. had suspected as much. After a long while spent staring at the jagged skyline of London, N. came to a decision. He had no other choice but to go through with Pumpernickel's ridiculous plan. Enter Bond, Jane Bond, James's lesbian twin sister and haoless bookstore employee, who steps in to masquerade as her brother at an awards ceremony with the queen. But when the dastardly Sons of Britain (S.O.B.s), a nefarious fraternity plotting to bring the Duke and Duchess of Windsor back to power, show up, it's up to some unexpected heros to save the day. The Powder Puff Girls -- makeup salespersons by day, secret agents by night -- step in to secure the future of Britain while Jane keeps her brother's reputation intact...both in and out of the bedroom!",
