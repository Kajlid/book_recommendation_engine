  "title": "Sin with the Sleeping Choir Girl 2: Mary",
  "description": "Mary's parents said that they didn't know where they went wrong. Their sweet choir girl daughter had been staying out late, hanging out with boys, and her parents even suggest that she'd been drinking! They asked me to talk to her as her trusted spiritual advisor. Unfortunately for Mary, when I saw her in her flowery dress, I knew that it would take me all night to minister the good word to her. One thing was for sure, though: This inexperienced girl would soon be bearing the fruit of the Lord's love!",
