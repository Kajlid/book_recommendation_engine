  "description": "In Lisa Mannetti’s wonderfully disturbing novella, THE BOX JUMPER, we meet Leona Derwatt, Houdini’s assistant on and off stage, and one of his mistresses. Houdini not only takes her into his confidence, teaching her the intricacies of his magic, but teams with her as they confront and expose fraudulent psychics and mediums of their day. The tension in the story (based on Mannetti’s thorough research) involves Houdini’s conflicts with fake mediums (who may have been complicit in his death) and Leona’s continued run ins with the same phoney psychics later in her life.“‘Magic’ is the operative word for this moody novella. The magic of Harry Houdini serves as an overriding backdrop here, but another kind of magic permeates these pages—the magic of fine writing. Don’t expect the usual linear plot, because there is no direct narrative. Vivid dreams, surreal images, hypnotic memories, all serve to flesh out an unsettling tale that sweeps us into a new fictional dimension. Read The Box Jumper and share the magic.”— William F. Nolan, author of Logan’s Run and screenwriter of Burnt Offerings “In Lisa Mannetti’s magical The Box Jumper, readers are treated to intriguing premises and finely wrought characterizations rooted in the hazy past of a bygone America. As usual, Mannetti’s driving narrative propels this fascinating portrait of illusionist Harry Houdini and the strange goings on in and around—even beyond—his world. Highly recommended to all who love a great story, excellent writing, and memorable characters with a haunting literary flair.”— Jason V. Brock, author of Milton’s Children and Disorders of Magnitude",
