  "description": "The bestselling author of Ghost World collects his acclaimed short stories from Eightball and Esquire. The dramatic short stories included in Caricature have drawn comparisons to Nabokov for their complex naturalism and sense of humor. Anchored by the title story, considered the first apotheosis of Clowes' seminal Eightball underground comic book series, Caricature also includes eight other stories, including \"Green Eyeliner,\" a six-page full-color short story originally published in Esquire as the first work of comics to be featured in the magazine's fiction issue (and commissioned by then-editor Dave Eggers). Also included are: a rare fully-painted short, \"MCMLXVI,\" the full-color \"Gold Mommy,\" \"Glue Destiny,\" \"Gynecology,\" \"Immortal, Invisible,\" \"Blue Italian Shit,\" \"Like a Weed, Joe,\" \"Black Satin,\" an all-new cover, and more. Color and black-and-white comics throughout",
