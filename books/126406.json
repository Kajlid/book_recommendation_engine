  "title": "The Asylum",
  "description": "Nightmares, tales of haunting, and legends are often based on history. In most cases bits of fact are wildly exaggerated for maximum scare potential. Unfortunately for patients in 19th century asylums their reality was far worse than anyone can imagine. Condemned to a hell masqueraded as treatment, these patients suffered despair and pain greater than any human limit can measure.The Asylum re-visits some of these institutions and takes its readers down a road in history that will never be forgotten.",
