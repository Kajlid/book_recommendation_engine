  "description": "At one thousand years old, Simon Sorellion is feeling strange. The house demon has been content to coexist quietly with humans. Now, he's met one that he'd like to taste.  Tom is a sullen, college-age witch who's studying magic in his Aunt Lucinda's creepy house all summer. He'd rather escape back to the city, by any means necessary. Maybe that means cutting a deal with the demon who wants to get friendly. Intimate, even.  Tom really should know better.  Simon has never been with a human before — hell, he doesn't even have a physical body — but none of that will stop him from getting what he wants.  What readers are saying: \"I adore the filth you wrote!\" - Austin Chant (Peter Darling, Caroline's Heart)",
