  "title": "The Secrets of Modern Medicine Revealed",
  "description": "This book titled \"Secrets of Modern Medicine- Revealed\" is an attempt to show a regular person the world of medicine as seen from the eye of the doctor. Books of this nature are very difficult to find because most doctors assume that without a basic medical knowledge, people will not be able to understand how modern medicine works. Most of the medical books that are written for the general readers so far only offer some form of medical advice or opinion. The few books that attempt to give the readers a doctor's view of medicine are mostly personal stories rather than factual information. This book is different in that it does not give you any medical advice but tells you how modern clinical medicine works. It explains to you in a simple factual manner how doctors process the information obtained from your blood tests and what goes through the doctors' mind when they ask you a particular question. It tells you what the doctor is listening for when he puts the stethoscope in your chest. It gives you interesting facts about what doctors learn in medical school and what they learn outside the medical school. It tells you how medical students and doctors at different stages of their training interact with each other and how that might influence your hospital experience. It explains to you about why they do screening tests for certain diseases and not for others. It explains to you what it means when the media reports the findings of a new drug research. In summary, it gives you the little secrets that are taken for granted in the medical profession but would be surprising and exciting to the outsiders.",
