Winter Bennett is on the worst date of her life, so she decides to bail and go home to her true loves: take out and Netflix. On her way out of the door, she spots her ex-boyfriend with his hot, new girl. Horrified at the thought of being seen, Winter does what any sane woman would do; she bolts into the bathroom and out the back window.  Falling smack-dab in the middle of a sting operation wasn't part of the plan, but that’s exactly what happened. And now, bullets are flying overhead. Thankfully, a sexy NYPD homicide detective by the name of Wyatt Hunter saves her. He is furious with her for ruining his operation but he's even more upset when he can’t get her off his mind. Soon he falls for her — hard. Unfortunately, Winter's heart has been broken and she's too afraid to let anyone in. Does Wyatt have what it takes to get Winter to give love one more try?   This steamy romance is a roller coaster ride that will make you hot, make you laugh, and even shed a few tears. It's a full-length standalone novel. NO cheating, NO cliffhangers, and a guaranteed Happily-ever-after! This book has adult content for ages 18 and over.",
