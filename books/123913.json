In the summer between his high school graduation and his admittance into, he delves into his first foray with love—and comes out the other side burned. Yet he presses on, meeting Quentin…and Cathy…and Anna Lina…But it’s not until one night when he locks eyes with Chloe, that his world stops.Things are immediately easy with Chloe, and they fall into each other’s arms and each other’s lives. But where Chris is immediately smitten with tender love for Chloe, she guards her emotions, holding herself back from saying “yes” to his love. As time and distance separate the two, Chris must determine if Chloe is worth pursuing, and if he’ll ever get her “yes.”Sweet, tender, and nostalgic, Tim Hunniecutt’s coming-of-age romance story Getting to Yes is an ode to young love and commitment, and is not to be missed.",
