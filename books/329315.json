  "description": "I came home from war with a fistful of medals and a limp.\n\nDidn’t expect to find an angel sunbathing on my deck.\n\nThis lakehouse was left to me by the best guy I ever knew, but I don’t think he meant to leave me his little sister too.She can have the cabin. I’m not a monster–I won’t kick her out, but I won’t leave her in a ruin either.Because it’s a project. A fixer-upper. It’s no good for her to stay here with no hot water and holes in the walls, and when I think about her lying cold in her bed at night, I could howl.So I’ll fix her lakehouse. I’ll pay my respects to her brother.And I swear on every last medal I brought home–I will keep my hands off the sweet, lost girl.\nThe Heart of the Wounded Hero series was created to pay tribute to and raise awareness of wounded heroes. Each of the over eighty authors involved have contributed time, money, and stories to the cause.\n\nThese love stories are inspiring and uplifting, showing the sacrifice of our veterans but also giving them the happily ever after they deserve. By increasing awareness through our books, we believe we can in a small part help the wounded heroes that have sacrificed so much. Thank you for reading.",
