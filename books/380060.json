Suddenly a change in personality occurs in Kitty's soon to be model husband-a change so striking as to jeopardize not just the Darcys' social standing, but their lives as well.A mysterious mirror, an insidious reprobate from the past, and matters far beyond the social circles around Pemberly all come into play in a dangerous puzzle, where the consequences may be the exchange of a soul for a soul.Once again the Darcys take center stage as the Regency era's answer to The Thin Man 's Nick and Nora, searching for truth between tea times, amid the social whirl of Jane Austen's England.",
