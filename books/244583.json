  "description": "In 1920s Munich, homicide detective Axel Berg is called to the scene of a grisly homicide, the victim being a young and pretty society wife. Soon, a second body is uncovered; the discovery of a third indicates that Berg is dealing with an unimaginably evil killer. In the Germany of the time, the investigation cannot be straightforward. Adolph Hitler's power is growing, and the Nazis are a strong civic force in the city of Munich. Berg has always considered himself apolitical, and as an outsider living a routine life he's been of no interest to those with power. But this high-profile case changes all that, as senior officers work to their own agendas, while one theory is that the killings themselves are part of a fascist conspiracy. Berg is alone as never before, with the imminent threat at all times of making a mistake with deadly consequences.",
