  "description": "My high school crush, my older brother’s best friend. Now Cass is back to crash my summer alone.ShawnWhen I was a kid, I had the biggest crush on Cass.He was broody, with these beautiful eyes. A troublemaker who was infinitely cooler than I would ever be.Ten years later, I definitely didn’t expect to see him standing at the front door of my family’s house in the Kentucky woods, tatted up and even hotter.I was supposed to have the summer to myself and my geeky astronomy project, but my brother hired his old friend to do a massive carpentry project on the house.Just because Cass is straight doesn’t make it any easier to keep my eyes off him.He was always the man I wanted. I just never dared believe a couple opposites like us could attract.",
