But will her feelings be reciprocated?Something in CommonNerd and amateur photographer Justine is partaking of one of her favourite pastimes—visiting a historical site—when she bumps into Amber. It turns out they're both equally enthusiastic about exploring stately homes, abbeys, stone circles and the like—and their surprise at meeting someone with similar interests leads them on another adventure together, which doesn't end at the site.Little Miss Goody Two ShoesIzzy and her girlfriend are visiting a beautiful stately home in the British countryside. Taking a stroll around the garden, Izzy's shocked to see a statue of a female—totally naked. Her girlfriend, astounded that Izzy is such a prude and a Little Miss Goody Two Shoes, proceeds to show her just what fun can be had in a country garden with a statue to hide them from prying eyes.",
