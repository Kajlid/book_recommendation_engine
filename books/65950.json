  "title": "The Last Summer",
  "description": "For a small Georgia town in 1955, things aren't always what they seem. Charlotte \"Charley\" Mason is viewed as your average weirdo tomboy by pretty much everybody - except her best friends, eight boys who play on a summer-long baseball team. In her team, she's viewed as an equal, unlike her home and school life. If she isn't being taunted by the Pretty Posse or Biff Richardson's gang, then she has her mother pressuring her to be a perfect little lady. These past years have made her tougher and stronger, especially with her two best friends, Frankie and Arthur, by her side. And then of course there's her Grandpa, who once was a professional baseball player for the Yankees, who passed on his passion of the game to her. He gave her the beloved signature Yankees baseball cap that she always wears. So you can imagine she's ready for a summer to remember...the only thing standing in her way is the sudden, out-of-the-blue fact that she is moving to New York on August first. She realizes she has one shot at making her last summer in Valia Springs worth while.",
