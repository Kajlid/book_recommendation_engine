  "description": "A picture book from author-illustrator Jared Chapman, “ Vegetables in underwear ? Guaranteed preschool hilarity . . . Expect second, third, and more helpings of this scantily clad harvest” ( Horn Book magazine).A bunch of friendly vegetables wear colorful underwear of all varieties—big, small, clean, dirty, serious, and funny—demonstrating for young ones the silliness and necessity of this item of clothing. The unexpectedness of vegetables in their unmentionables is enough to draw giggles, but the pride with which the “big kid” attire is flaunted in front of the baby carrots in diapers will tickle readers of all ages.With rhyming text that begs to be chanted aloud and art that looks good enough to eat, this vibrant story will encourage preschoolers to celebrate having left those diapers behind!Vegetables in Underwear Vegetables in UnderwearVegetables in Holiday UnderwearVegetables in PajamasVegetables in Halloween CostumesAlso available from Jared Fruits in Suits",
