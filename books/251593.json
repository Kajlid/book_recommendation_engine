  "description": "We are living during times of bullying, abuse, and people purposely trying to ruin the lives of those that are trying to do good. You have people making themselves feel good by killing people that do not have anything to do with their mental illness. It has come to a point where killing or hurting people is easy than spreading love and decency. God made everyone beautiful is poetically correct and expedient for there are so many people assimilated into our society that need someone to make them feel happy, loved and beautiful. I wrote this book, because of no matter your past mistakes, looks or economic situations, you are beautiful! Now go and tell someone they are beautiful, and you will discover that will also make you feel beautiful.https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/raymondst...",
