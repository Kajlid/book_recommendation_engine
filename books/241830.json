  "description": "Maya and Una are typical twenty-somethings living in Zagreb, Croatia: they have a ton of friends, spend their days at thankless jobs, their nights dancing and drinking with friends, and going home to their cramped apartments. They meet plenty of men, but none who can really capture these flirty girls’ attention. When they’re invited on a trip to Brussels by the same man, they jump at the offer. Soon they find themselves in the middle of a bachelor party, wondering why they were even invited. Luckily there’s a wedding, and some familiar guests, who just might make the trip worthwhile.",
