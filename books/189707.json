  "description": "Newlyweds Coon and Grace have just returned from a blissful, romantic honeymoon and are settling into the routine of daily married life. Unfortunately, the transition isn’t nearly as smooth as they’d hoped, and is disrupted by conflict and disagreement.As tensions mount and tempers flare, a gracious presence intervenes and throws the pair together for a day with four older couples who’ve weathered many storms. Not only have these couples survived, they’ve also learned how to thrive both in life and in marriage. Having experienced virtually every stressor a relationship can face, this wildly diverse group, led by a colorful rural sheriff, openly shares their vast experiences and how they successfully overcame each obstacle.Despite their diversity, one common theme that runs through each veteran’s story is the presence of a mysterious person known only as “the shepherd.” As the day unfolds, Coon and Grace learn the shepherd’s approach to life, which allows them to arrange the pieces of their lives into something more beautiful than they could ever have possibly imagined.Lighthearted yet inspirational, Jigsaw is a powerful parable wrapped in a novel with complex characters that teaches the “how” of both marriage and life.",
