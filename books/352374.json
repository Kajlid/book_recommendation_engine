  "title": "Finding Serenity: Anti-Heroes, Lost Shepherds and Space Hookers in Joss Whedon's Firefly",
  "description": "Firefly’s early demise left fans with a deep sense of loss and plenty of unanswered questions. From what was wrong with the pilot to what was right with the Reavers, from the use of Chinese to how correspondence between Joss and network executives might have gone, from a philosopher’s perspective on “Objects in Space” to a sex therapist’s analysis of Inara, Finding Serenity is filled with writing as exciting, funny and enthralling as the show itself.Contents:• Introduction / Jane Espenson• The Reward, the Details, the Devils, the Due / Larry Dixon• The Heirs of Sawney Beane / Lawrence Watt-Evans• Asian Objects in Space / Leigh Adams Wright• The Rise and Fall (and Rise) of Firefly / Glenn Yeffeth• Who Killed Firefly? / Ginjer Buchanan• The Train Job Didn't Do the Job / Keith R.A.
