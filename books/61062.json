  "description": "Twenty-two year old Nicole Masters never expected to be engaged to Red Jameson, the business mogul and celebrity who owns the company where she works as an intern.But now she's got to deal with much more than simply pleasing Red in the bedroom (a full-time job in and of itself).Someone leaks the story of their relationship to the tabloids, and soon Nicole is dealing with angry stares from jealous co-workers, cruel stories written about her online, and a creepy stranger who seems to know more about Red's personal life than she does.On top of that, Red's unpredictable moods and his secretiveness are beginning to take their toll on Nicole's trusting nature.With so much working against them, can Nicole find a way to keep her relationship with Red intact, or will the high-pressure world that Red lives in eventually drive them apart?For His Taking (For His Pleasure, Book 2) is a 35,000 word tale of lust, submission, power and ultimately--a love story for the ages.",
