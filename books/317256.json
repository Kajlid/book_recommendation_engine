  "description": "Two sick-minded guys meet online and fall in love. It's the kinky, dirty stuff that keeps their lust-fuelled relationship going, especially the fact that they look so alike that they could be brothers, easing them into some pseudo-incest role-play.Until now, they've always been apart, but today's the day they meet in person for the first time. Will that same lust-fuelled love still be there? Will they slip as easily into their taboo kinks in person as they do online?They rent a hotel room and give in to all their dirtiest fantasies. It clicks. Everything clicks. It's even hotter in person than it is online. So much so that they consider a fast-forward move to make things permanent. After all, their in-person incestuous role-play and brotherly bond create a whole new kind of instalove...Naked bodies included.",
