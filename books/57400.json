  "description": "Django “Jake” Shepherd has finally arrived at the bottom. Once a chart-topping songwriter hanging out with stars, these days he’s working the bar at Jezebel’s, the wildest and most notorious gentlemen’s club in Nashville. Haunted by demons both past and present, yet stubbornly clinging to the faint hope of a comeback, Jake’s life is about to take an abrupt turn, launching him on a brutal and poetic journey of violence, sex, and murder that will take him from the underbelly of Music City to the stately mansions of Atlanta and beyond, barreling on at full-tilt boogie to the music of Jake’s impending dance with Death.",
