  "description": "Adam: Adam’s dark urges have been lying dormant inside him for a long time. A wrong move might ignite the fire in him and burn the whole town to the ground. And when Bailey entered through the doors looking like an angel, he knew he wanted to corrupt every piece of good inside of her. But every action has a consequence and what started as a game, quickly spiraled out of control.  Bailey: When Bailey moved to Pacific Heights with her parents, nobody could have warned her of what was to come. It was supposed to be a new beginning. A new life. But the problem with new beginnings is that they eventually come to an end. Maybe she should’ve listened when he said he would destroy her.  There's a strange house next door that hides several dark secrets. But secrets come with a price. And that price might be everyone’s lives. Evil lurks in every corner and no one is safe anymore. But sometimes the world doesn't need a hero. Sometimes, it needs a monster.  “Do you think I would hurt you, Bailey?” “I think you’d rip me to shreds.”  This is a stand-alone dark romance.",
