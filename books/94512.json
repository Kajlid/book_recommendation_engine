  "description": "WEST is a short Novella, told completely from West's point of view, during the first book in the Roam Series.I tried to resist her. She was smarter this time.Naive. Needing. Nothing good could come of this, of her in my arms again, her breath on my lips, her body beneath me. I knew what I needed to do. I knew what I had to do. Everything would be different this time, this seventh life, this last chance. I had a path... a remedy... a plan.Until the moment I touched her again.",
