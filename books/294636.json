  "description": "This is Book 2 of a three-part SERIES and NOT a standalone.Milo:“There is nothing worse in this life than being in love with someone who doesn’t love you back. This is what I am when I am around her. Her hero when she accepts me. Her biggest nightmare when she rejects me. I have come to that conclusion. I can’t fight it. I can’t explain it to her because I could never explain it to myself either.”  Raven: “The truth is, I have always been slow to react. I don’t lash out because I need time to analyze things at my own speed. People perceive that as me being logical and mature; wise beyond my age. I am not. I am indecisive and emotional. I just don’t show it. I have flaws. Lots of them. Like every human being, I am allowed to have them. I don’t want to cover them up as anything else.” WARNINGS: This is a DARK romance, that contains triggers such as dubious consent, non-consent, virus outbreak, mental health issues, and suicide. Some readers might find offensive. This is only a work of fiction intended for a mature, 18+ audience only. The author does not condone the behavior depicted.",
