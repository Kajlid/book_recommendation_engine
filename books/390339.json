  "description": "Torn between his frustrated artistic idealism and his contempt for the world of the senses, Harry Haller is a lonely, disconnected man. Then, through contact with a woman in a club called the Magic Theater, he learns that peace lies in reconciling the two warring sides of his psyche. An experimental mix of symbolism, realism and fantasy, this affecting story embodies Hesse's most personally felt theme--the wrenching conflict between the flesh and the spirit.",
