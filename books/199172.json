  "description": "Red Maine’s blue-collared bad boy, North Underwood, has a dirty little secret—Will Tanner.Friends since kindergarten, North had been the one to jump first, and his fall into Will’s bed ten years ago had been no exception. Will and North had been inseparable, but things change, people grow apart, and even a blazing flame can dwindle to a dying ember over time.The more things change the more they stay the same.After a run in with a bottle of Bundy rum, Will and North find themselves in a compromising and all too familiar position.Blurred lines, bad decisions, and one wrong foot after another lead these two down a spiral of sarcasm, secrets, and sex, but when North’s hetero status is called into question he can’t figure up from down. And despite Will telling himself he wouldn’t fall again, he’s head over heels and wandering without a compass.Love is love.Love is truth.Love … shouldn’t be this damn hard to figure out.",
