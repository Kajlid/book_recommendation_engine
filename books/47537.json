  "description": "The headlines scream Mina Borsalina Flips Out!, but she’s just horribly misunderstood.So she had a little meltdown that went viral on YouTube. Being barred from the set of her hit comedy sketch show Viva Friday! is completely unwarranted. That her wife then filed for divorce has been blown out of all proportion by the tabloids. Being financially strapped in high society Hollywood doesn’t look good, though. Going home to Landon, Iowa, is the perfect solution. Her twin sister, Tina, agrees to take her in only after Mina says she’ll teach music at her school while Tina focuses on serious health issues.Mina has never been fond of tykes and pageants, but how hard can it be? Landon, however, has fallen on hard economic times with high unemployment and too many people in line at the soup kitchen.Mina is about to get an education in what matters in life, but only time will tell if it’s soon enough to save the things that truly matter to her.",
