  "description": "He’s ready for more…Sole Regret’s sex-obsessed bassist Owen Mitchell has always rocked with the ladies and rolled with the punches. He knows Caitlyn’s just looking for a fling with someone more fun and adventurous than her ex-husband, but Owen is drawn to the geeky temptress like a rocker’s drawn to a heavy riff. He’ll keep thrilling her in the bedroom to keep her coming and coming back for more. He has faith that someday she’ll admit that they’re meant to be together.She’s not sure where this is going…Successful in life but not in love, Caitlyn isn’t ready for a serious relationship so soon after her painful divorce. But she’s more than ready for a good time. So she writes out a long list of sexual fantasies and knows just the rock star to fulfill them all. Owen, as always, is eager to please, and the more time they spend together, the more she starts to think he’s good for much more than ticking fantasies off her list. Now if only that pregnant groupie of his would get lost.",
