  "description": "This isn’t the first time amateur sleuth Sophie Katz has come face-to-face with a corpse—and now she’s in danger of becoming one herself. With Christmas right around the corner, Sophie’s sister is organizing a Swan Lake flash mob for a tech mogul’s elaborate holiday marriage proposal. But when the prima ballerina turns up dead, Sophie and her sister become prime suspects in the murder, not to mention suspects in the theft of a massive diamond ring. Now Sophie has just twenty-four hours to find out who really killed the Swan Princess or risk losing her sister, her life...or maybe both.",
