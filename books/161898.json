  "description": "Billy Mumberson is an ordinary eleven-year-old whose mother left the family a year ago, saying it was for Billy’s safety. Billy and his dad manage as best they can until one day a curious incident at the barbershop causes Billy to think his life may not be so ordinary after all. That evening a man and a woman appear at the front door insisting that the Mumberson house belongs to them. Next day Billy is kidnapped by two men in the Factory where his father works, and they try to take some of his blood. Billy is only just rescued by his good friend, Olivia. He soon learns that his blood has a hidden secret, that his missing mother may be more than an ‘ordinary mum’, and that the strange women who run the Factory may be more than just everyday businesswomen.The Mumbersons and The Blood Secret is a sequel to Mike Crowl's Grimhilda! which was published in January 2014. Those who read the earlier book will recognise the Mumbersons, but many of the other characters are new.",
