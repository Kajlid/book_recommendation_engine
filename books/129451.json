  "description": "Dalton Teban and his team gather again for the second round of the Guardian Tournament, and the five are far more eager to learn about their enemy than to win the tournament. However, a few of the members learn of secrets that the older members have kept, breeding distrust and confusion among the five Guardians. Meanwhile, their foe is finally ready to come out of the shadows and introduce himself to the Guardians as the notoriously powerful demon, Lord Yokouro DeVastes. While the revelation of their enemy is frightening enough, the Guardians soon learn that there are far bigger dangers that follow Yokouro, and cause the Guardians to question their ability to survive what has already proven to be the most dangerous assignment they have ever been given. Pulled into a world of unclear intentions and strange tests, the Guardian team tries to blindly figure out how to keep the ones they love, and themselves, safe from one of the most powerful beings in existence.",
