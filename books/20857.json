  "title": "A Window on Africa: Ethiopian Portraits",
  "description": "“My little red window has become almost a mirror image of the startling changes taking place today in Africa, where so many conflicts have arisen from the coming together of different peoples, creating a chaotic jumble of humanity that obliges vastly different cultures and languages to bond together to form some kind of community. My window has captured a moment in time, nothing more, nothing less, and in its endless stream of faces we can see the diversity of humankind, its customs and its religions, in a place that the old world now has to share with the new, with strangers who are here to stay.” —Hans SilvesterThe village of Kibish lies in the lower Omo Valley on the borders of Ethiopia, Kenya, and Sudan. Far from any city and with an unforgiving climate, it is nonetheless a place where traditional lifestyles meet the contemporary world. This book is a beguiling portrait of its people, seen through an unusual lens—that of a simple window frame. From painted, marked, and scarified tribesmen to tradesmen with their tools and farmers with their animals, this collection is a priceless record of a unique and increasingly fragile way of life, one threatened by conflict, tourism, and the rapidly encroaching twenty-first century.",
