  "title": "The Brotherhood",
  "description": "One dead cop, one small island, and an impact that will last a lifetime When Sergeant John White, mentor, savior, and all-round good guy, is murdered during a routine call-out, the tight-knit world of Tasmania Police is rocked to the core. An already difficult investigation into the death of one of their own becomes steeped in political complexities when the main suspect is identified as Aboriginal, and the case, courtesy of the ever-hostile local media, looks set to make Palm Island resemble a Sunday afternoon picnic in comparison. And as the investigation unfolds through the eyes of the sergeant's colleagues, friends, family, enemies, and the suspect himself, it becomes clear that there was a great deal more to John White—and the squeaky-clean reputation of the nation's smallest police service—than ever met the eye. The Brotherhood is a novel about violence, preconceptions, loyalties, corruption, betrayal, and the question a copper should never need to just who can you trust?",
