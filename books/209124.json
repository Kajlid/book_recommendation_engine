  "description": "Nikolai Vassago has a plan.His day starts out fairly normal. Get up, kick some ass, fondle his beard, take some names.One second he’s participating in a normal every day mission, and the next he’s saving the one woman that fate has promised him for the rest of his life from the grips of a criminal mastermind.Nikolai can’t say he’s altogether displeased with what he’s given, though. Not with that gorgeous brunette that would soon be warming his bed.The same can’t be said for Brooklyn.Living in a commune most of her life meant she wasn’t exposed to all of life’s craziness. The moment she turned eighteen, she was off and running, experiencing all of what life had to give.That means she sometimes jumps in feet first, not thinking about consequences until the deed is already done.Nikolai rescues her from a fate worse than hell, throwing her on the back of his dragon and flying off into the night.He’s a go-with-the-flow kind of man. Brooklyn, however, is not.Having been caged for the first eighteen years of her life, she wants nothing more than to be free to do what she pleases, consequences be damned.Nikolai, however, has different ideas, and he’s not above using his masculine will to prove to her that she’s exactly where she needs to be.",
