  "description": "In the dark night, the wolves howl, telling stories of the downfall of humanity and the last remnants of civilization. With their only natural predators gone—either dead or withering away from the disease that triggered the apocalypse—old Mansi’s wolf pack should be thriving. Yet food is scarce in this new world and, on the elderly wolf’s advice, the Alpha turns the pack south, toward a town rumored to be long abandoned…and perhaps their only hope for survival.But Mansi has other motives for venturing back toward civilization. Elsewhere, she hopes, she’ll find her mother, a human who once took care of her all those years ago, back when she was just a pup. Because all she truly wants is to return home, close her eyes by the side of her human, and leave the world at peace.Little does she know, the not-so-abandoned town harbors secrets, and a threat that will change the fate of her pack forever.Wolf Town is a post-apocalyptic adventure that blends both genre and expectations in a short story full of action, suspense, and undeniable heart. Readers call Wolf Town “engaging,” “distinct and memorable” and “anthropomorphic animals finally done right.”",
