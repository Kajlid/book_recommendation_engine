  "description": "Book updated 5/6/2020My name is Claudia, but it wasn’t always. Eleven years ago, my life changed. My best friend became my number one fear, and I knew staying was not an option.  After ten years of being on the run, it looks like he has forgotten about me. No longer do I feel like I need to hide, and for the first time in years, I am trying to live a normal life.  I was wrong though, so very wrong. My past has found me, and the lies I wove to protect myself have started to unravel.  I’m now faced with the same choices I had all those years ago. Do I stay to fight the past that haunts me; or do I run again, because running is what I’m good at?  The countdown has started. My window of opportunity is closing fast.
