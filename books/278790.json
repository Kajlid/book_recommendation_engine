  "title": "With the Kama Sutra Under My Arm: My Madcap Misadventures Across India",
  "description": "What do you do when your boyfriend dumps you and you’re nursing a broken heart? For Trisha Bernard, the answer’s clear: escape to India, armed with a copy of the Kama Sutra. That way you’ll be ready should love (or lust) strike.But, as Bernard explains in her uproarious account of that madcap adventure, not everything goes quite as planned. At the last minute, she’s joined by her long-lost friend Sally—an eccentric shopaholic who travels with a jam-packed monster suitcase. Then, there’s India itself, where the two women end up almost marooned in the Thar Desert, practically camel-napped in Rajasthan, and attacked by an amorous monkey in Delhi. And that’s just the beginning.…With her ardor for architecture and history, and her Kama Sutra to inspire passion, Trisha Bernard leads us on a wacky, witty, and wonderful romp through one of the world’s most fascinating cultures.",
