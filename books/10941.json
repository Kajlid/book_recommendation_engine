  "title": "Bess of Hardwick 1527-1608: A Material Girl",
  "description": "With the spirit of an adventuress and the heart of a shopkeeper, Bess set out to leave her mark on 16th-century England...A Derbyshire squire's daughter, she rose, via four well-chosen husbands, to become the second richest woman after Queen Elizabeth I. This is a story about mergers and acquisitions. It is also the story of one woman's quest - emerging triumphant from the wreckage of her final marriage - to build the most beautiful house in the country. In this sparkling biography, Kate Hubbard weaves the tale of Bess's life into the construction of Hardwick Hall itself, revealing it to be not just a work of architectural genius, but the expression of a towering, intractable personality.",
