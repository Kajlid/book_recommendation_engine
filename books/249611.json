  "description": "What happens when life in a perfect, protected bubble unravels? Juno is about to find out.Your ordinary teen? Not quite! Because Juno lives — in the not-too-distant future — on Taris, a bubble-covered island in the Pacific, to which a select few hundred people were evacuated when Earth's inhabitants took everything just a bit too far and began to self-destruct. On Taris there are many rules governing appearance, behaviour, even procreation ... but all are for the good of the community, to ensure the survival of humankind. Or are they?As Taris' protected environment begins to break down and Juno's questioning nature takes hold, she uncovers some startling inconsistencies in many of the 'factual' histories she has grown up with. She also begins to develop some quite startling, almost supernatural, abilities. As Juno faces increasing danger, she finds allies in the most surprising places.Juno of Taris is the first novel in an exciting YA fantasy series.",
