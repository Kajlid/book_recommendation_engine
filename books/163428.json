He has given up hope of finding a Dom or even a nonkink partner to love him. When his best friend practically forces him to attend a dinner party, the last thing he expects is a strong Dom who can see beyond his wheels.Deacon James is an architect and a demanding Dom, but he has spent the past couple of years without a sub or partner. When an employee invites him to a dinner party to meet his girlfriend, Deacon smells a setup but agrees anyway. He prides himself on being an excellent judge of character, and when he meets the younger dentist, he sees past the chair and finds a sweet submissive man who more than piques his interest.Kade's fears and demons continue to haunt him, challenging Deacon to use everything he's learned as a Dom to earn Kadeâ€™s trust and submission. Deacon's determined, though, willing to battle all of it to have Kade by his side and at his feet.",
