  "description": "Second Edition 2013While cleaning out the drawers of her recently deceased grandmother’s dresser, Anna Kippling finds a skeleton key that ironically only opens one door and from the wrong side. On the other side, instead of the small staircase leading down to the second floor, Anna finds another world awaiting her, a world her grandmother calls Tatania among other strange entries written inside a journal Anna finds inside an old steamer trunk in the attic. After deciding to venture into this foreign land, Anna quickly finds herself in hostile territory. A Chancellor wants her dead and others believe she is the chosen one. A grey eyed, blonde hunk named Hayden rescues her, but he also sends Anna's stomach into knots and her knees close to buckling.Amongst romance and an ominous threat of a Chancellor looming over her, Anna also finds herself in situations she would have never fathomed to happen upon. Along with fighting abnormally large birds, hiding in magical tree trunks, and eating magical beads, she also must try to rescue an Empress. With a necklace of invisibility, a time turning bracelet and a dagger, this is still no easy task for her and Anna doesn’t need her newly acquired Book of Answers to figure that either. It seems in this world, nothing is ever simple here for Anna Kippling, but she is also slowly learning nothing is impossible either; not even for her. How far would you go to reach your potential? How much would you sacrifice for love? And… is it possible to outwit death?Second Edition 2013",
