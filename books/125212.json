  "description": "Former professor Ansel Weston, retired from teaching due to an undisclosed illness, toys with the idea of unraveling his entire life. Meanwhile he works with his doctor, Henry Abbott, to begin conducting research of a morbid nature in their bizarre home. The little girl who crawls under their porch knows nothing of any of this. She's only looking for a safe place to hide. When Ansel notices her there and smiles rather than yell or order her out, she thinks she's found it.",
