  "description": "Liv has been tormented for the past five weeks with fevers, mood swings, and a crushing disappointment. After the killings were solved she thought she would return to her old self, and go back to work not caring about much; but her fever won’t go away, and she’s actually started to black out from it. Not only that, Jared hasn’t contacted her, and Luke seems to be keeping a strange distance as well.Everything goes from bad to worse when Dr. Wineman shows up on her doorstep and tells her that her fever is a symptom of her Change, and she’s going through the process of becoming Eidolon. What Eidolon though is a mystery, and nobody seems to recognize what she’s turning into.There have also been a recent string of animal attacks, and a government agency that nobody has heard of has stepped in to help. They begin to look into the deaths, and are led straight to Liv. She shrugs them off, but now when she blacks out she’s started to see visions of people dying, real people. And she’s started to be overcome with an inexplicable urge to follow, and help, the killer no matter the cost.",
