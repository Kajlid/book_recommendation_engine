  "description": "Trent and Hayden have been together for as long as they can remember.  Best friends. Boyfriends. Now lovers looking to discover a new side of their relationship, all they want is to be together and to get out of the poverty that surrounds them at every turn. Unfortunately, Trent knows that with family stacked against them and the secrets Hayden must hide, it won’t be easy. But he’ll protect Hayden with everything he has.  No matter what he has to hide from everyone else, all Hayden has ever needed was Trent’s love and acceptance—and he’s always had it. No matter how different he felt or what he confessed to Trent, Hayden has always known Trent would be right there beside him. But with wolves closing in at the door and desperation rising, he knows finishing high school and getting away might be harder than they’d ever expected.  Surrounded by anger and people who would never understand their relationship, they know college will be their safe haven, but only if they can fight the deck that seems to be stacked against them.  43k words Story Contains: MM sexual content, BDSM elements, spankings, age play, and gender-fluid dressing.",
