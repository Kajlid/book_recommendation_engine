  "description": "When reporter Bert Chekov falls to his death, his colleague James Tyrone is suspicious. Chekov's column had recently recommended some 'can't-lose' horses, who then wound up out of the running on race day. Tyrone thinks he can prove it was murder, but he may not live to tell the tale. Because as the dead man has already made clear, there's no such thing as a sure thing.",
