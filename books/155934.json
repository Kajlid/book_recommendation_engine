  "description": "From Russia, With Love... How do you destroy your enemy? Go for the heart, then take over the brain. The Z1219 virus, created by Russia's most skilled scientists, is the deadliest biological weapon in history. Harbored in the human bloodstream, it remains undetected until detonated. Once detonated, the host becomes a walking corpse with only one goal: Eat everyone. And now it is in America, packaged in the mail order brides the Russians shipped over to destroy us all. With the disease now running rampant and no cure yet discovered, it is every uninfected person for himself. Homes are destroyed and the families inside them torn apart. Relationships can help or hurt as those left uninfected discover they are not entirely untouched by the disease. Follow a group of strangers as they struggle to do anything necessary to survive without losing their humanity in the process. Some will win this challenge. Most will lose. It's a new world and the zombies aren't the only monsters. They're just the easiest to recognize in a country gone horribly wrong.",
