  "description": "Big Burly Biker Bear + Shy, Bookish Librarian!   A Paranormal Werebear Bear Shifter Romance Series.  This is a standalone of about 150 pages with a Happily Ever After ending and No cliffhanger. This book also contains several additional bonus stories to enjoy!  Hutch is an asshole—a giant, scary-looking, Harley-riding, asshole who has long rejected his mate, Veronica, the town’s introverted, scholarly, librarian.  Lately, Veronica has been coming out of her shell. She’s dancing on bar tops, telling the girls which sex toys to buy, and has turned Thursday nights at the library into a naughty book club!  Hutch screwed up. Big time. He should have claimed Veronica when he had the chance. Now that she’s being showered with more male attention than she knows what to do with, Hutch is just about at his wit's end!  NOTE This is a series centered around the southwestern town of Burden, Texas. For good ol’ bears Hawthorne, Wyatt, Hutch, Sterling, and Sam, livin’ is easy, beer flows freely, and pretty women are abundant. The last thing the shifters of Burden are thinking about is finding a mate or settling down. But, fate has its own plan…  WARNING: THIS BOOK CONTAINS GRAPHIC SCENES OF A SEXUAL NATURE AND IS NOT INTENDED FOR READERS UNDER 18.",
