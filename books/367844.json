  "description": "What’s weird around here? That’s a question Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman have enjoyed asking for years—and their offbeat sense of curiosity led them to create the best-selling phenomenon, Weird N.J.  But why should they stop at New Jersey when there’s so much that’s strange, odd, and utterly nutty all across the U.S.? So they’ve expanded their universe, taken their act on the road, and found stories of weirdness in every state in the nation. The result is a travel guide of sorts, but to the kind of places voyagers will never find on their everyday maps. Instead, it’s chock full of the local legends, crazy characters, cursed roads, abandoned sites, and bizarre roadside attractions. So come along and visit such unique spots as Midgetville, explore long-empty insane asylums, and go through forgotten tunnels—but keep in mind that the maniacal Bunnyman just might be hiding out in one of them. Some of what’s out there is disturbing, some of it's hilarious, but all of it is unforgettably…weird.",
