  "title": "Colliding Worlds: How Cutting-Edge Science Is Redefining Contemporary Art",
  "description": "In recent decades, an exciting new art movement has emerged in which artists utilize and illuminate the latest advances in science. Some of their provocative creations a live rabbit implanted with the fluorescent gene of a jellyfish, a gigantic glass-and-chrome sculpture of the Big Bang (pictured on the cover) can be seen in traditional art museums and magazines, while others are being made by leading designers at Pixar, Google s Creative Lab, and the MIT Media Lab. In Colliding Worlds, Arthur I. Miller takes readers on a wild journey to explore this new frontier. Miller, the author of Einstein, Picasso and other celebrated books on science and creativity, traces the movement from its seeds a century ago when Einstein s theory of relativity helped shape the thinking of the Cubists to its flowering today. Through interviews with innovative thinkers and artists across disciplines, Miller shows with verve and clarity how discoveries in biotechnology, cosmology, quantum physics, and beyond are animating the work of designers like Neri Oxman, musicians like David Toop, and the artists-in-residence at CERN s Large Hadron Collider.From NanoArt to Big Data, Miller reveals the extraordinary possibilities when art and science collide.\"",
