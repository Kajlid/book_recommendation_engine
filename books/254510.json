  "description": "Remember With Me  Cadeyrn Maitland has a secret he's been living with for centuries. He is the reason for his wifeâ€™s death. Cursed with immortality for his disobedience by the priestess he swore fealty as he searches the world over as his wife Anna is reborn again and again. He must convince one of her reincarnations to fall in love with him and remind her who she really is to break the curse. But, he's been little more than a transient for the last several decades and on the verge of giving up.  Journey Jones has no memory of her life before the age of ten when she wakes in a hospital, the sole survivor of a horrific crash. Adopted and raised by a nurse, she's had a good life. When her adopted mother falls ill and decides to return to her hometown, Journey, known as Jo, leaves behind her career, joins her mother and takes on a job at Maitland Enterprises.  Unknown to Jo, she bears a remarkable resemblance to Anna. Cade is convinced Jo is his love reborn. But is she?  There's darkness around Maryvell again, and Cade, a long-time warrior, is powerless to stop it when it focuses on Jo and her past. It becomes a race to see whose memories return first: Jo's, before the crash, or Anna's love for Cade?   **Remember With Me is the 3rd book in the Magical Love Series.

To experience the maximum enjoyment out of the series, it is recommended you read the books in order.
