  "title": "A Multitude of Sins: Golden Brown, The Stranglers and Strange Little Girls: The Autobiography",
  "description": "Autobiography by the singer and creative force of 70s rock group The Stranglers. This will be the first autobiography by any leading figure from the punk era and the first to be written by the author, drawing from his own unique and unforgettable experiences. Hugh was lead singer, guitarist and main songwriter with The Stranglers, and now brings his unique style, humour and insight to describe the story of his life. The book begins with a chapter about Hugh's decision to leave The Stranglers in 1990, and explains, in full and frank detail, why this key moment in UK music history has never been fully explained. The book will also covers the heady days of early punk in London, described by someone who was at its epicentre, along with the Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Damned. The life and times of the Stranglers, one of the most notorious and gifted rock groups of the 70s and 80s, are described in detail, including the drug busts, fights, prison terms and -- in one case -- the tying up of journalists. Throughout this time Hugh encountered a host of other extraordinary people, who are now household Malcolm McClaren, Joe Strummer, Kate Bush, Debbie Harry and Hazel O'Connor, to name a few, and he will recount the outrageous times he lived through with them. His 'inside take' on the other members of the Stranglers will be of special interest to the huge fan base of the era, which enabled The Stranglers' -- Greatest Hits album to sell one million copies in the UK on its release in 1990, and which continues to be discovered by the younger music generation of today.",
