  "description": "It’s been a year since Tommy’s near death experience in D.C. A year since he was thrust into a hidden world of sentient machines and genetically engineered soldiers. A year since everything changed. Now, at fifteen, he has plans, plans that begin with starting his own company and end with changing the world. But to take that first step, he needs money he doesn't have. His so-called friends among the Nospious and the Society of Machines are perfectly willing to loan him the money he needs. But it won’t come cheap. The Nospious want his loyalty, and the machines . . . well, the machines want him to solve a murder. Or do they? Once again, the teenage prodigy is caught up in a world of politics, conspiracies, and lies. If he wants to survive, the only way out is through.",
