But it's been a month and so far she has failed. Unable to see her broken hearted and knowing that she would soon be claimed by the sea witch, the three eldest sisters presented her with a knife to kill him.She loves him too much to do so and now the task falls to me. If I can kill the prince, my sister will be safe to mend her broken heart. And what does it matter, he is only human.

He is lying on his back, but is partially sitting up to stare at something off in the distance.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is Always Write\" event.
