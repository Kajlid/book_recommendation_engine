  "title": "The Seeker",
  "description": "Mysterious women, noble quests, and world-altering magic. To fairly typical nineteen year-old Raphael Carpenter the only place on Earth he could find these things were in the pages of his favorite books. But Raph is about to find out that he’s not so typical and his is not the only Earth. When fireball wielding wizards from a parallel world show up to kill him, Raph is forced to go on the run and confront a startling revelation. He is the last living heir to the legacy of Arthur Pendragon. A legacy that makes him the defender of an infinite number of parallel worlds. A legacy that some would like to see ended at any cost.  Now, trapped on a world that is not his own, Raph must succeed where his ancestor failed. He must find the Grail and master the art of Bending, the shaping of reality to one’s will. If he can’t, he will die. And everything will die with him.",
