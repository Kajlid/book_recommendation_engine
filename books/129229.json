  "description": "Simply Simon Julie enjoyed her work as a medical secretary at St. Bravo's Hospital, so it came as a shock when her boss announced his retirement. His replacement, Simon van der Driesma, was younger, more energetic and worked her much harderâ€”which she could have accepted if only he would call her Julie, and not \"Miss Beckworth\" in that cool voice! From the start, both of them had the wrong impression of the other. What would it take for the truth to be revealed?",
