Instead, she is date-raped, and left emotionally broken. She builds a wall around her heart and begins spiraling downward on a road filled with drinking, drugs and physical abuse. When Seth re-enters her life a few years later, the walls around her heart slowly come down and the two of them fall in love.Unfortunately sometimes, fate has other ideas, and we're forced down a different road from which we initially set out.",
