  "description": "When the woman you love is lost, how hard will you fight to get her back?  Following the birth of her daughter, Kadence Knight finds herself in a battle she never prepared for. With desperation and unhappiness threatening to overwhelm her, a sense of hopelessness pulls her away from the one thing she has always longed for: a family.  As Nix watches his wife struggle with something he doesn't understand, he can't help but feel disconnected to his woman. The Kadence he once knew has drifted into the darkness. In her place is a shadow of the woman she once was, one who is fearful of the impossible...failing their daughter.  This Valentine’s Day, Nix has one goal — to reclaim the woman who gave him everything.    *Please note this is a novella and features the characters from the previous storyline. The events of Reclaimed take place after Incandescent and Affliction. Book one and two in the Knights Rebels MC. To get the full advantage of the story, and character development, I strongly suggest you read in order.",
