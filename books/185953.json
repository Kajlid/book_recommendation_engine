  "description": "Not your typical love story... not your ordinary hero... Having crash-landed in the past and survived a volcano, Janet and the others are reunited with Chief Marro’s tribe, seeking shelter at the winter cave. After a streak of light passes over in the night sky, Janet and Phil investigate, finding evidence of a plane crash, people having come through time, but they all perished. The government has begun a time travel initiative, although it’s a suicide mission. Archaeologist Amy Sandhurst is appalled to discover this, but her curiosity propels her to want to be a part of the team, although this worries her fiancé, Brian Lutz. After Janet gives birth, the clan travels to Marro’s decimated homeland, finding the rest of his tribe enslaved by a savage, cannibalistic culture. However, this may be the least of their worries, because modern man has, somehow magically appeared… having come through time.",
