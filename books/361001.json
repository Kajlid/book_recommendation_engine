In it he gave instructions that his \"clever\" niece was allowed to live in his house for one month, and in that time she has to \"prove her wits\" and find a more recent second will. At the end of that time, if she hasn't, all his worldly goods go to charitable institutions and she will be left with nothing. Her request?
