  "description": "To the Walkers, Delan was a monstrosity, big and clumsy with odd growths sticking out of its back. Controlled by a cruel master, a sorcerer who practices dark magic to keep Delan his slave, Delan discovers new hope when, aided by Eia the Aeyrie, it goes through a metamorphosis that transforms it into the beautiful, winged being it was always meant to be. Learning the truth of its heritage may not be enough to save Delan – and the entire Aeyrie race – from Teksan and his diabolical plans for conquest.",
