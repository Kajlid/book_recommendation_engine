  "description": "Adam Hill is the owner/engineer of Overhill Engineering, an independent product testing company. He and his three contracted engineers, Alice Delvecci, Tom Woody, and wisecracking Salvador Lolliman have accepted a contract to test a revolutionary navigation device- a handheld unit similar to a GPS receiver that has the capability to provide precise navigational information without the need of a supporting satellite system. During field testing in the remote wilderness of northwest Georgia, they meet John Carter, a Cherokee Indian who informs them it is May, 1838. Eventually convinced, they meet several Cherokee families and individuals and quickly realize their perception of the Cherokee culture in 1838 is much different than reality. They are introduced to the true Tsalagi Nation, a well-organized community of intellectual and spiritual people who are frustrated by the relentless encroachment of white settlers on their lands and the broken promises of the U.S. government. Despite the Cherokees attempts to accommodate the settler's lust for their land and adapt their own government and social structure to be more acceptable to the whites, the state of Georgia insists on their complete removal of all Native Americans from its borders. The state is prepared to enforce those demands forcibly with its militia, backed by the immense power of federal armed forces, leaving the Cherokee little choice but to leave behind their beloved ancestral homeland.As the story progresses, the team must put aside the shock of time-travel to deal with the dangerous situation they now face, the Cherokee roundup and the beginning of the Trail of Tears.",
