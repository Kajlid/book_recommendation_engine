  "description": "Finally comes the ultimate book for all those seeking to know more about the philosophy behind The Matrix and its sequels. Suppose that this world is not what it seems, and that humanity is actually just a food source supplementing a reign of machines. Welcome to the premise behind the world of The Matrix : the movie phenomenon and massive box-office series that has also produced some of film's most intelligent and thoughtful moments in the last ten years.In the Matrix movies, \"reality\" is just a dreamscape, a representation that six billion points of view agree to agree is \"real.\" So if the only reality we know is a cunning and elaborate fa√ßade, what then does that signify for us? Matrix Warrior gives us the means to understand this premise and its implications on our knowledge of self and place. Combining an in-depth examination of the film with philosophical inquiry and the teachings of Castandeda, Jake Horsley has produced in Matrix Warrior a profound yet witty analysis-and all readers need to get \"unplugged.\"",
