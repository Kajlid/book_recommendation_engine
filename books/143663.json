  "description": "Space! Vast. Kinda dark. Filled with dots. Not a very impressive place to be stuck in. Time flies at a snail's pace when you're just babysitting other people. Mind starts to wander. Senses are dulled. Skills become rusty. The voices in your head start sounding less insane with each passing day. It feels like this lifeless limbo will never end. AND THEN HUGE BLOODTHIRSTY MONSTERS ATTACK! Yeah... You have fun with that.",
