  "title": "Straight Roommate",
  "description": "Mitchell’s life consists of studying for his latest chemistry exam or working on perfecting his personal lube--a combination of his love of science and sex. Not that he’s actually had sex with another guy in a long time. That would require him leaving his dorm and opening himself up to relationship drama. No thanks. He has grad school to prepare for. But when his roommate Landon comes home drunk from a frat party and offers to let Mitchell test his latest batch of lube out on him, Mitchell knows it’s a bad idea--not only is Landon drunk, he’s straight! But Mitchell is unable to resist the sexy jock. Consequences can wait until tomorrow. ***This is a short story! This series contains one night stands, and male/male sex/interaction. If you don't want to read about that, don't click on this book!*** Additional Contains gay, mm, male/male, anal, erotic sex",
