  "title": "Meeting Him in the Wilderness: A True Story of Adventure and Faith",
  "description": "This true story begins with the author following the flashing tail-lights of a U-Haul truck driven by her husband and ends four years later as another truck is about to drive off. In between, an engrossing story unfolds about a small family seeking fulfillment in the wilderness of Washington state in areas accessible only by floatplane or a four-hour boat trip. What happens to this family as they meet each new experience makes a captivating adventure story told with wit and piety. Olson writes with such simple beauty of expression that a walk in the forest becomes an enchanting encounter with nature. And the terror of their four year old daughter seriously hurt, hours and untold miles from competent help, leaves an indelible imprint on the reader. The motivation to leave middle America with its comfortable homes, paved streets and shopping centers is a search for complete happiness. But the Olsons find more than personal fulfillment among the giant trees, towering snow-capped peaks, singing streams and a few dozen people very unlike themselves. They also find the presence, the power and the majesty of God.",
