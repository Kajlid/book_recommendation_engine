  "description": "Avery Fletcher makes a better friend than a lover—at least he thinks so. Well, him and every woman he’s ever dated. Now his encounters are brief and satisfying. There’s really no need to complicate things.Though, when he sits alone on his porch listening to the cicadas, he has a brief lapse in judgment and yearns for someone to talk to.Helena Davenport doesn’t need a man—nor does she want one. As heiress to her late father’s fortune and business, she’s here to impress. But apparently, you can’t get away from societal expectations—even in the twenty-first century, and the board of directors wants this queen to crown a king.When she finds herself being tattooed by none other than bad boy Avery at a bachelorette party, she hatches a plan. He’s perfect—tattoos, unruly beard, and a sharp wit. Oh, and incapable of falling in love with her. He makes the perfect fake boyfriend.She’ll get the company board off her back by giving them exactly what they asked for, and watch them eat their words. What could possibly go wrong?Social events put the pair to the test, forcing them to get cozy—a little too cozy. The situation soon turns red hot and a little worrisome.As the plan to stay platonic starts to fall apart, can the two keep their cool or will they succumb to the heat between them?",
