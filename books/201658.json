  "description": "Working for the Mossad was never as dangerous as retiring from it. Shahla is an Israeli asset concealed in her American job, and an injury leads to a new life with a man who restores her body and soul. The forbidden union challenges the couple when Shahla's Persian Jewish culture clashes with his. The marriage is further complicated when she refuses to discuss her past, and an unseen figure for whom she has affection overshadows their marriage. The family Passover answers many questions about this clandestine visitor, but the celebration turns deadly. Shahla is drawn into a war not her own, and the massacre leads to an unimaginable chain of events. When the Mossad and her trade craft fail, only faith remains. The Child is the first book of the Eagle and Child trilogy.",
