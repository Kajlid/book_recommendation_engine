  "description": "Rich boys don’t fraternize with the help.They don't torture the help.They don't crave the help.For as long as I can remember, my mom and I have lived on the edge of ruin, so when she finally gets a decent job offer, she moves us cross-country to take it.Who cares if it means working as a live-in housekeeper for a man wealthier than God? The paycheck is good, and it comes with a roof over our heads.She even manages to get me enrolled in the fancy prep academy his son goes to—the kind that spits out future CEOs and politicians like a vending machine.But this new town has a few things my old one didn’t… Like secrets that could get a person killed, and four of the hottest, meanest guys I’ve ever met.I might live in their world now, but I am not a part of it, and they’ll do whatever it takes to remind me of that.We go to school together, live together, and share a dangerous secret, but as far as Lincoln, River, Dax, and Chase are concerned…I’m just the help.***AUTHOR'S NOTE: The Help is a reverse harem high school bully romance, the first book in the Kings of Linwood Academy trilogy. It contains cursing and sexual situations.",
