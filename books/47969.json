  "title": "Long and Short Australian Stories",
  "description": "This is an easy to read collection of Short Stories set in modern Australia. Many of the stories have romantic themes; a few concentrate on human interest. Unlike the author's previous collections of Short Stories, this volume starts and ends with unrelated, relatively long tales, spanning the years. Some stories, such as 'To Break The Mould', have quite deep and penetrating themes, whilst others like 'Our Romance at Sea' are much lighter.",
