  "description": "The robot Pentser is the last of his kind. Technology is obsolete. It only exists in museums and the collections of oddballs like Govil. Govil is a 19th Century Romantic living in a 31st Century utopia, a Garden of Eden manufactured by GenieCorp™ that meets Mankind’s every need, whim, and fancy with biological Creature Comforts™. Illness, war, poverty, famine, and death are gone. And so are love, parents, children, and families. A world where everyone is eternally happy, healthy, and wealthy; everyone but Govil. Like any other decent 19th Century Romantic hero, Govil needs to discover a great love, a great cause, and Pentser is game to help. Man and robot team up to do the unthinkable, create a deliberately average, normal woman, Eve. In the conflict which ensues, Govil, Pentser, Eve, and GenieCorp™ each in turn experience the same eternal beware of what you wish for, it may come true. EVE is Aurelio O’Brien’s vividly original, sharp, sweet, and satirical tale of Govil’s adventure. Part Swift, part Shelley, and a little Shaw, EVE takes place in a future that is both stunning and silly, beautiful and earthy, but at all times grounded in the obscure psychology of human desire.",
