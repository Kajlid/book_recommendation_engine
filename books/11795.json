A true misfit, he grows up happier communing with nature than with people. While he is straightforward, honest, and a doting father, he can be a difficult, taciturn husband - but he's the last person one would suspect of being a killer. Then he wakes in the woods one morning to find himself branded a wife-beater and under investigation for murder. Suddenly his small world falls apart as he loses wife, daughter, liberty, livelihood, and, almost, his mind. Bereft of his family - though cleared of wrongdoingLawrence undertakes a journey to the Caribbean, where a passionate encounter with an aging actress throws his life into further disarray. Meanwhile, the exasperated women in his lifemother, ex-wife, and enigmatic mistress - are forced to accept that their lives must feel the gardener's blade if they are to bloom afresh. Seeking sanctuary at an alternative therapy center among the giant redwoods of northern California, Lawrence finally stumbles upon the possibility of happiness, but not before some chance encounters and long-hidden secrets conspire to unearth the deeply buried roots of his misfortune.",
