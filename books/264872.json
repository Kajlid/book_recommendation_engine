  "description": "Maurits Cornelis Escher (Leeuwarden, June 17, 1898--March 27, 1972 in Laren) was a Dutch mathematical artist known for his woodcuts, lithographs and mezzotints which feature impossible constructions, explorations of infinity, and tessellations. This book has numerous examples of how his extraordinary pictures of logic fool the brain into believing the impossible--water can run uphill and steps that go upwards.",
