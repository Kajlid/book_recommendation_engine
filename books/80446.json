  "title": "Chuck Palahniuk: Fight Club, Invisible Monsters, Choke",
  "description": "Offering a world full of traumatized characters trapped in a consumerist society where men, women, sex and gender have become unstable commodities, Chuck Palahniuk has become one of the most controversial of contemporary novelists. This book is the first guide to bring together scholars from a full range of critical perspectives to explore three of Palahniuk's most widely-studied Fight Club , Invisible Monsters and Choke . Examining these works in light of such key critical themes as violence, masculinity, postmodern aesthetics and trauma, the book also explores the ethical dimension of Palahniuk's work that is often lost in the heat of the controversies surrounding his books.Together with annotated guides to further reading, Chuck Palahniuk also includes section introductions surveying the contexts and reception of each novel, making this an essential guide for students and scholars of contemporary literature.",
