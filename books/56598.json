  "description": "After moving around his entire life, Art Pengriffin is at last settling into a new school. He's got a crush on the best-looking girl in his class and joined a band to impress her. When they rip the school concert on the eve of his 14th birthday and a record producer parent wants to sign him, it's happy days. Until mum Egrainne announces they're moving again. What is her problem? Unknown to Art, his father was the magician Merlin, Egrainne is King Arthur's sister and they're being pursued by Four terrifying ghouls hell-bent on killing him for his father's powers, which Art can take when he's 14. Art thinks his mum has lost it, big time, until he's back in time in Camelot with unsuspecting school crush Megan, seeking a sword and stone. Egrainne wants the magic to die, so Art stays a normal boy. If Art takes the powers, he must fight the Four - alone. Lose and they will destroy the world. Art must choose, and fast - his birthday is only hours away.",
