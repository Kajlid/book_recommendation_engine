  "description": "Jax Justice has trust issues. The mark on his eight-pack abs reminds him of it every day. \n  Abandoned by his mother. Betrayed by his ex. Now seemingly forgotten by the country he fought so hard to honor and protect.  Burned one too many times. There's no more point in trying.  Until her.  Can Jax put his troubled past behind him and learn to trust, and to love, again?  In this small Midwest town everybody knows everything about everybody...or so they thought. What secrets are Kate hiding? Can Jax protect Kate from her stalker and win her heart? Can she win his trust?  What neither one of them counted on was falling for the other. But that might be just what they need. Each other.  ***This is a standalone novel with a HEA. No cliffhangers. No profanity. Written by a USMC Veteran.***",
