Not one to give in to forces of nature, particularly when they’re female and fifteen years her junior, Maggie is determined to suppress her feelings.But one soft summer night, with the prairie breezes swirling over her skin like the breath of an impatient lover, Maggie Tanner has to decide whether to deny her yearnings or ride the wind.",
