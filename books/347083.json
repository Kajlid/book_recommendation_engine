  "description": "Gold Medal Winner in the 2010 Independent Publisher Book Awards Pete McFadden has stumbled into fame and fortune, and he's not going to question it. A lost job, a heavy dose of cynicism and a big mouth have catapulted him into an improbable career as a trendy self-help guru, selling concocted visions of the future and dubious insights into his customer's souls. He has sold out, and is enjoying every minute of it. But when his dodgy business becomes a weapon in the hands of a manipulative cult leader and a ruthless corporation, Pete learns a brutal truth - when everything is for sale, wishful thinking has the highest price tag of all.",
