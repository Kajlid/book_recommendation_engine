  "description": "NEW ORLEANS HELD THE KEY TO UNLOCKING HER PAST --- AND UNLEASHING HER PASSIONS ... Nothing in sixteen-year-old Mary MacAllistair's years in a convent school had prepared her for the mysterious box left to her by the mother she had never known. The name and address carved beneath the lid and its enigmatic contents were her only clues to her real identity, but enough to light a ragging desire to find her family and her past. Thus Mary would begin an unforgettable journey to that town of irrepressible hopes and dangerous dreams --- New Orleans. Here from an exotic bordello to an antebellum plantation to a sultry Quadroon Ball, she would ultimately expose the darkest secrets of the city itself. Here she would meet the seductive and irresistibly handsome Valmount Saint-Brevin, a man with the power to ruin her. And here she would have the chance to find the greatest legacy of all: the fulfillment of love.",
