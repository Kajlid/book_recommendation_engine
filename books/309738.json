  "description": "Men and women who protect the world from things that go bump in the night. Cerridwyn Lavaine is hoping a move to a new state will bring a fresh start to her life. When she meets Maxen Maclean, she thinks it just might. He's tall and gorgeous. Then Cerri's new home gets blown up before she even gets to see it, and she's forced to move in with Max and his four younger brothers. She soon discovers that the magical abilities she supposedly has but never believed worked actually do. If all that wasn't enough, someone from another dimension wants her for reasons unknown. Max doesn't even need to meet Cerri to know there's something special about her. Just hearing her voice over the phone is enough. Then he meets her, and it only gets better. At least until he realizes she is in some serious danger. Can he protect her? Life just got a lot more complicated, but hopefully there's still time for some romance. HOLDING OUT FOR A HUNTER is a full-length, stand-alone romance with paranormal & fantasy elements. There is no cliffhanger and it ends with an HEA.",
