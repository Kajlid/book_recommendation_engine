  "description": "Gordon Kirkland brings his award-winning humor writing to the topic of the holiday season. He exposes the world to his feelings about everything from children's Christmas pageants, to artificial trees, and holiday lights.Fans of Kirkland's other five collections of short humorous stories (three of which received the Stephen Leacock Award of Merit for Humour,) will enjoy more of his unique style focusing on the fun and foibles of daily life during the so-called joyous season.In this collection, Kirkland stretches his muscles as a lyricist, writing new words for several old and familiar holiday songs.For Better Or For Worse creator Lynn Johnston says, \"I love to read his stuff, I just wouldn't want to be married to him.\" (It's a sentiment shared by a lot of women who sympathize with his long suffering wife, Diane.)Fellow humor writer, Dave Barry says, \"As a fellow class clown suffering from maturity impairment, I salute him.\"See for yourself, Kirkland will have you ho-ho-hoing from start to finish!",
