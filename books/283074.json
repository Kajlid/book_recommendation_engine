Nathaniel tells Jonah that he too has lived in Paris, where he resumed the studies he had abandoned to play basketball professionally. There he fell in love with a Parisian graduate student named Laura Pertrossian, who abruptly left not only him, but her entire life for a South American destination unknown. Nathaniel, in his grief, returned him to coach basketball for kids living in low-income neighborhoods. When he is unable to persuade Jonah to remain a teacher, Nathaniel hands him a letter to give to Laura were he to find her during his travels. Jonah and Octavio depart for Rio de Janeiro where Jonah discovers how different it is to be a black North American in South America. When Octavio falls in love with a Brazilian art student, Jonah finds himself making his way down the Southern Cone alone where a chance encounter will change the way he sees everything.",
