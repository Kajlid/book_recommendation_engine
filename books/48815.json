Now storms are forming indoors, lizards are roaming the halls, a priceless treasure has gone missing and time is running out. Eleven-year-old Lydia thinks the key to bringing her parents back to the way they used to be may lie in the section of the library labeled “Witchcraft.\" But is she fighting witchcraft or is she herself the witch?[McMahon's story] \"was just flat-out well written all the way through. I was caught up immediately and my attention never flagged. The details are precisely and vividly rendered...the pacing is swift and sure.\" Poet Sharon Byron. 120 pages, ages 9-12",
