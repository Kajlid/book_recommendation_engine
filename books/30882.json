  "description": "Thrown into the fray two years ago by the bite of a rogue werewolf, Bobbie finds herself caught in the shockingly unfamiliar world of shifters and vampires. Her world is turned upside down by the fact that she’s a werewolf who can’t shift. Only the fact that she’s fated to be the mate of the Alpha of a local pack spares her life. She lives day to day under the rule of her abusive husband and the constant reminder that she is an abomination that shouldn’t have been allowed to live. And to top it all off, she is snatched from her packlands by a lunatic vampire spewing ridiculous lies about her mate and something called a wolfwitch.James thought it was a simple enough mission. Negotiate the release of the wolfwitch from the local pack. Talk to them reasonably and sensibly and convince them of the error of their ways, forcibly if need be. But for the first time in centuries he finds himself thrown completely off balance. And by a woman, no less. Bobbie is a seductive, tempting she-devil of a woman, but it’s not the stake she plunges into his heart that breaks it. It’s the fact that she belongs to another man.This is a story about the wolfwitch. A rare, once-in-a-generation breed of shifter who can never shift, but holds the fate of all Were-kind in her hands. Whoever controls the wolfwitch has the potential to control the world, and some will stop at nothing to own her.",
