  "description": "Mariana isn’t the kind of woman I ever expected to have a chance with. Not when I’m a rough enforcer, someone who shouldn’t be within ten feet of anyone as innocent as Mariana. But I can’t shake my need to have her, and when she looks at me with those big eyes, I can feel the heat behind them. She wants me just as badly.So I take her, all of her, and I claim her body and soul for myself. She’s the only one who’s ever been able to tame my violent heart.But we have a past full of shadows, and there’s one in particular we’ll have to face before we can start our new life together. Even so, I’ll never let Mariana slip through my fingers, no matter what.MINK's Note: Capturing His Kitten originally appeared as a bonus story in the Hidden Love Anthology, but now you can enjoy it all by itself along with your kitty and your coffee.",
