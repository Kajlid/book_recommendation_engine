  "title": "Both Sides",
  "description": "Fresh out of college, wild and girl-crazy Jane Graves is a flame-throwing member of the in-your-face direct action group, the Dyke Defenders. As inwardly controlled as she is outwardly outrageous, Jane would never admit that she falls into bed with scores of women to avoid falling in love with one. The polar opposite of her sister- except that they're both gay- athletic, well-mannered Fiona Graves keeps her life as organized as her day-timer. In fact, Fiona always seems so together that no one suspects how hard she is struggling to keep both her relationship and her writing career from falling apart. With Jane back in town, the two unlikely sisters and the many women in their lives cautiously cross paths, unaware that profound changes are about to take place as each learns to take a deeper look at both sides... of love, life and each other. A hot, humorous look at lesbian politics, family ties, and a community of women falling in and out of love.",
