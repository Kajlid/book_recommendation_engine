  "title": "Evolution's Embers",
  "description": "Time might march on but hidden in each human are the embers of evolution that flicker to life when nature insists.Earth is in trouble, flooded with pollution and uninhabitable for females, who are instead sent into space to live. As the birth rate becomes predominately male, the human race must find a way to stabilize the population. No chances will be taken on relationships doomed to failure because of personality conflicts. Males that desire a female to mate submit to intense testing and wait for a female whose results match. They will also agree to share-one female can provide children for two males and stabilizing the population must take precedence over personal choice.Jala is an Estroko, a female gladiator who trains and competes in martial arts. Only females can be Estroko and winning freedom from matching is an Estroko’s ultimate reward, but a dishonorable knee sweep ends that dream for Jala-sending her to be matched for reproduction.She comes face to face with a pair of males who consider her their match-and their possession. Jala won’t abandon her dreams because science says Cassian and Sion were meant for her. Cassian and Sion can’t fathom why Jala ignores the passion igniting between them.In an era when science controls attraction, what happens to the tender emotions that can bind more than just the body? Love doesn’t show up on test pages, it flows through the blood and takes root in the heart. Warning, this title contains hot and steamy sex between two and three people, explained in contemporary graphic language.",
