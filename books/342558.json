  "description": "In this book, author Donald L Hilton Jr. MD explores the destructive power of pornography addiction, not just from a moral and spiritual perspective, but with the scrutiny of modern science. Current research tells us that there is little difference in physical or chemical changes in the pleasure and control centers of the brain regardless of whether the addiction is \"from a chemical or an experience,\" as stated in he journal Science.Relying on the latest research on addiction, and merging this knowledge with spiritual aspects of repentance and recovery, the author provides understanding and hope to those who seek healing and restoration of both body and spirit, which are the \"soul of man.\" Donald L. Hilton has graciously decided to donate the proceeds from this book to SA Lifeline Foundation. A none profit dedicated to helping those that suffer from Pornography / Sexual Addiction. As of Feb. 2010 SA Lifeline Foundation has donated a thousand books to individuals who can have benefited greatly from this text.
