  "description": "India Sommers is a librarian and a talented historian, so when a stranger asks her opinion on an ancient but obviously fake coin, she thinks no more about it. That is, until he is murdered outside the very library she works in. It soon becomes apparent that there is far more to this situation than meets the eye and she is quickly recruited by Brandon Walker, a special service intelligence officer, investigating the disappearance of a very special young girl. As the facts unravel, they realise that an ancient artefact linked to the cult of the Vestal Virgins from ancient Rome, may hold the key to her whereabouts and Brandon draws on India's vast historical knowledge to unravel clues that date right back through history to the time of the great flood. Slowly, the full horror and mind blowing truth of what they have discovered becomes clear and they become involved in a race against time in a horrific and shocking finale.",
