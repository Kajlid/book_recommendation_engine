I drove thirteen hours to Everlee Falls, Georgia, to live with my Gamma for senior year. To give myself the chance to fall in love with a life that I’d missed out on for far too long.I was expecting to find hope, I was hoping to find freedom, but I never expected him.I was too damaged to recognize the beginning.But all it takes is a moment, and he was positive he’d invade every one of mine. If I pushed, he pulled. If I ran, he followed.I was his fate.Meekai was my north star.I was what he chose to remember,he was a goodbye my soul refused to forget⠀⠀*Trigger Warning: Please be warned, this duet includes scenes of sexual assault and sensitive subject matter.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀",
