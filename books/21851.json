  "description": "\"Huck always said it was a powerful lot of trouble to write a book and if he'd a known it ahead of time, he wouldn't a gone through with it. That's his version of the truth, anyhow. And it's a lot more work than anyone bargains for when they sit down to write-but you add writin along with meand Huck comin back as twin brothers and the feline familiars of a twenty-first century witch-and you got even more trouble. A whole cauldron-full more. Anyhow, this time I guess it's me that has got to tellour story.\"",
