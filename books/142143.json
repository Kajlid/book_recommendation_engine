  "title": "Things I Must Remember: A Collection of Poetry",
  "description": "Once upon a time a poet sat down a spilled ink over the many wonders of life. But it didn't end in a magnificence of paper bound into a novel; instead, she assembled from the scribbles a chaotic, lyrical collection of poetry meant to be savored and enjoyed by anyone and everyone. Things I Must Remember is a distinctive and engaging collection of poetry divided in three sections: Adventures, Musings, and Quirkiness. This singularly unique selection of poems offers an unpretentious and yet intriguing look into subjects such as freedom, ordinary things turned extraordinary, and human nature... all from the eyes of a poet.",
