  "description": "Who says a little chick can’t make big, loud animal noises?Most little chicks barely make a peep, but not this little chick! While his brothers and sisters nestle close to their mother hen, this little chick struts off on his own to make some new friends in the farmyard. And he has a wonderful time of it - sliding off the back of a shiny pink pig, hopping along with frogs, skipping with a flock of frisky sheep, and imitating all the sounds these animals make. Full of playful detail, John Lawrence’s bold, energetic engravings will keep toddlers smiling, long after the oinking, mooing, baaing, and quacking are over.",
