She contemplates how she ended up at a place in her life where Clay is tugging at the last few threads keeping her from completely unraveling.

Just when he decides to get to the root of the problem no matter the outcome, he discovers his wife has harbored a secret nearly too painful to bear.Will their love be strong enough to withstand a revelation that will rock the foundation of their marriage?",
