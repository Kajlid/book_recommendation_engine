  "description": "Nothing is what it seems…  Basra is the eternal city—A paradise filled with relics of the old world. But whispers on the wind speak of destitution and hopelessness. There’s decay beneath the city’s surface.  And paradise is filled with lies and deceit…  As an ambassador for Tartarus, it’s my duty to bridge the gap between us and the other cities. We need these alliances now more than ever. Duty or not, I will seek out the truth of Basra.  Or die trying.",
