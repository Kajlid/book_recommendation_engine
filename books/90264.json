  "description": "Sindale, a city devastated by a ravaging earthquake, pulverizing the lives of many. Separating, and dividing families, changing the reality as they once knew it. Thousands of men, women, and children will forever be affected, but none as gravely as Rayden and Selene.A couple endlessly in love will struggle with their own battles, one against chaos and madding riots and the other… a nightmarish unearthly realm. Splitting the serene city in two by a mysterious confining veil, the boundaries are set and their mortal lives are at stake. What will it take to keep one’s own sanity, humanity, and one’s only love? Or will it be too late?",
