  "title": "Hank",
  "description": "The lives of three divergent families collide after the mutilated body of a man is found dumped beside a highway in California's pristine backcountry. When Governor Sheldon Desalvo comes under pressure to resolve an ongoing series of murders in the remote regions of the state, he gambles on a trial project consisting of roving agents with no ties to any one county. The first task for Senior Detective Jason Carmichael and his partner, Dena Manning, is to unravel who the man is, who would commit such a gruesome act, and why. At the outset, their only clues are a custom-made handgun and a cryptic message whispered in Spanish by a dying man. As the momentum of their case intensifies, the agents find that drugs and greed form the catalyst for this deadly clash of principles. Remaining neutral is a test of their own consciences as the agents wrestle with the reminder that they would not be alive today had it not been for the past actions of the man who is now their prime suspect-a man called simply, Hank. Praise for Hank, \"The real and unfortunate situation for many families is brought to life by this one-of-a-kind author.\" -Sergeant Matt Zelinsky, Tuolumne County Sheriff's Office, Sonora, California \"A heart-wrenching novel interlaced with spice and solid police protocol. The author is one of the more insightful writers when it comes to getting inside the heads of cops.\" -Dee Dees, author of Write Your Life Story in 28 Days",
