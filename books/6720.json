  "description": "Meet Jim Haskin. He's forty years old. He's worth around thirty-five million. He runs his own San Francisco ad firm, American Weather. AmWe's image is green and if your product is upcycled or hydro or vegan, they'll make you an ad. Behind the scenes, though, Jim supports the old captains of American industry; bleach, beer, guns. But all is not Jim's wife, Denise, is in a coma induced by a drug Jim helped promote. A live-in nurse and former Salvadorian gang member helps him care for her. And Jim's only child, Connor, has been sent to a boarding school three thousand miles away after assaulting another student. Orphaned at 14, Jim and his three closest friends grew up at Mr Hand's Home for Well-Behaved Boys. All have profited from the American Dream. In 2008, on the brink of the Presidential election, the quartet find themselves short on cash and look to Jim for a solution. The scheme he devises brings together a Death Row inmate, pay-per-view television, and most of America's major corporations. Everything is set for it to be his greatest achievement yet. \"American Weather\" is a remorselessly funny and savage take-down of modern America by an abundantly talented new writer.",
