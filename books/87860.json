  "title": "God Johnson The Unforgiven Diary of the Disciple of a Lesser God",
  "description": "Wannabe actress Liberty Abbott agrees to be the sole disciple of a lesser deity and Abe Lincoln lookalike named God Johnson, in exchange for a fast track to world-hunger-fighting-super-celebrityhood. As Liberty tries to give him her heart â€“ and a certain portion of her aura -- she breaks his Major Rule which is that humans shall not play god with other humans. He then must abandon her to the other lesser deities for their sport until she pays for her sin or dies. By the time Liberty discovers what the gods really want from her, she knows that what she wants from God Johnson is worlds away from her original plan. She must either accept the considerable and attractive sacrifice God Johnson makes for her, or leave the natural world and create her own brand of do-gooder stardom as the glamazon goddess she has become. Set in Madison, Wisconsin.",
