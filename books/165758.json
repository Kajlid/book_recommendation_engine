  "title": "The Rules According to Gracie",
  "description": "A satisfying category romance novella from Entangled's Lovestruck imprint… Rule number one: don't fall for the wrong guy. Gracie Greene has a shopping list for men. Career, financials, family...and a long list of rules to determine a guy's suitability. She's already disappointed her socialite mother once—now Gracie needs to find Mr. Perfect. Too bad she keeps getting distracted by her super-sexy, six-feet-of-tattooed-hotness friend, Des, who is so many shades of Mr. Wrong… Bar owner Des Chapman has vowed never again to get involved with society girls. Yet he's irresistibly drawn to Gracie—those lush curves, those lips, and her ridiculous ability to date the wrong guys. As Gracie's discouragement grows, Des realizes it's time to show her what she really needs in a man—and it has nothing to do with a briefcase and generous bank account. He'll teach Gracie the Rules According To Des…even if it means breaking his rule in the process.",
