  "description": "The Worst Children's Jobs in History takes you back to the days when being a kid was no excuse for getting out of hard labor. This book tells the stories of all the children whose work fed the nation, kept trains running, and put clothes on everyone’s backs over the last few hundred years of Britain’s history. From a jigger-turner to a turnip-picker, from an orderly boy to a matchbox maker, this book will tell you things you probably didn’t want to know about the back-breaking realities of being a child in the past.",
