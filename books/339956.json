  "description": "I kidnapped the Governor’s daughter for revenge.\n\nNow I’m fussing like a goddamn mother hen.\n\nI’m a mob boss, not a nanny, but one look at Erin Edwards crowds my brain with constant worry. Is she eating enough? Resting well? Is she warm? Is she safe?I need to focus, damn it—need to ruin her father’s life, then send her back to the smoking rubble, not get attached. What is wrong with me?But against all the odds, my captive doesn’t hate me like she should. She trusts me, crowding closer for comfort, and I…I can’t think. This is a disaster.Because when she blinks up at me like that, there’s nothing I wouldn’t give her. She can have my kingdom, my crown…My whole lonely life.\nKingpin All The Way is a short and steamy instalove novella, starring an ice cold mob boss and the captive who melts his heart.\n\n*Each book has an HEA, but the Very Merry Mob series is best read in order.*",
