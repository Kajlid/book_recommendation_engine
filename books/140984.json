  "title": "Scaredies Away! A Kid's Guide to Overcoming Worry and Anxiety",
  "description": "Eight-year-old Jack is scared...of the dark...of swimming in the ocean...and of riding the biggest roller coaster on the boardwalk. Jack usually runs away from what scares him. Most people do! But now that his cousin Clay has taught him how to overcome his fears all on his own, Jack is ready to take on the world! And with the Magic Finger Countdown, you will be too! Scaredies Away demonstrates a simple and effective technique called the Magic Finger Countdown which is rooted in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. The technique is used for conquering fear in almost any situation-from staying in a big kid bed at night, to imaginary monsters in the closet, to talking in front of a group. Children do not have to live with debilitating fear and anxiety. Behavior can be changed, and anxiety can be transformed into a sense of personal power. Read this book with your children or students, explore the Afterword for tips on implementing the technique, and encourage children to try the Magic Finger Countdown in any situation where they feel afraid.#1BESTSELLER in its category!See rave 5 STARS reviews at amazon.com!Go to amazon.com and get your paperback or kindle edition today!",
