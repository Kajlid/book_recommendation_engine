  "description": "When the Waldens move to Templewood, teenagers Emily and Peter find that leaving the City for 'a quieter life in the country' is the least of their problems. Bubbling beneath the surface of their new home are challenges that could change their world forever ...and end ours. Templewood is so isolated it is not on the map and has no communications links with the outside world. The village is home to the Sect, a divided organisation planning an apocalyptic event intended to establish world domination, but which may destroy the planet. Emily and Peter's arrival is no accident; their parents may know more than they admit. Could Peter really hold the key to trigger a world-changing event? One by one, mysteries are uncovered, until the terrifying objective of the Sect becomes clear. There is little time in which to find who is responsible. How far will they go? Should they be stopped? Can they be stopped? If you were the only ones who could save the world, where would you start? Who would you trust? '1984 Meets the Book of Revelation'",
