  "description": "Riley Aylworth’s life has been completely devoid of intimate contact since a fire left him with horrific facial scarring, so when he finds an ad for a phone sex service, he decides to give it a call. Except that the number is not a phone sex service—it’s the revenge Cameron Kirkwood’s ex-boyfriend took on him after an acrimonious split. Needless to say, Cameron is at the end of his tether and ends up yelling at his fortieth caller. What he doesn’t expect is for Riley to hit redial and yell right back.The yelling is cathartic for both of them, and the pair end up talking. Cam explains how he landed in this bizarre situation, encouraged by Riley’s understanding and calming tones, and they continue their conversations long after Cam changes his number. From this decision springs a friendship that, over time, grows into a gentle romance—all over the phone, because Riley is too scared to meet Cam in person. Showing a potential boyfriend his disfigured face is the fastest way to get rejected, right?",
