  "description": "Joel Fletcher, a lowly cab driver in Kalamazoo, finds himself neck deep in danger as an old friend of his father brings with him news that Joel is one of only four people left in the world who have the ability to consciously have an out-of-body experience. Unfortunately for Joel and the other Oobers, an evil and powerful entity from the Etheric Plane - Brakin - is Hell-bent on slaughtering the unsuspecting citizens of Earth like sheep, and they are the only ones that can stop him. As the depraved entity begins an all out war against the Oobers, Joel learns quickly that he is a babe in the cradle, and the bogeyman is right outside his door. It is time to somehow survive as death and destruction reduces his world to nothing, and he finds there is absolutely no where to run. War has been declared against mankind, and Joel is caught in the front lines.",
