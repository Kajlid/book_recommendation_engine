  "title": "Social Work for Fun and Profit: Social Work Satire 1982 - 1992",
  "description": "From the writer who brought you a social worker who solves murders (Death in Sioux Lookout) and a psychiatrist who turns into a gorilla to solve a case (The Love Duology) comes another completely original work. In the early eighties a young social worker named Richard Schwindt decided to do something never done before (or since) and satirize his profession. For ten years, writing in OAPSW Newsmagazine Schwindt regaled and horrified colleagues with classics like, \"Veterinary Social Work\", \"Social Work in Hell\" and \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, MSW\". These articles remain as edgy and funny now as when they were first published. Some pieces are fun; some are dark but all are unique and the output of an innovative mind.",
