  "title": "Psychology: 50 Essential Ideas",
  "description": "How do we learn? What is memory? How do we know how to behave?The formal study of psychology as a scientific enterprise began in Germany in the late 19th century but the observation of human behaviour dates back to Ancient Greece. Defined as the scientific study of behaviour and mental processes, psychology has attained a range of branches including clinical, cognitive, developmental, evolutionary, forensic, health and neuropsychology. In a wide ranging, highly illustrated book, readers are introduced to the world of psychology and those who formed the science as we know it.With discussion of a number of key ideas including prejudice and discrimination, social cognition, how we develop attitudes and why and how we fall in love, as well as reference to the people who developed these ideas, the book is an accessible guide to this fascinating subject.",
