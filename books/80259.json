  "description": "Rock gods, Disaster Hamsters, are on the verge of imploding. Egos, drinking, partying, groupies, they're all distractions from the real issue... her , the one that got away. And if they don't get their proverbial sh*t together, the band won't be hitting any charts. In fact, they'll be hitting the unemployment line. IslandFest is their last ditch effort to save themselves and the band. But when she shows up, danger nipping at her heels, will the guys be able to put everything aside to help or will they live up to their public personas as the bad boys of the rock scene? Rock stars. Girls. Drinks. And one week on an island. What could be better? Welcome to IslandFest, a seven-day rock and roll experience with dozens of bands from around the world, and over a hundred thousand fans. In the tropical heat, with gorgeous musicians and stunning beachgoers, things are bound to get sticky ... in more ways than one.",
