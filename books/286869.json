  "description": "Kickboxing instructor Grizz has been hiding his new hobby from his best friend Dylan because he knows she won't approve. After getting pummeled one night, he's forced to fess up the truth to her. When she comes over to patch him up, more emotional confessions tumble out and pretty soon these two are tangled up together in a spontaneous mattress-style wresting match.  Dylan can no longer deny her fantasy of getting pinned down by her best friend Grizz, the gentle giant who was there to teach her self defense when she ended a toxic relationship. She doesn't understand much about the world of mixed martial arts, and because of her family history, she's not sure if she can handle the stress of being the girlfriend of an MMA fighter. But Grizz will do whatever it takes to fight for their love.  Readers: this short, cute friends-to-lovers story is full of heat, banter and sweetness between two headstrong characters. HEA, no cheating, no cliffhanger, and only a mild bit of angst that is quickly resolved.  This story is meant for readers age 18 and up due to adult language and graphic sexual content.",
