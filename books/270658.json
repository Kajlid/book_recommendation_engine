  "description": "Not all officers are gentlemen —some are villains.Not all protectors care for your heart —some shatter it.He was all of that and more.One look at him and something inside of me woke from a three-year slumber.One realization and I knew I would never be able to unleash that desire.My world started to crumble. Fear crept in and I knew I needed Titan more than I could ever admit, or I could lose everything I had worked so hard for.Lines were crossed.Tragedy followed.We fell in love — in the cruelest of ways.",
