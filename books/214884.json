  "description": "The Wishing Well is part of a collection of childrenâ€™s stories (of the same name) that are very popular in the Lone City, particularly the Marsh. For Violet, it has always symbolized her father, as he used to read it to her when he would come home from work. The Wishing Well tells the tale of two sisters, gifted with one wish each after saving a water-spirit, and how those wishes change their lives.A deleted scene from The Jewel that was posted on Epic Reads!
