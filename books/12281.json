  "description": "One of the most-talked-about works of the 1920s, this compelling fantasy recounts the odyssey of a middle-aged pawnbroker who regains his youth for a year of amorous adventures. Jurgen's allegorical journey leads through a supernatural dreamscape to romances with Guenevere and The Lady of the Lake and confrontations with God and the Devil. This edition of Cabell's witty and irreverent landmark of modern fiction contains the full text of the revised and definitive version of 1926, together with 13 striking full-page illustrations by Frank Pap√©.",
