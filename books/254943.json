And then on January 7, 2017 everything changed when she saw a bigger-than-life vision of Jesus of Nazareth. That's when she walked away from her successful career, faced tremendous persecution and conspiracy theories written about her, lost her publishing house, and risked losing everything - so that she could follow Jesus and share the blessings that the Bible had brought into her life.In \"The Joy of Jesus,\" Doreen shares her personal experience with finally finding the joy and love she'd been seeking, and how Jesus completes our life and fills our heart in unmatched ways. You'll learn how to deal with spiritual warfare, battlefield of the mind, persecution, doubts and other struggles, so that you can find the joy of Jesus as well.",
