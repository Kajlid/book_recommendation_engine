  "description": "Print edition available from the Spiritual Instinct Press websiteKindle available on Amazon.From the Introduction:\"The history of alchemy is intimately tied to that of chemistry and many conventional scientific terms and operations came from the art. But there is also a deeper level of meaning beneath the surface, where psychological processes are represented by the material symbols. The action of turning base metal into gold can be read as an analogy; a road map for self-awareness and self-realization. This has been variously called enlightenment, wholeness, salvation, etc. It is this focus that is emphasized with the qualification: 'Spiritual Alchemy'.The present work is a modern rendering of some of the classic symbols and procedures into a unique working model for use by the contemporary magical practitioner.\"Working at the intersection of spiritual experience and depth psychology, this book is a practical resource to help you on your Journey back to your Soul.",
