  "description": "When Bree gets a job as personal chef to wealthy art dealer, Nick, she never expects to date him outside of her dreams. When Nick asks her to attend his art gallery opening, Bree can’t help but hope this is a real date, not just business. Adding a big dose of reality, Bree knows that the only reason Nick asked her is because Veronica is out of town. According to the tabloids, Veronica is everything Bree is not, wealthy, fashionable, and popular. So why would this be a real date? At the event, Bree is shocked to find that Nick has feelings for her too. Soon they’re in a whirlwind romance complete with a crumbling mansion, a cream puff fiasco, and mind blowing sex. Their lives intertwine, but they’re afraid to put their hearts on the line. Nick and Bree secretly wonder, do they both feel the same way? Or are their worlds just too far apart to find love together?",
