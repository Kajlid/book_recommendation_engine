  "description": "Jack is just sixteen. He has no one to turn to. He goes home with a stranger—and his life spirals out of control...A toxic affair, a cruel father, a mysteriously missing mother—and a brutal London winter. FOUR DARKS sends sixteen-year-old Jack on a perilous journey, exploring obsession, the will to survive, and the desperate wish to belong.On his birthday, in an effort to escape his sadistic father, Jack accepts the invitation of a man who he met just hours before. The much older James feels like the perfect present, a glimmer of hope at just the right time. But as Jack falls for him, a toxic game of courtship and rejection plunges him down a dangerous path.FOUR DARKS uncompromisingly chronicles the last days of a frigid December leading up to New Year’s Day, which is symbolic in many ways. Through Jack's unadulterated lens, it examines the tribulations, loneliness and isolation he suffers as he tries to come to grips with newfound emotions, while facing desperation, cruelty and fate.",
