The gang who’s rolled into town to do construction work in the area adds to her unease, especially when two of the handsome men set their sights on her. Kyle and West see forever when they look in Brandy’s eyes. They set out to woo her. Will she put aside her fear and give them a chance? She only has a few weeks left to make her decision before they move on to the next job. When someone uses Brandy as a pawn to stop the construction, Kyle and West must find her before it’s too late. Is it personal or is it business? For them, it’s very personal.",
