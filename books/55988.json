  "description": "This book will crawl inside your chest and pump lava through your blood. In her third poetry collection, Brandi L. Bates troubles the sound barrier where evolution and manifest destiny collide. These metamorphic poems praise life's bleeding by recognizing the wound. They live within the friction, the violent tensions created when the world's manifold and sometimes oppositional \"truths\" collide. Brandi L. Bates' incantatory poems build in yawps of collage that carve out the shape of her poems' heart-puncturing hurt. Bates finds hymn, epigram, ode, elegy, ballad, conversation, invective, confession, epitaph, inability, protest, love poem (praise, valentine, aubade, seduction, defense of inconstancy), riddle, cosmogony, theodicy, vanity, and misplaced concreteness. The souls of these poems have been put into them backwards. They unapologetically wear their wings on their chest, and all your hungry reading will not \"push / those wings / through / to the other side.\"",
