  "title": "Bite Hard",
  "description": "The first collection by award-winning performance artist/poet Justin Chin. In Bite Hard, poet Justin Chin explores his identity as an Asian, a gay man, an artist, and a lover. He rails against both his own life experiences and society's limitations and stereotypes with scathing humor, bare-bones honesty, and unblinking detail. Whether addressing \"what really goes on in the kitchen of Chinese restaurants\" or a series of ex-boyfriends, all named Michael, Chin displays his remarkable emotional range and voice as a poet.His raw, incantatory, stream-of-consciousness poems confront issues of race, desire, and loss with a compelling urgency that reflects his work as a performance artist, speaking directly to an audience. Throughout this collection, Chin showcases his ability to convey thought-provoking viewpoints on a variety of controversial subjects. As R. Zamora Linmark of Rolling the R's says, \"He plugs the stage microphone into the page and lyrically blasts the heart of our fears, rage, and import-export nightmarish dreams\".",
