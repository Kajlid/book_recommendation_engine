  "description": "Lost and floundering, searching for his true self, Maurice Darrell once found comfort in the church as a priest but left after discovering he no longer agreed with the church's philosophy. The church, however, never lost sight of Maurice because he'd once been one of their most powerful exorcists. When a prominent senator turns to the church to exorcise his son, the bishop asks Maurice to render an opinion.Prone to odd behavior, Tracy Ross baffles the mental health professionals. Upon seeing Tracy, Maurice isn't sure if Tracy's behavior is a result of demon possession or the young man's determination to rebel against an all-controlling and uncompromising father. Maurice has seen it all before, or has he?Romancing the Devil pits a defrocked priest against incredible evil, bringing a lost young man peace and, ultimately, love.",
