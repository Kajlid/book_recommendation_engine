  "description": "This book is designed to build upon Launching a Leadership Revolution and Leadership Tidbits and Treasures by not only reviewing timeless leadership principles, but by focusing them upon leadership as applied by the concepts of liberty and freedom, and specifically to winning back much of what has been lost in our lands. Our intent is that this book will not only inform and educate, but equip leaders both new and experienced alike, to make an increasing difference in the fight for the first principles of freedom. As Thomas Jefferson wrote, \"If a nation expects to be ignorant and free...it expects what never was and will never be.",
