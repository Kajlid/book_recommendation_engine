I was the Godmother, a savior for my people, and now under the Russian’s complete control—their bargaining chip.Nik was a beast, but so was I. He might have dismantled my life, but I would tear his to shreds. Let the games begin on who could be the most ruthless mafia leader. Unless my heart won out first.",
