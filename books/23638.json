  "description": "Quiet, reserved Daniel admits to being a \"serial monogamist\". He's holding out for a hero and waiting for his one and only. Someone who gets his jokes and has his back. Someone who's looking for forever. Ian, Daniel's closest friend, is...not a monogamist. He lives his life to the fullest in a whirlwind of whiskey, celebration, and seduction, falling in love at least once a week. No one can help falling in love with Ian when he turns his charm on them. Except Daniel. He'd do anything for Ian except get tangled up in the sheets or hearts. Everything changes when you mix friendship with romance. Take a chance on losing his best friend? No thanks. Ian? He thought he agreed, and he was looking forward to spending the rest of his life enthralled by discovering one new passion after another. Only somehow, when neither of them were looking, Daniel stole Ian's heart, and Ian stole Daniel's, tucking it in his pocket for safekeeping. Now he's pinning that heart on his sleeve and going after what he wants. Who he wants. Who he loves, and who he knows, deep down, has always been in love with him too. Not that it's exactly easy to change everything they thought they knew about themselves and each other, or to update their dreams. But they're both smart enough to know when you can and can't fight fate -- and to understand when someone who makes you laugh and shows you what love really means is something worth fighting for. Between you and me? Theirs is a love story that was only waiting to happen.",
