  "description": "Something is bothering Jane. Her little blue Chevette ended up at the bottom of Lake Winnebago years ago, but now the police are dragging it up. Jane just wants to move on with her life--stay sober, keep a job, maybe get her high school degree. She might make it. If only her mother would just encourage her. If only her therapist would stop making her face the past. If only her druggie teenage friends would stop showing up and trying to drag her back into the dark lake.",
