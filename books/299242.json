  "description": "From Wall Street Journal Best Selling Author, Willow Winters comes a steamy, small-town romance.A drunken bet that led to a fake relationship? My naive little heart still hoped it would last...We were never meant to be together. He’s a bartender with noncommittal tendencies. I’m looking for… the opposite. Commitment. Period.But drinks and a bet led to something it shouldn’t have: a fake relationship. Worse, a first date, a first kiss… and then more. He’s addictive and I can’t bring myself to accept the reality. That it’s all a lie and I’m fooling myself by thinking he could want more. That I could change him.He’s mine for as long as I keep on pretending like this is just for fun. As if I don’t want more… Like when he whispers my name, I pretend it doesn’t make my heart flip. Like when he holds me at night, I pretend I don’t want to lay in his bed every night.It's just a bet; just a lie... until it isn't.",
