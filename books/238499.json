  "description": "Charlie Cooper is the perfect package of sex appeal and silly goofball. Even better, he’s about to meet his match with the one woman who can see his true self behind all the humor…For Coop, filling the role of class clown always came easy. Making people laugh was second nature—growing up with four older sisters, a guy did what he had to do in order to get noticed—and he enjoyed putting smiles on his teammates’ faces. In the world of professional hockey, some guys filled the role of enforcer, some guys scored goals, and others, like Coop, provided the comic relief. Coop isn’t laughing when he meets the sexy new resident of Harlequin Hills. In fact, he’s a little smitten and a lot attracted to the smoldering carefree widow who has hair like a mermaid and curves like a goddess.And it’s here, in the arms of the most fascinating woman he’s ever met, that Coop will finally have a chance to prove that cracking jokes isn’t the only thing he’s good at…",
