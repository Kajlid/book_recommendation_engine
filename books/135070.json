  "description": "After years of alienation in her small town, Violet is finally getting out. Equipped with a can-do attitude and a fondness for silver linings, she’s determined to reunite with her older sister, Mel, who left to go “find herself” nearly a decade ago. Easier said than done. Mel’s new upscale life is a far cry from the way they grew up, and her sister’s entitled, self-important whatever-he-is doesn’t help matters—especially when Landon Blair seems more content to glower and grimace than roll out the welcome wagon.Though Violet tries to see the best in Landon, it’s difficult. He makes little effort to hide his aversion to her unyielding optimism, and she finds his arrogance and his ego kind of offensive. She is confident, though, that with her people-pleasing nature and ability to befriend anyone, she can navigate this new world of wealth, reconnect with Mel, and win over Landon in no time.But the longer she spends in their lives, the more secrets she uncovers, and she suddenly finds herself in the last place she ever wanted to be…smack dab in the middle of their turbulent relationship. When new discoveries about the past threaten her idealistic views, her confidence, and her entire reality, she finds an ally in the most unlikely person. The question is, can she really trust Landon, or will he destroy her (and her heart) altogether?",
