  "description": "After a diphtheria epidemic takes the lives of both her husband and daughter, Lily Nolan continues her work in a traveling medicine show. When the troupe arrives in the small town of Hope, KS, in 1866, Lily encounters Elijah Book, a preacher caring for an orphaned baby, and agrees to look after the child. Although attracted to the kindly Elijah, Lily distrusts him because of the childhood abuse she suffered at the hands of her preacher father. Handling the plot line concerning Lily's father with intelligence and compassion, Palmer (Prairie Fire, LJ 11/1/98) accomplishes a fairly rare task for the genre here, providing both fully rounded characters and unpleasant portrayals of clergy. Her solid development of Lily puts this prairie romance a step above most others, making this a fine addition to the entertaining series.",
