  "description": "New from the author of The Girl's Guide to (Man) Hunting! Beth Ann needed a hero. Beth Ann Williamson is done with her on-again, off-again fiancé. The problem? No one in her small town believes that it’s really over. Beth Ann is determined to show Bluebonnet, Texas, that she can take care of herself. But her plans go awry when she gets stranded in the woods and has to be saved by a handsome, if scowling, Marine. She got more than she bargained for. Survivalist Colt Waggoner is not pleased when he’s sent to rescue the pampered princess, and he’s even more annoyed when Beth Ann isn’t grateful for his help. He decides to teach the sexy blonde a lesson—a weekend alone in the wild. Just the two of them, in muddy, wet clothing that needs to come off… But Beth Ann is not as spoiled as he thought. And when she propositions him for a one-night stand, he knows he should turn it down, because this alpha male might need more than one night to satisfy him…",
