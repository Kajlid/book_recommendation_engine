  "description": "She stole my birthright, so I’ll claim her by any means possible.  I was banished from my family two years ago by my Pakhan and brother, and any mention of the Belyaevs makes me burn with red-hot anger. I’m no longer heir to the Belyaev crime family fortune. But she is. Zenya Belyaev, the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen. She’s the mirror of my soul. The second half of my treacherous heart. The key to my future as the most powerful man in the city. Our love is forbidden fruit. Zenya burns from the shame of wanting me, but I will sink my teeth into her heart and make her lick the juice from my lips. She thinks one taste is enough for me after wanting her all these years? Princess, I’m only just getting started. Author’s note: Brutal Conquest is a standalone MF romance with forbidden themes, breeding, an eighteen year age gap, a jealous and possessive alphahole uncle (no blood relation) and a sweet but strong virgin heroine. The story is dirty and delicious, so please read at your discretion.",
