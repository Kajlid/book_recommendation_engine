  "title": "Genghis Khan: The History of the World-Conqueror",
  "description": "This astonishing book, published in an updated edition with a new introduction and bibliography, is unquestionably the best and most authoritative account of the sudden rise and expansion of Mongol power in the 13th century. Considered one of the masterpieces of Persian prose literature, it traces the careers of Genghis Khan, who founded the Mongol Empire (1206 -- 27), and his three successors. Juvaini was in the service of the Mongol governors of Northern Persia and knew many of the chief actors in the dramatic story he told. In writing he was able to draw on the recollections of his father and grandfather who had also been involved with the Mongol Empire. Juvaini himself was intimately connected with one of the most interesting episodes, the destruction of the headquarters of the Assassins at Alamut.\"One of the principal sources for the history of the Mongol Empire and of Mongol Persia in particular\". -- Peter Jackson, Keele University",
