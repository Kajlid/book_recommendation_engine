  "description": "Me: Lucas Swain: I'm nearly sixteen years old and live in London. I was fairly normal until the night I found Violet. Then everything changed.   The Missing: Dad. He disappeared five years ago. Nobody knows what happened to him, and nobody cares except me. It's enough to drive you crazy.   The Dead: That's Violet . . . in the urn. Speaking of crazy, I know she's trying to tell me something, and I think it's about my father. . . .   A dead lady may not be much to go on, but my dad's out there somewhere, and it's up to me to find out where.",
