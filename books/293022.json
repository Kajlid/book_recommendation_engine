But since being sucked through a Reality Vortex to the mysterious Level 31, Dave and his friends are really struggling to be the muscle-for-hire which is the only way they know to earn a living.Now they have one last chance: rescue a princess from a tower, or fail to make their rent, and face eviction and probably involuntary enrolment in a less-than-pleasant brutal-fighting-pit scenario.But how can a man - even a spartan - compete with orcs and goblins, chimeras and cockatrice?Dave might have an idea, though he doesn’t think his friends will like it…This is the first of three stand-alone but linked comic fantasy novellas charting the fortunes of The Hard Blokes of Sparta.",
