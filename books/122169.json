More calamities ensue when Doreen and her husband Charles return from a riding course in the Scottish wilderness and Solomon thinks they have brought the Loch Ness Monster home with them. Then Sheba baffles her owners with a series of mysterious disappearances. What with Annabel adopting a cat of her own, Charles taking up the piano, Father Adams' flying hat, and Solomon's determined efforts to catch a hare, there are endless adventures in store in this loveable, witty classic.",
