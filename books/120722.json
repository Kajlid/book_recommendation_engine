  "description": "For the first time, curl up and enjoy all three Forbidden tales between two covers... First came the story of Chloe, whose parents leave her home alone for her last summer before college, in order to do some \"growing up.\" Little do they suspect that her aunt's impossibly sexy ex might transform those months into one long SUMMER OF SIN, letting Chloe grow up in an altogether unexpected way... Next we experience Alexa's holiday homecoming, one she sorely needs with her dad and his wife Eleanor. But when Eleanor's son Ben decides to return for the weekend, too, Alexa is forced to confront him under the same roof at long last: Why does he hate her so much? GIVING THANKS answers that question and many more, showing just how thin the lines are between hatred and passion, and blood and water. Finally, Jillian finds herself FROZEN IN TIME when she escapes a bitter betrayal at the hands of her family. Her getaway to an old favourite retreat is interrupted when the mysterious Daniel arrives...and both are shocked when they learn who each other is, and just how they've both wound up snowed in at this remote cottage. All three novellas from the FRUIT OF THE FORBIDDEN TREE New Adult/Erotic Romance series have been collected here. Surrender yourself to the taboo...",
