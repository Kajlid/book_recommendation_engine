  "description": "Relaunch- New cover. 3000 more words. More Sex. More Crazy. Preview of \"Damon-Son of Adam and Eve\". Coming November 2020 My want for her—from the very beginning—had always been wicked, immoral, and frightening. The intensity of it scared even me, and nothing ever scared me. She made me feel for the first time in my life. For a man like me, that was terrifying, but it was also fucking exhilarating. I spent so much time watching her that soon, my want turned into need, and then obsession. From there, it developed into full-blown addiction. She became all that I thought of. If I was a better, less selfish man, I would have forced myself to stay away from her. We were from two different worlds; one light, one dark. I knew the darkness of my world would inevitably swallow her whole. But I couldn’t let her go. I wouldn’t even lie and say I’d tried. I hadn’t, because every fiber of my being screamed that Eve was mine. She was meant for me. I could live without her, but I didn’t want to. I was rational enough to know that she wasn’t ready for me though. She was too naïve, too innocent, too young. I’d break her. So, in silence, I’d suffered. Watching, wanting, waiting and needing only her. She was always right within my reach, but never close enough to touch. Until… I took her.",
