  "description": "Although Jar of Hearts is the sequel to Glow, it can be read as a stand alone. My life is better off when I am alone. That way I can't ruin anyone's life but my own. Well, that is what Maria Anderson believes anyway, especially after what happened two years ago. She is a player- dates wealthy handsome men, comes and goes as she pleases without a worry in the world, and sleeps around. To Maria, she is just one of the guys. When her Manhattan apartment floods due to the neighbor's beastly dog above her, it leaves her no choice but to stay with her best friend, Vanessa Montello which so happens to also be her boss at Glow magazine and Vanessa's fianc√© Ben until she can find another apartment. Little does Maria know that staying with Vanessa and Ben rips the frayed Band-Aid revealing a fresh wound from two years ago. That wound being Ethan Montello, the extremely gorgeous brother to Vanessa that was highly off limits. Take Maria, Keith, Marc, Ethan, an erratic best friend/boss, an extremely annoying yet childish Benjamin McGurthy and what do we have? Maria's turn... her turn for her very own HOT MESS!*** Mature content, 18+***",
