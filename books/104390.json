  "description": "Does seeing the future mean you may have a chance to change it? For Francesca Munro, a successful artist in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, that is a question that plagues her daily thoughts. For years she's kept her psychic abilities a secret but when a murder she's dreamt of actually occurs—and then another—her struggle to cope with the deadly visions may be exposed. Francesca knows that there is a deeper meaning to the murders, one that may be connected to her—especially when she begins to receive bizarre and cryptic clues that send her catapulting into a search for the truth about her mother who committed suicide twelve years earlier. As Francesca tries to figure out how the past she barely remembers, yet is so desperate to forget, is connected to the killings, the body count rises. Delaware State Police Homicide Detective Jack Remington tries to unravel the intricate knot that ties the victims to Francesca. But can Jack solve the mystery before Francesca becomes the final piece in a twisted killer's one-man show?",
