Liv Spyers hits the big time when she lands a photography assignment with Grammy Award-winning pop star, the one and only Bisa. A huge fan, Liv is extra thrilled that her new boyfriend, Harry, will escort her to the glamorous premiere of Bisa’s debut movie. But when Bisa’s estranged sister, Courtney, threatens to turn the photo-op into a PR disaster, Liv goes after her—only to turn to camera lens on herself when Courtney winds up dead. With all eyes on Liv, her star-studded career is suddenly on the verge of being cancelled . . . Bisa is leaning hard on Liv to catch her sister’s killer—while she and her flirtatious entourage are wreaking havoc on Liv’s relationship with Harry. Now the best Liv can hope for is that her most famous photo doesn’t turn out to be her own mugshot. And that she can save herself—and Harry—before the killer strikes again . . .",
