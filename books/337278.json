  "description": "\"Youngsters are sure to delight in the exploits of this butter-loving pig, savoring the 'wonky in the extreme' text and energetic, innocent art.\" -School Library Journal Some may find it wonky to take a pig to the drive-in. But not the Watsons, who think the movie's title, When Pigs Fly, is inspirational. And not their beloved Mercy, who is inspired by the scent of real butter from the theater's Bottomless Buckets of popcorn. As they pull up in their convertible, Mercy lifts up her snout and becomes a pig on a mission, leading a delirious chase that's trailed by hapless rescuers reunited from Mercy's earlier adventures.",
