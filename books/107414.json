  "description": "Have you ever met a man that made you act foolish? You are in good company. Let me tell you the story of the most ridiculous relationship ever.I was a free spirited gypsy. I needed no man. I had my crazy cousin to fill my days. We drank until we couldn't stand. We drove people insane. We were inseparable and damned with nearly the same name, Melanie Moore and Melissa Moore. Here's the secret, we weren't really cousins!Then, she moved away. At first I wasn't sure how I was going to keep myself busy. I did the rational thing and started to plot my life around a man who didn't even know I was alive. Our paths crossing again depended on one thing: tomatoes.Julio was a crew leader for a tomato harvesting company. I would have to cross my fingers and pray he would return the following summer. He was so mesmerizing, I wasn't even sure I could look him in the eye. A mutual friend was sure he could make the match.The obsession became unhealthy, as most are. Before you could say cherry tomato, I lived in a fantasy world that I would indeed love, marry and copulate with Julio. I was going to be his reason for getting up in the morning, his reason for living.If I only knew then what I know now, I would have checked myself into the psych ward.Come join me for some Coronas, a few shots of tequila and a wild time following an irresistible man.",
