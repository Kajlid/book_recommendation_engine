  "description": "NOT A STAND ALONE! Please Read Rebel Lexis (Rings of Polaris Book 1) & Giants of Mars (Rings of Polaris Book 2) Paul Alan’s third volume in the celebrated new ‘Rings of Polaris’ series fuses sci-fi, dystopian fiction, and action – in an adventure giving Arthur C. Clarke a run for his money. While nobody will deny science fiction’s timeless popularity, both readers and critics are currently crying out for wholly-unique new narratives that don’t succumb to recycling of the “same old” concepts. Thankfully, Paul Alan has stepped up to the plate with gusto, serving up a compelling new series. Alan’s creation is rapidly building up a following among those who fell in love with Joseph Kosinski’s ‘Oblivion’ and the groundbreaking ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’. It’s easy to see why. “While of course rooted in science fiction, this series is deeply invested in the emotional side of its main players,” explains Alan. “Captain Bjorn is smitten with Rebel Lexis and finds it hard to refuse the suggestions of SOFIA – but when loyalties die, he’s left to fend for himself, he has to learn who he can trust, when he can trust them and if they can provide any hope for him staying alive. You won’t find anything as unique as this in any other novel out there.” Continuing, “I wanted to build on Arthur C. Clarke’s notion of a creative and mysterious AI computer system that, while exhibiting human emotions, can react in the most unlikely and unpredictable ways. I admit that I took a risk with this format, but initial feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.”",
