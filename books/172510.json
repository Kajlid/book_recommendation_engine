  "description": "Marianne Kowalski is simply trying to survive on what’s left of Earth after two years of invasions by the Tyranns. One night she spots an alien spaceship. When two men emerge, she hands them a letter explaining how to find her missing aunt and uncle. Marianne has nothing left on Earth, and only wants to rejoin the two people who raised her. But when she wakes up, she’s on Addo with Vaughn and River, two hulking alien men who inform her that her aunt and uncle have been taken prisoner by the Tyranns and are being held somewhere on Voyeur Moon. Marianne puts her IT skills to work helping the Addonians, but falling in love with Vaughn and River isn’t something she counted on.",
