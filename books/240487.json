  "description": "08/2019 :The Agent is already written. Just waiting for some editorial attention, but because the first two didn't do as well as the Hollows, there is great reluctance on the part of the big NY publishers to invest any time/money in them. I may self publish it, but I'm reluctant to go that way as it's even harder to get it to the publics eye that way.--Kim",
