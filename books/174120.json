  "title": "Rommel and His Art of War",
  "description": "Illustrated with 120 photographs Carries the reader from the Alps in WWI to North Africa in WWII With many photographs taken by Rommel himself In this compelling book, Rommel himself, one of the most successful commanders on World War II and certainly the most well-known, writes about his views on the philosophy of warfare, battles, leaders, and the progress of both World Wars. A complete picture of how a military genius grappled with the actuality of war is presented through Rommel's accounts of his experiences as a soldier in World War I, and through newly translated extracts from letters, orders and the narratives of daily action in World War II that he dictated every evening. Dr Pimlott's commentary sets Rommel's writing in context, describing the background to the great general's ideas and the way in which his plans were affected by circumstances beyond his control. The result is an outstanding insight into Rommel's military career, written from an objective viewpoint.",
