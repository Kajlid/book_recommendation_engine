  "title": "The Legacy of the Ninth",
  "description": "Packed with action, stacked with intrigue, and sprinkled with ingenious conspiracy, 'The Legacy of the Ninth' is a whirlwind thriller of bitter conflict and religious mystique, echoing through the centuries of time from the desert wastes of the Roman Empire to the luscious green valley of the Eden River and the land of the Lakes. Behold, the noble Domitian: A valiant Roman centurion who witnesses an appalling act of mass suicide in the Negev desert, and Hussein who plunders a Jewish artefact from its rightful owner. Centuries later Boyd, the detective, tries to find out why events in Masada are now so closely linked with nearby Hadrian's Wall. Indeed, against all the odds, Boyd realizes that the links are so strong that prospects of peace in the Middle East are in danger of collapsing. Things can't get any worse, can they?",
