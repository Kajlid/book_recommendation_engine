To Ben’s astonishment, the attacker is none other than Erica Hale, the spy-in-training he respects more than any other.His mission: prove Erica is not a double agent working against the US, locate the fabled colonial-era insurgent group that’s blackmailing her, figure out what their devious plot is, and thwart it.
