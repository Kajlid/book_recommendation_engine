  "description": "Sometimes love isn’t beautiful... Sometimes the only way to describe it is beautifully brutal.  If you think you know him… You’re wrong. If you think you know his family… Wrong again. If you think you know his story… You don’t.  If you did, you’d likely wonder how the hell a man like Maximillian Adorite managed to make it to this point in his life. At twenty-nine, he’s experienced more than most people could only ever imagine, all thanks to his family. Organized crime they call it. Mafia.  No matter how they spin it, it comes down to one thing. Max gets what he wants. Except for the one thing he wants most.  Her name is Courtney Kogan.  And now that he’s had a taste of her, Max knows he’ll never be able to let her go.  The Southern Boy Mafia series is a spinoff from the Sniper 1 Security series. It has been set up to be read without reading Sniper 1 Security, however, the characters will frequently cross over.",
