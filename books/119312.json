One day he stumbles upon the Tempest Freerunning Academy in L.A. Just for fun, he trains with an elite group of free runners. When his father lands the photography dream job of a lifetime, Cam finds himself landlocked in the middle of England without any friends or sunshine. His dad dumps him on the doorstep of Oxford's Prestige Academy where he learns to wear a tie for the first time in his life. His disregard for the rules places him at the top of the headmaster's naughty list. She's the least of his worries. Cam soon discovers his dad is really good at hiding something. A few weeks before opening night of his father's photography exhibit at the National Gallery, his dad disappears. When Cam secures a small package in his West End apartment, he is unaware the contents could kill him. He and his new friends must decipher a set of clues as they race through the streets of London, dodging bullets and bad guys. Cam uncovers a web of deception surrounding his father. But the ultimate trap has been set in motion long before Cam's existence. The one person who can face the danger, save his father, and live to tell about it, is the Free Runner.",
