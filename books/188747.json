  "description": "Sometimes the ways of God seem like Heiroglyphics.Sold by his brothers into slavery in a strange land, the pain in Joseph's ankles matched the pain in his heart. Where now was El Shaddai? But Jetur, the Ishmaelite merchant, saw something special in him. By prayerful diligence Joseph worked his way into the confidence of his new owner, Potiphar. \"At this rate, you'll be running the entire country before you are done,\" teased a scribe. Soon slaves were scrambling to meet his needs as he had for others.But heart-rending rumors from home, of the deaths of Er and Onan, of the affair of Judah and Tamar, exacted their toll. And success has its snares. Her name was Lady Tanefret. She had connections, and she had Potiphar. But it wasn't Potiphar she wanted.Based upon meticulous research, Fivash paints a compelling panorama of Egyptian society, with authentic Egyptian names, clothing, and customs, and draws us deeply into Josephs world. You will cheer as he maintains his integrity through prison and through the labyrinth of court intrigue to become ruler under Pharaoh. You will delight in his conquest of the heart of beautiful Asenath. And you will be left with a deeper faith in his God.The author creates a detailed picture of daily life in Egypt with a cast of nearly 80 vibrant characters. Her narrative, filled with fresh insights into one of the great stories of all time, unlocks the secrets of the culture that cradled the Exodus.",
