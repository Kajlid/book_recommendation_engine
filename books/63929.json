  "description": "The journey of self-discovery is a lifetime trip; and just like the fingerprints you possess, yours will be uniquely different than anyone else’s. There are things that are common in each—such as good and bad times, emotional highs and lows, and choices that will need to be made.These choices that are presented to you can greatly define how you live your life. They may be influenced by the people you meet, symbols that are strategically placed along your journey, and especially by your religious or spiritual choices. Being that no choice ever comes without consequence, there really is no right or wrong answer; the road taken will eventually get you to where you’re supposed to be. Although, some roads take longer than others in order for you to reach your ultimate goal.The sweetest thing about the life we live is that we all get to lead it differently. What’s right for one may be totally wrong for another; and while perception truly is your own reality, don’t forget there is always something more than meets the eye. You will be well served if you learn to see the whole picture before passing judgment on others, if at all.",
