  "description": "The ghost of a murdered child, a demon who doesn't know why he's on earth, and a man who can't forget his best friend even after twenty years.When the Seed rose from his grave, he knew he was not human.He also knew that he would not have a moment's peace unless he found the murderer of the child whose bones he was wearing.But as a newly blossomed demon, he still had much to learn. And, of course, no idea how to solve a twenty-year-old murder.The hunger that was gnawing at him also needed to be satisfied, and then there was that perfect, delicious-smelling Patrick.The Seed knew his desire for this man was dangerous, but it was harder than it should be to stay away from Patrick.This is the first book in the Hellflowers series, but it can be read as a standalone.",
