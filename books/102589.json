  "description": "Our lives are busy these days and sometimes we caught up in our day to day jobs and responsibilites. Often this is to the detriment of our personal relationships. Eventually we run the risk of taking our husbands, wives, boyfriends and girlfriends for granted and things fall into a rut. It’s never our intention for this to happen of course. When we start a relationship everything is blue skies and sunshine, our new significant other is the best thing in the world and we just can’t imagine not thinking about them 24 hours a day. However as time goes on and we settle into our routines, we find that we need to make more of an effort to keep the relationship on track and thriving. There’s nothing wrong or unusual about this, it’s just the way life can be sometimes.I wrote this little guide then, to try and provide a little inspiration and give a few ideas to those looking to keep your love lives thriving.Congratulations to you for making the effort to keep the excitement going. It’s not easy sometimes, but the rewards are definitely there if you put some time aside and apply just a little effort. I hope you find some great ideas in this book. Use the ideas as starting points and feel free to adapt them to your own situations and preferences. Remember that nothing is set in stone and the two of you are in charge of your journey together.",
