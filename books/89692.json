  "title": "Après Tennis: Tempting Treats to Bring to Socials, Mixers and Potlucks",
  "description": "Potlucks and socials are part of the tennis culture, but also, part of any group activity. It’s a fun and cooperative way to spend time together while sharing a meal and introducing friends to new and fun dishes. But any sport lends itself to sharing a meal together. You work up an appetite so why not get together and eat.Each recipe in Après Tennis has been modified to meet the challenges of early preparation, transportation, taste and presentation for a potluck party. Recipes are tailored to be prepared ahead of time with tips on what to pack, ways to present your dish and a photo of each recipe. Après Tennis offers 26 tested and true recipes. All the recipes were chosen because they are tasty, uncomplicated and have been modified to be transportable. Some recipes use prepared ingredients from the grocery store to save time, but can easily be altered by the gourmet cook. There are suggested options for altering the recipes to make them your own, but they are delicious just as stated. Each recipe comes with a serving tool reminder, variations or accompaniments to make each dish complete.",
