  "description": "I've been here before. I've done this before. At sixteen, Iburied my parents. At twenty-three, my fianc√© Bobby. And now, almost four years later, my husband Evan. I'm here again in the after. Here's what I know: death abducts the dying, but grief steals from those leftbehind. Tragedy. Heartbreak. A decade of loss defines her, but an illicit connection to a stranger saves her, yet leaves her questioning her past, her life, and herself, most of all.When she's at the precipice of her life, looking over the edge and seeing nothing, he saves her from herself. The connection between them stirs something inside that Julia thought she had lost long ago. Still, she questions her ability to start over and wonders if she can move on if it means letting go of her past--a past that seemingly still defines her. Please be advised that SEEING JULIA contains adult language and adult situations and is not appropriate for young readers. (Mature Young Adult/ New Adult/Adult Fiction)",
