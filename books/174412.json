  "description": "A raunchy, fictitious novel based on laughable true-life accounts, It's a Ball follows a team of eight misfit tennis players during the Austin League championship season and exposes the real country club tennis culture. Recreational tennis may sound like fun, but as they soon learn, the competition is a Molotov cocktail shaken with vodka and estrogen. Their underdog team must navigate the perils of contentious rivalries, cheating opponents, scandalous and backbiting rumors, and illegal shenanigans in a quest to become Queens of the Court. Along the way, they find that tennis is not all about balls, racquets, and team uniforms, but the special bonds between women. Campy and brash, It's a Ball is a story about unlikely victories on and off the tennis court.",
