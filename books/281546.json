  "description": "He can bring the heat, but she’s a curveball he never saw coming…\n  Hannah  My plan is sound: Fix the major league ballplayer’s PR crisis and ignore the annoying crush I have on the cocky jerk. I’ve had a front-row seat to how he conducts his personal life for years, and I want nothing to do with it—no matter how hot he is, or how weak he makes my knees. But my sound plan crumbles as I spend time with him and discover that maybe—just maybe—Jack Reagan’s more than a waste of handsome.  Jack  Baseball is my life. I don’t have time for unnecessary drama. So when my ex-girlfriend publishes a tell-all book, I know I need Hannah Adams. She’s worked PR magic for my team in the past, and I need all the help I can get to repair my reputation. Once the job’s done, all I’ll be left to figure out is…when did Hannah turn into a sexy-as-hell woman who makes me want things—forever kind of things—I never wanted from any other woman?  \nIt’s the bottom of the ninth. Will Hannah and Jack go deep, or strike out for good?",
