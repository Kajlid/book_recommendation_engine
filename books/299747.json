  "description": "Remember the last day of elementary school and that feeling of absolute bliss of not having to take your backpack to school? Do you ever find yourself chasing that feeling again as an adult? Remember what it was like to only be worried about your outfit for the next day and not bills and work? Well then look no further, because no book can give you that feeling again. But if you are looking for a book that can guide you to giving more structure to how you want to live your life, a book that asks you the important questions about life that college didnâ€™t think was important to ask, and a book that will help you build a strong character foundation, then look no further. Sincerely, Life: A Conversation to Find Yourself, is a 60-day guide to help you uncover what you want from life, no matter how much it may differ from the life society told you to want. At the end of the day, navigating life is scary. It comes with a lot of ups and downs and personal evolvement. But by the time you finish Sincerely, Life, hopefully, you will have a better understanding of who you are and what you want.",
