  "title": "Hidden from History: 300 Years of Women's Oppression and the Fight Against it",
  "description": "Hidden from History is a study of the changing position of women in England from the Puritan revolution to the 1930s. The author brings together a mass of material on birth control, abortion and and female sexuality; on the complex relationship of women's oppression and class exploitation; and on the attempts to fuse the struggles against these two.This book is a product of her involvement in the women's liberation movement. It concludes that feminist socialism is both urgent and possible but it depends on \"our capacity to relate to the working class and the action of working-class women in transforming women's liberation according to their needs.\" This is the first book Rowbotham has written as a socialist for a socialist publisher: Pluto Press.",
