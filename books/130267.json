  "description": "His voice is hoarse. “I am going to make love to you now.” He says, “So if you want me to stop, tell me.”  I shake my head frantically. If he stops at this point, I’ll probably die.  Sophie Bennett has virtually no experience with men. Orphaned from birth, she’s gone from living with her reclusive spinster aunt, to a sheltered education in boarding school. So nothing prepares her for David Preston. The intensely attractive business-man is entirely out of her league. Can she handle such a dangerous man, or is she in over her head?",
