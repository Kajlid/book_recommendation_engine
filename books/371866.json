  "description": "Ahmed is a poor orphan who lives with a travelling circus and works for cruel Madame Saleem. His life is changed forever when he finds a beautiful egg in the forest and brings it back to the circus. From the egg hatches a little girl called Aurelia, and as she grows she sprouts soft feathers that turn into wings. So Madame Saleem puts Aurelia in a cage to keep her as the top attraction at the circus. Ahmed knows he must free Aurelia, but when he does so Madame Saleem takes revenge and makes his life impossible. Is all hope lost for Ahmed? Then one night Aurelia comes to him in a dream and brings him a feather . . . Composed of dreams and memories — and packed with evocative full-color illustrations — this fantastic tale of magic, enchantment, and freedom is the latest triumph from a master storyteller and illustrator of children's books.",
