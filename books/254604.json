  "description": "My name is Bristol Mateo, and I am the tour manager for the #1 rock band, Cycle of Sin.It takes a lot to keep a band of five rockstars on schedule, but Iâ€™ve been doing it for just over two years now. As a new tour begins, I find myself confused over what happened after a night of partying between shows.The kiss from each of them is laced with enough power to destroy me, and my mind is riddled with guilt over the things I feel for them individually. Dean, Evan, Hunter, Sebastian, and Austin heat my body in ways that are deemed immoral. As we tour across the world, I find myself falling for each of them equally.When they vow their hearts to me as one, I realize I am meant to be loved by them all. I belong to Cycle of Sin, and Cycle of Sin belongs to me.***Warning...5 rockstars and 1 female...The possibilities are endless.",
