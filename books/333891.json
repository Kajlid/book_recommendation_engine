  "description": "My childhood best friend is a big, bad biker—and an animal in the bedroom.I should know because we’ve been hooking up in secret for weeks.We crossed a line we swore we’d never cross, but the lust we’d buried for years finally culminated in a night of heated passion.I know the taste of Duke’s lips, but this is more than just desire. When we’re together I see the promise of forever in his eyes.Duke is the only man who makes me feel safe enough to be vulnerable, but I’m terrified I’m going to screw it up and lose it all.He won’t stop until he has every piece of me, including my heart. He wants me on the back of his bike, my name inked on his skin.He wants me to be his Old Lady.He wants me pregnant.",
