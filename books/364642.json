  "description": "At 55, Rae Padilla Francoeur had no idea that the most deeply fulfilling sexual relationship she'd ever encounter was still to come. In her memoir, Free Fall , Francoeur discloses her discovery of a new love after nearly two decades in a relationship that wouldn't end, despite her need and desire to move on.  Francoeur succumbs entirely to the intensely physical and stimulating relationship she finds with this new man—allowing her body and mind to truly embrace pleasure and sexual desire—and shares intimate details of a love affair that changes everything, leading her to celebrate her sexuality and rediscover herself. Free fall , Francoeur says, is a Let go. Be here now. Open up to the possibilities.  Choosing to let go is a tall order for a woman who's lived her life as a single parent, a loving and attentive mate to a man with bipolar disorder, and a creative director in a busy museum—but when she finally succeeds in choosing herself, she views life anew, sensitized by sexual desire and dramatic change. Her new lover says, \"Everything is foreplay.\" With him, Francoeur learns to embrace her sexuality and the profound pleasure bodies bring, even as they age.",
