  "description": "Letters to Carol was written to make it easier for me to face my abusers, and to move on with my life. Glenda Bixler is indeed right. This book is a non-fiction memoir, a true life story of one woman's harrowing abuse .In Elementary School, during the late 60's classmates called me \"The Blob.\" At home, I was ridiculed by my mother, who imitated my looks to my siblings, while she disassociated me from my real name. With the early loss of my beloved grandmother, I had no protection from my brother's abuse which hurt me primarily on multiple levels. One day, inside my bedroom closet I developed dissociative identity disorder, better known as Multiple Personality Disorder. I began hugging myself, promising to develop protective mechanisms to help me deal with daily trauma. It also helped me tolerate cruel, insulting behaviors by believing I could rely on my alternate universe to help me soothe my inner pain. When I recognized how much better I felt, I could appropriate tolerance by relegating all my abuses to another part of my mind. Following a terrifying bout with homelessness, my last personality emerged to tell my story, proving forgiveness was the component that would ultimately put a rest to my trauma, to set me free. I am most honored to present to you Letters to Carol.",
