  "description": "This is the incredible untold story of the 1949-50 Indiana high school basketball season. It chronicles the wild circumstances that captured the essence of Hoosier hysteria in all its glory. But this is much more than just a sports story. It explores the life and times of the 40s and 50s. The students were born into the Great Depression and grew up in the shadow of World War II. The coaches were veterans of war. A fire destroyed a school, but its team kept on playing. A coal strike threatened everything. There were hard times and fond memories. But in the end, everyone shared one common love: basketball.",
