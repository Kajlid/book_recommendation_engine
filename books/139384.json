  "title": "The Ohio",
  "description": "Originally part of the Rivers of America Series, The Ohio traces the river from its headwaters in Pittsburgh to the point it empties into the Mississippi, nearly a thousand miles and five states later. The Ohio gives us a rare portrait of the frontier era of this region, from backwoods entertainment to learning and the arts. From early exploration to land disputes, clashes with Native American inhabitants to the birth of steamboat travel, the Ohio River comes alive through the retelling of the incidents and anecdotes that shaped its history of what the French called \"\"the beautiful river.\"",
