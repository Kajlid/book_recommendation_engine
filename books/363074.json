  "description": "It’s hard to figure out how it is that a plot so meticulously planned and beautifully executed could go so far off track! She’d researched everything carefully, planned it down to the smallest detail. All she had to do on her ‘skiing vacation’ at the lodge was make herself available, collect ‘donations’ and voile! Baby! A task easier plotted than done, she discovered. First, it seemed she couldn’t land even one. The next thing she knew, she had all three jockeying for position and then she discovered her ‘perfect donors’ had just a little flaw... Why the hell didn’t somebody tell her there really was such a thing as werewolves! That, she scolded herself, was what came of insufficient planning!",
