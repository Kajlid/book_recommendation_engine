  "description": "It's Picture Day and Lizzie McGuire's parents have pressured her into wearing the dorky sweater her grandmother gave her for Christmas. Lizzie loves her grandmother, but when she gets to school, her sweater makes the other kids laugh so hard that one of them actually squirts milk out of his nose. Not the fashion statement Lizzie was going for. Lizzie knows it's dumb to care about what other people think. Then again, does she really want to be remembered in the yearbook as The Girl in the Unicorn Sweater? At the last minute, Lizzie decides she has to change her clothes. If only she can come up with a plan...before three o' clock!",
