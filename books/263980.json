  "description": "Some rules are meant to be broken. Will breaking the ones that aren't cost them everything?Finding an American civilian in a cave in Syria was not part of his mission brief. Zenko Marks, former Navy SEAL and member of the JSOC Task Force, has no idea who the mysterious man is, but he knows one thing for sure: he’s never left a man behind and he’s not about to start now—particularly one who looks at him with those stunning eyes.Shaun Jacobson thought his number was up. Getting captured while undercover was never supposed to happen but getting rescued was a statistical impossibility, especially when he technically doesn’t exist on paper. The last thing he expected was a knight in shining Kevlar to ride in to save the day. Zenko is like no one he’s ever met before and while Shaun knows he should keep his distance he can’t help but want the man who rescued him from hell.Can covert agents from two of the United States’ most secret teams allow their hearts to rule or will a joint mission between the teams cost them everything, their brothers and, worst of all, each other?",
