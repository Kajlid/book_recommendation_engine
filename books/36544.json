  "description": "In 1926, and keeping with the Lattimer tradition, thirteen year old David is gifted to hunt the Christmas Goose. He sets off with his ten year old sister Rose, reminded by his Father—be back by sundown.But when David and Rose stumble between a Mother Bear and her cubs, they escape her rage and climb high in a tree. Turning this historic day to one of terror as the sun sets, the temperature drops and snow arrives. David must protect his sister, and keep his wits about him when the angry Mother Bear refuses to leave, and David clings to what his Father taught him, worried if their Father will find them or they’ll spend a night freezing deep in the forest, trapped in a tree.",
