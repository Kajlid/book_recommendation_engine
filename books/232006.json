She’s the new kid in the precinct and not everybody’s happy about her landing this case, but that won’t stop her from solving it. All she needs is a good partner and she’s golden. Detective Jayson Rivers is an asset to the gang unit, but when the murders start encroaching on his territory, he agrees to partner up with Mellina to help get this case solved. Although his hands are full with his daughter at home, it doesn’t mean he can keep them off of Mellina. Long days and late nights keep these too in close proximity, fanning flames of lust that just won’t die down. Can they catch the murderer in time, and keep their hearts in tact?",
