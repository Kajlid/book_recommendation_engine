  "description": "Librarian Charlie Jules really needs to stop falling for straight guys. Every man he’s been attracted to over the past year has turned out to be straight—including Scott, a cute new library patron who comes complete with an adorable puppy.  Charlie was almost ready to give up on ever finding love in Hope Springs, but when Scott kisses him…  ... twice…  … he starts to realise that the gorgeous man of his dreams might not be as straight as he thinks he is. Is there hope for the two of them?  After uprooting his life and moving to Hope Springs to finally pursue his dream of becoming a veterinarian, Scott still feels lost in his new hometown. He doesn’t really fit in at work and his classmates are all younger than him, so all he has for company is his small pack of foster dogs. That is, until he meets Charlie.  Charlie isn’t like anyone Scott’s ever met.  He’s never wanted to kiss another man before.  What the hell is he supposed to do now?  Checked Out is the second gay romance in The Family Jules series, but it can be read alone.  It does not contain a cliffhanger, but it does contain a puppy called Chewie, a kiss that Charlie totally didn’t start, a kiss that Scott totally didn’t start, a sweater with a hole in the sleeve, explicit sex scenes, the entire Jules family in one room, and a happily-ever-after ending.",
