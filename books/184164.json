  "description": "The Story of We is every person's story—about the beauty of life, the unplanned pursuit of a dream and the resilience of love. He had a farm and dreams in Africa, but after tragedy strikes, everything crumbles. Nothing seems sure anymore—even his trust in God. He sets off for America, an unfamiliar country where he didn't even speak the language. With two young daughters and all they possessed in four suitcases, the three of them arrive in America with only hope. There, they encounter angels in human form of all colors and kinds who cross their paths one by one, bringing them to an unexpected destiny that far surpasses his greatest hopes. The power of three—three dreams and three hearts—weaves a story of simple pleasures, everlasting hope and surprising candor that will encourage and inspire. Only in America.",
