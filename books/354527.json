  "title": "Compartments: How the Brightest, Best Trained, and Most Caring People Can Make Judgments That are Completely and Utterly Wrong",
  "description": "\"Dr. Steven Feldman has written an extraordinary book. Provocative and often brilliant, Dr. Feldman has examined his own thinking and that of the medical profession in general, critically looking for patterns of misunderstanding between medical specialties and between physicians and others concerned with public health. Dr. Feldman courageously applies his paradigm of conceptual \"compartments\" beyond medicine to contemporary political conflicts, searching for new, more hopeful and productive ways of engaging with previously intractable conflicts. Regardless of occupational or political loyalties, all will benefit from reading 'Compartments' . Dr. Feldman's book contains many stimulating ideas, an unflagging idealism, a willingness to question received wisdom and the potential to shock readers into thinking outside the box of his or her own 'compartment'.\"-Michael Sugrue, Ph.D.Professor of History and Chairman of the History Department, Ave Maria University",
