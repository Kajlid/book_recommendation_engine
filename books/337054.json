  "description": "True Blue tales of clever and courageous canines. Some say Australia was built on the sheep’ s back, but it is just as true to say our great nation was built in the dog kennel. Australians love their dogs — we collectively own more than four million pet pooches — and they love us right back. In fact, Aussie dogs’ loyalty to their owners knows no bounds. That’ s why our faithful four-legged friends have saved us from peril, inspired works of art, offered unwavering loyalty and even seen harmful laws changed for their own kind. In AMAZING AUSSIE DOGS, Laura Greaves brings to life the inspirational true stories of homegrown heroes who have made headlines worldwide for being the best boys and girls Down Under.",
