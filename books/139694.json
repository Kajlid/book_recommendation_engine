  "description": "Robin does another deep dive into her psyche to augment her powers and extend her outreach to the Renaissance types she's tracking. Using Zen and various esoteric meditative techniques few have mastered in the last three thousand years, she makes huge inroads. But the formula proves highly combustible. Meanwhile, the powers of the Renaissance types themselves quickly reach the level where the entire planet is threatened. And Robin herself comes under direct attack.",
