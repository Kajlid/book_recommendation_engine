  "description": "Deacon: Tonight is the night I begin the Claiming ritual with Elijah. He's still trying to pretend that he doesn't have feelings for me, and he's being quite mouthy about it. But all of that will end with a little discipline.  Noel: I've learned so much training with Marco, I thought I could fight,but he's showing me what true fighting really is. I just hope I can survive his lessons.  Theoden: Dante, my stubborn son, will needs a serious attitude adjustment and no one is better equipped to do that than me. I'm going to beat him into submission until he understands who his Master really is.  Warning: This serial contains strong adult content not meant for sensitive eyes. The novelettes in this serial will be filled with dark, twisted, raunchy and steamy scenes between powerful, sexy men that will either offend you or get ya revved up. This series will not be pulling any punches, and it won’t apologize for hurting your feelings, either. You’ll find no fluff and ruffles here. The vampires are not misunderstood, hopeless romantics looking for love. The werewolves are not cute and cuddly and the dragons aren’t the ones from your childhood. This is NOT a romance. There are approximately 34000 words in this novelette.",
