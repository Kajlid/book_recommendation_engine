  "description": "The plan was simple; snatch the child and get the ransom money. They had found their victim; a young boy from a posh school. They had done their homework; he came from a wealthy family who'd surely pay the earth to get him back.They had even justified why they were right in carrying out such an act; they had served their time and both felt as though they were being cheated from what was owed to them by the cruel society they were trying to integrate with. This was their plan and their time to put themselves on the straight and narrow. It was just a shame that no one told them......They never stood a chance.From Matt Shaw the author of 'The Cabin', 'The Lost Son' and 'The Infestation'. Expect twists, turns and unexpected friendships in this horror - you'll still never see them coming.",
