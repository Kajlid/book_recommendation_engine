Put out that he is so wrapped up in his new bride, Vesta accompanies her godmother, Diana, to town where she meets and falls instantly in love with the gallant Captain Hewett DeVere. \"Hew\" DeVere, younger brother to Viscount Ludovic \"The Devil\" DeVere, has returned from the war with plans of selling his commission and settling down. He quickly becomes enamored of the older but beautiful Diana, and barely notices eighteen-year-old Vesta. When Hew fails to respond to her feminine charms, Vesta takes extreme measures to capture the object of her desire, but Hew didn't survive the worst of the war only to succumb to Vesta's wayward wiles. \"You conniving creature! How can you possibly think I could ever love such a spoiled, petulant, self-absorbed, and scheming little wretch?\"Proving the adage that opposites attract, this hilarious romp pits the would-be huntress against the gallant hero in an epic war of wills.
