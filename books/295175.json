  "description": "They say history repeats itself. We’ve got a lot of work to do to end up on the right side of it after Election Day 2020. This curated selection of columns is quintessential for any Ben Shapiro fan or skeptic. He offers a sharp, insightful reflection on American politics and culture over the last few years. Between elites who just can’t get down from their soapboxes, the left’s “thought fascism,” the rampant media, and more, the nation is in trouble. And if conservatives don’t act fast, they’ll get what they deserve . . .",
