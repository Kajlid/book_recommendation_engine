  "title": "A Paper Mask",
  "description": "A nailbiting thriller in the tradition of \"Ripley's Game\". Hospital orderly Matthew Harris is every bit as smart as the junior doctors he works alongside. He's also trapped, bored, ambitious and ruthless. When a medical intern dies, Matthew assumes his identity and takes the dead man's next job, on the far side of the country, as a junior Emergency Room physician. As the deception starts to unravel, the young nurse who falls for him is the one person standing between the newly-minted bogus doctor and the exposure of his lethal charade.",
