  "title": "The War Ahead - Part II",
  "description": "Josh and Zekeâ€™s penchant for adventure, passion for love, and a monumental fear for their lives, have caused them to flee the family plantation in coastal South Carolina with no destination in mind only a direction, to head west to live on the frontier in a land where no one knows who they are. Lacking experience in a wilderness life, and having little knowledge of dealing with and defending themselves from the highly experienced Indian warriors, they willingly leave their eastern civilization in hopes of finding a place so remote, they could finally be alone to allow their relationship to grow. Only the power of their love gives each boy the strength, determination, and fortitude to endure all the wilderness could fling in their faces. Their life and love inspire new friends as they often use their skills learned in war to put their lives on the line to help total strangers survive as well. Revised 2010 for editing and setting up new sequel Part III War Beyond.",
