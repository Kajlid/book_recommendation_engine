  "description": "A SPECTACULAR COLLECTION OF IMAGES AND WORDS THAT OFFER A DETAILED GLIMPSE INTO THE UNIQUE BEAUTY AND RHYTHM OF AFRICA’S NATURAL WONDER. Mount Kilimanjaro is the African continent’s highest mountain and the world’s tallest freestanding mountain. It is a geological wonder formed, sculpted, and molded by the natural forces of volcanic fire and glacial ice. At 19,340 feet (5895 meters) high, Kilimanjaro towers above the Great Rift Valley and lies 3 degrees south of the equator, on the northern border of Tanzania, close to southeast Kenya. Kilimanjaro is an accessible mountain that one can climb without the help of any technical equipment. The ascent starts from the cultivated lower slopes with dry blistering heat, through a lush, wet rainforest jungle, into heath and moorland zones, all the way up to the desolate alpine desert landscape and the steep, exposed arctic summit area, where one will experience breathtaking views of the legendary snows of Kilimanjaro. Moushabeck and Schulz invite you along as they explore and climb Mount Kilimanjaro. In this book they capture the essence of this majestic mountain with over 200 full-color photographs and an engaging and entertaining narrative that smoothly ties together personal observations with the mountain’s history, its people, and its ecology.",
