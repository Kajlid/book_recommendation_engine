  "description": "She is the one wolf who can tame his feral spirit.A Northern Shifters story.A year and a half ago, if someone had told Zach that he'd be guardian to the creature he distrusts most--a wolf shifter--he'd have laughed. A half-broken horse shifter as father figure? No way.Now, he'd kill to protect the pup he found lost in the woods--and he has. Which, unfortunately, has attracted the attention of Wolf Town's alpha.Sally prefers to keep a low profile among her fellow shifters in Wolf Town. Yet when she's asked to investigate a pup living outside the safety of the pack, she can't bring herself to refuse.From the moment Zach meets the new piano teacher, his world tilts. Her scent gets under his skin. Her touch retrieves missing pieces of his memory. But even as their attraction flares out of control, trust is the hardest to give, and the one thing they both need if they're to save the boy from another attack.Be advised, the protective shifters may cause you to want to move to Wolf Town.",
