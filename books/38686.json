  "title": "Tried, Tested & Being Approved: The Ernie Berry Story",
  "description": "In this autobiography, Ernie Berry speaks candidly of the physical, psychological, and emotional issues involved in living with and overcoming two acute debilitating handicaps. This story is an account in which reality is truly stranger and more exciting than fiction. Ernie describes in vivid detail what it is like living with blindness and a painful neurological deficiency, and walks the reader through his life's story, explaining the motivating factors driving him to achieve great things. Despite his adversities, Ernie has read more than 2,500 books, won chess tournaments, placed in weightlifting competitions, hosted a radio talk show, worked in Washington, DC, graduated with a master's degree, and earned two postgraduate certificates. This book is intended to inspire, encourage, and edify readers in all situations by relaying the message that overwhelming success can be achieved when people are driven by goals and dreams that they cannot achieve through their own efforts.",
