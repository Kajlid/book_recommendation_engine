  "title": "The Great Southern Circus",
  "description": "With the Civil War rapidly closing in, the performers of a small horse drawn circus traverse the southeastern United States in a tour that began in 1859.During the next twenty eight months they would set up in more than 300 towns in sixteen states, performing six hundred and ninety three shows.Traveling on unpaved and poorly marked roads, braving bad weather and outlaws, this is the true story of one circus family that made that tour.At once a love story and great adventure, this is the story of a six thousand mile adventure, and the long road home.",
