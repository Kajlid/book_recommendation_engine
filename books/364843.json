  "description": "Mayan lore and modern science warn that 12/21/2012 could bring a global cataclysm—a threat that is far more real than we imagine. Dark forces stand poised to crush mankind beneath a vicious rule of terror and blood sacrifice. Our only hope rests with a group living in secret among us: modern magic wielders called the Nightkeepers.Trained from birth to fight with fists and magic, Patience White-Eagle knows that she should focus on the coming war for souls. But she isn’t just a warrior—she’s a wife and mother too, which leaves her loyalties divided between the Nightkeepers and her family.Brandt White-Eagle broke the rules when he married Patience and fathered their twin sons—and now he’s paying the price. Torn between his magic and his marriage, and separated from his ancestors’ wisdom by a curse he can’t remove, Brandt is fighting to put his life back together.When an ancient Aztec god-king arises, Patience and Brandt must set aside their problems and team up as a mated warrior pair. But as they race to prevent the Nightkeepers’ enemies from enacting a terrible ritual that could tear apart humanity, the threat turns even more personal, becoming a deadly test of their powers…and their love.",
