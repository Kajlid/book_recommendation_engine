  "description": "Bored with the ordinary, mundane, work-a-day world? Tired of the same old routine? Then toss your cap over the windmill and meet Katherine Maclean. It's an experience you'll never forget.Through her artistry and imagination you'll soar through space, you'll touch the stars, you'll bask in the glow of other suns... and you will be one with:The long-legged lawyer who suspected that he was a Martian; the boy who became all the characters in his make-believe games; the sewing-circle ladies who took over the world; the alien spacemen adrift in a raindrop; the woman who discovered the terrible secret of immortality.There are other stories in this remarkable collection, but to merely describe them might give away their plots, and that, as every S-F fan knows, is a dastardly crime punishable by indefinite exile on mysterious, fog-shrouded Planet X!Contents:The Diploids (1953) novella.Defense Mechanism (1949) short story.The Pyramid in the Desert (1950) short story.The Snowball Effect (1952) short story.Incommunicado (1950) novelette.Feedback (1951) short story.Games (1953) short story.Pictures Don't Lie (1951) short story.",
