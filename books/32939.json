  "description": "Three deliciously sexy stories of sensual healers and their naughty patients....Gail FaulknerAfter years of illness, Lauren is desperate for a reprieve from her stiflingly protective family -- so she joins her best friend Carla for a weekend at her family's ranch. Although Carla warns the cool, collected Lauren about her womanizing cousin Romeo, when Lauren and Romeo first lock eyes, they feel undeniable passion for one another. Romeo knows he can have any women he desires, but now he longs only to care for this sexy little minx -- and has one short weekend to convince her to stay.Lisa Renee JonesShy and cautious physical therapist Kelly Marshall is all work and no play. Determined to go to medical school and avoid becoming like her recklessly irresponsible mother, she has always repressed her wildest and most sinful desires. That is, until she meets sexy architect Mark Majors and discovers a deeply sensual side she never knew she had. And when weeks later he appears in her exam room -- needing her healing touch -- she can't help but surrender, once again, to the passion blazing between them.Sahara KellyFor fiery redhead Susanna Chalmers, Dylan Sinclair was the handsome muscle-bound guy in high school she could never have. But eleven years later, now a relationship therapist, Susanna sees Dylan in one of her lectures -- and he reminds her of a steamy night after senior prom when he knew he wanted to have his way with her. As a doctor, Susanna knows he isn't relationship material. But as a woman, her extremely aroused body is telling her otherwise",
