  "description": "It was a debt of honor, but Lucas Brand didn’t have the time. Jessica Glen has her work cut out for her. Being thrust into the job of coaxing Lucas to honor his debt to Norman Roxbury is a task way above her pay grade. A man whose only passion is making money, he doesn’t deserve the title “Mr. Nice Guy.” In his world, people and relationships be damned. Yet, his stormy kisses reveal vulnerability and a yearning that both draws and frightens Jess. Against her will, she glimpses the caring man Mr. Roxbury wants to resurrect from the automaton Lucas Brand has become. She can't be foolish enough to go all weak in the knees for another type-A man, can she? Especially the very man responsible for the breakup of her parent’s marriage, and her own! She'd be a self-destructive idiot if she allowed herself to fall—so how can she be falling?",
