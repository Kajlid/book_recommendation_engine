  "description": "This is the hotel where our nightmares go...It's where horrors come to be themselves, and the dead pause to rest between worlds. Recently widowed and unemployed, Richard Carter finds a new job, and a new life for him and his daughter Serena, as manager of the mysterious Deadfall Hotel. Jacob Ascher, the caretaker, is there to show Richard the ropes, and to tell him the many rules and traditions, but from the beginning, their new world haunts and transforms them.It's a terrible place. As the seasons pass, the supernatural and the sublime become a part of life, as routine as a morning cup of coffee, but it's not safe, by any means. Deadfall Hotel is where Richard and Serena will rebuild the life that was taken from them...if it doesn't kill them first.Cover art by John Kenn Mortensen.",
