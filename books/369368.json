Let the clash of wills begin.Charleston blue blood Clayton Wilcott \"got religion\" late in life; so late, it turns out his kids never took to it. So he's left a provisional will delivered in a highly unorthodox way.Now they're going to have to honor Daddy's commandments from beyond the grave--for a full year--or be cut off from their substantial inheritances.The scent of wisteria lingers in the air as the four spoiled Wilcotts battle for their birthright. Told in Denise Hildreth's trademark blend of humor and heart, this Southern tale is about learning to love, learning to live, and learning to bend.",
