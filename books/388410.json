But when his best friend Lisa goes missing from the sunny California campus of PsyTrain, the last thing he wants to find there is her spirit.Disappearing without a trace in a school full of psychics? That's some trick. But somehow both Lisa and her roommate have vanished into thin air. A group of fanatics called Five Faith has been sniffing around, and Lisa's email is compromised.Time is running out, and with no ghosts to cross-examine, Vic can't afford to turn down any offers of help. An old enemy can provide an innovative way to track Vic's missing friend, and he enters into an uneasy alliance—even though its ultimate cost will ensnare him in a debt he may never manage to settle.THE PSYCOP SERIES1 Among the Living, novella (in paperback Partners)2 Criss Cross, novella (in paperback Partners)3 Body & Soul, novella (in paperback Property)4 Secrets, novel (in paperback Property)5 Camp Hell, novel6 GhosTV, novelPSYCOP SHORTSMany Happy ReturnsStriking SparksStroke of MidnightMind ReaderThaw",
