  "description": "Despite her ex-husband's bullheadedness, Carol Kyle knew he'd be the perfect man to father the child she so desperately wanted. Yet she also realized that the strong, honorable man would never allow his child to be raised without a father. So Carol needed to plot, to plan, to maneuver, to seduce Steve into her bed for one last time . . . and then leave once more. Still, the passion when they were together was never the problem -- it was the absences that tore them apart. Had they grown enough to chance trying again -- especially when Carol's plan seemed about to work?",
