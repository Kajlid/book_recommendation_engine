  "title": "Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind",
  "description": "In this compelling book, Hans Moravec predicts that machines will attain human levels of intelligence by the year 2040, and that by 2050, they will surpass us. But even though Moravec predicts the end of the domination by human beings, his is not a bleak vision. Far from railing against a future in which machines rule the world, Moravec embraces it, taking the startling view that intelligent robots will actually be our evolutionary heirs. \"Intelligent machines, which will grow from us, learn our skills, and share our goals and values, can be viewed as children of our minds.\" And since they are our children, we will want them to outdistance us. In fact, in a bid for immortality, many of our descendants will choose to transform into \"ex humans,\" as they upload themselves into advanced computers.This provocative new book, the highly anticipated follow-up to his bestselling volume Mind Children , charts the trajectory of robotics in breathtaking detail. A must read for artificial intelligence, technology, and computer enthusiasts, Moravec's freewheeling but informed speculations present a future far different than we ever dared imagine.",
