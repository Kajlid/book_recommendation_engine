  "description": "Thailand is known as the ‘Land of Smiles’, but beyond the smiles there is a darker side to the kingdom. These seven true stories show that drugs, deceit, scams and sordid ping pong shows have become an undeniable and accepted part of the most popular tourist destinations in Thailand, namely Pattaya, Bangkok and Phuket. Caught on Camera and Pattaya Youtuber are two gripping modern stories that show the old saying ‘what happens in Thialand, stays in Thailand’ no longer holds true. Visitors to Thailand beware!",
