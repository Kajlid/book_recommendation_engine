  "title": "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box - a Sherlock Holmes Short Story",
  "description": "It's all about a cardboard box. Or rather, what was in the cardboard box mailed anonymously from Belfast to Miss Susan Cushing, a fifty-year-old \"maiden lady\" of Cross Street, Croydon. It was filled, almost to the brim, with course salt. The rest of the box was taken up by two, recently-severed, human ears from, obvious after a quick glance, two different people.Inspector Lestrade attended and soon wrote Sherlock Holmes that, \"I think this case is very much in your line.\" Holme's response? \"Ring for our boots [Watson] and tell them to order a cab.\"Librarian's note: [from Kessinger Publishing] this scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the original.
