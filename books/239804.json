  "description": "I’M ABOUT TO CROSS A LINE THAT WILL DESTROY ME, MY BEST FRIEND, AND THE WOMAN WE BOTH LOVE…  My best friend, Derrick, and I have always shared women. And we were damn good at it, too. So good, we had a laundry list of women at our disposal. Nothing could stop us. And then Eve Montgomery came crashing into our world.  One look and I knew I had to have her. There was only one problem—Derrick saw her first, and he claimed her before I could. And for the first time ever, he wasn’t sharing. Until now.  I just never imagined it would happen after they were married. I’ve waited years for a taste of Eve, but she’s my best friend’s wife. It’s a line I know I shouldn’t cross. But I do. And now there’s no going back.",
