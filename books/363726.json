  "description": "Step into the world that exists inside all our heads. There are no secrets, no taboos, just humans being human. This book opens the door to our innermost sanctum so we can all gawk at the odd, horrific, fantastic side of human's less spoken of nature. In this collection of short stories, you'll both laugh and cringe, maybe be left feeling violated or finally understood. Dive into the minds of humanity and view a world through gray-tinted glasses. If women ruled the world there would be no war, but we would all have been aborted.",
