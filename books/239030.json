  "description": "Kyler Mercy is free. After several years of being Jack's favorite plaything, he's free to do as he pleases. If only he knew what pleased him. Of course, Remi isn't one of those things. Or so he thinks. And to make matters worse, a ghost from the past is hot on Kyler's heels, intent on keeping him under lock and key, whether Remi or Kyler like it.",
