  "description": "Trapped in a library during a blizzard, Elise finds herself stuck with the untoward magnate, Lucent Storme, who's rumored to have more than a few forbidden desires...(A Cerys du Lys contemporary BDSM erotic romance novelette)When Elise Tanner finds herself trapped with Lucent Storme in a library during a record-breaking blizzard, she panics. How did -he- get here? He doesn't know her, but she knows him. Lucent is the newly appointed Director of Public Relations for Landseer Enterprises and an influential business magnate; who wouldn't know him?Elise knows him and she hates him. He seems false, fake, too self-important by far, and excessively demanding. Worse yet, with over six feet of snow expected and the streets completely unmanageable, there's no way for her to escape him.She's heard rumors of Lucent's darker sexuality, too. He's predatory and dominant supposedly--definitely dominant, Elise finds out--but he seems like so much more, too. Lucent proves himself both intelligent and charming(though reserved and terse), much to Elise's surprise. Is there really more to this handsome, rakish, enigmatic man, or is it all a facade for His darker, more Absolute, Obsession.(This scintillating contemporary BDSM erotic romance novelette of domination and submission is ~17,200 words in length)",
