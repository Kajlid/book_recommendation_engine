  "description": "Adopted at birth, fifteen year old Felicia Murphy has no idea she's the offspring of a Fury and a god of Mercy. The discovery will soon shatter her world... Felicia's reputation as stable and trustworthy means everything if she's to win the grant for the troubled kids she mentors. Snakes emerging from her head, massive mood swings, and a strong thirst for vengeance do not fit into her plans. She has no time to worry about her adoptive parent's separation and the unwanted discovery that her biological parents are supernatural freaks. She can't confide in her friends; who would believe her? As her life spins out of control, she allows herself to be distracted by the two new guys who are suddenly showering her with attention, pulling her in different directions. Felicia has choices to make. Embrace the Fury and risk everything, or find a way to tame the beast.",
