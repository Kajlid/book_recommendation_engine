I can play any role handed to me.Hell, I love a new challenge.Only Archer Bremen is different… and not just for the obvious reasons.His British accent hits me in a way I never expected.The scowl on his face makes me think of a million things I could do to make it fade.His smile tells me that this new assignment is going to change everything…",
