  "title": "I Like Food, Food Tastes Good: In the Kitchen with Your Favorite Bands",
  "description": "What happens when indie bands hit the road They get hungry! Food writer Kara Zuaro knows a lot of musicians, and she's found they all share one obsession (besides music, of course): eating. Whether theyre on the tour bus reminiscing about meals past or at home in their own kitchens, theyve all got favorite recipes -- and theyre willing to share. This uniquely irresistible cookbook collects contributions from more than 100 artists, including indie icons like the Violent Femmes, Belle & Sebastian, and They Might Be Giants; current favorites like Franz Ferdinand and My Morning Jacket; and up-and-coming acts like Catfish Haven and Voxtrot. Some recipes are inspired by a particular song in the band's repertoire, others are taken from real-life experience. Each one bears the often quirky stamp of its source -- while these are thoroughly tested, cook-from-me recipes, Zuaro has left the musicians wording and instructions intact, which makes for a collection that's as much fun to read as it is to use. For example, from Devendra Banhart's RIGHT ON!!!!!!here is my favorite recipe AFRICANAS RICAS!you shall require!many bananas!a box of graham crackers!!!two eggs!!!SOUR CREAM!!HONEY! You get the idea. Part indie music discovery guide, part foodie fantasy, and all fun, I Like Food, Food Tastes Good is a cookbook for anyone whose iPod is always on.",
