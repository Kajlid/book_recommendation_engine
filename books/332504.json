  "description": "I thought talking to a sexy stranger online would be harmless—until I find out he goes to my high school. Now, he and his crew won’t stop blackmailing me. Between studying for exams, obeying strict curfews, and dealing with overprotective parents who expect me to reign at the top of Redwood Academy’s senior class, I just want to have some fun. But getting messed up with the Poison boys isn’t what I expect to happen when I log in to an online chat room. Corrupt. Cruel. Callous. Poison is everything wrong with Redwood Academy. They have no problem with burning Redwood Academy to ashes, exposing the wealthy for the snakes they truly are, and blackmailing an innocent girl they met online. If anyone finds out what I have done, my good-girl reputation will be tarnished. Will I be able to keep these bad boys at bay? Or will they suck me into their bloodstained, havoc-filled world? Poison is a new-adult reverse harem romance and the second book in the Bad Boys of Redwood Academy series of stand-alones. This series does not have to be read in order. Fans of Havoc at Prescott High by C.M. Stunich and The Lies We Tell by Becca Steele will fall in love with this steamy reverse-harem contemporary romance! One-click to preorder today",
