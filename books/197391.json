  "description": "Descended from a legendary Celtic tribe that guards the secrets of the ancient stone circles, the Quinn women have a great responsibility to protect their pagan rituals and way of life. As members of the formidable Circle of Nine, they celebrate the holidays of the year from Yule to Samhain, keeping the traditions alive through the centuries against insurmountable odds. We first met these women in Circle of Nine â€“ Beltany, and now a set of three novellas reveals more of their engaging stories. In Bressa's Banishment, the power struggle between Father Banan and village healer Bressa Gormley unfolds amidst accusations of murder, treachery, and witchcraft. Can the Circle of Nine protect their trusted healer and the path of the Tuatha against a growing religious fervor?",
