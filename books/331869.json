  "description": "One night of carefree fun was all she wanted.That isn’t what she got.She never meant for things to go this far . . .All Serena wanted was one night of drinking, dancing, and flirting: fun without commitment and a way to forget her troubles. But when Serena wakes up the next morning in an unfamiliar house owned by two handsome strangers, things take an unexpected turn.With only vague, fragmented memories of the night before, she fears the worst. Against her better judgment, she can’t leave this house without speaking to these men and knowing what happened.The men, however, are not what she expected. Damien is sarcastic, kind, flirty, and built like a Greek God, while Alex is arrogant, intimidating, and mercurial. Yet, the two of them are inseparable. After spending years keeping everyone at a distance, Serena slowly becomes entwined in the lives (and beds) of these two very different men, knowing that it won’t last forever.It can’t last forever.",
