He also shines his unique light on subjects as diverse as science and meditation personality and essence homosexuality witnessing and silence.He left the world in utter silence in joy in peace. He left the world like a lotus flower it was worth celebrating and these are the occasions for you to learn how to live and how to die. Each death should be a celebration but it can be a celebration only if it leads you to higher planes of existence.My effort here is to help you all to live like buddhas and die like buddhas the death of a Buddha is both is not a death because life is eternal life does not being with birth and does not end with death. Millions of times you have been born and died they are all small episodes in the eternal pilgrimage but because you are unconscious you cannot see that which is beyond birth and death.Osho is in a category all of his own and as he states. I am nobody I dont belong to any nation I dont belong to any political party. I am simply an individual the way existence created me. I have kept myself absolutely uninfluenced by any idiotic ideology religious political social financial and the miracle is that because I am not burdened with all these glasses on my eyes and curtains before me I can see clearly.About the AuthorOsho defies categorization, reflecting everything from the individual quest for meaning to the most urgent social and political issues facing society today. His books are not written but are transcribed from recordings of extemporaneous talks given over a period of thirty-five years. Osho has been described by The Sunday Times In Londo",
