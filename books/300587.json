Four broken hearts... Anyone got any tape? I may be self-destructive and have sucked them into my mess, destroying everyone’s lives in the process, but I’m sure I can fix it. It’s gonna take focus and determination, both of which I’m sorely lacking. I’m a spoiled boy who’s used to getting what I want. In this case, I want them. All of them. And I sure as hell won’t stop until I succeed. Not until we’re bound together by… Me.

This story contains MF/MFMM/MM scenes. It’s the epic conclusion in the Torn and Bound duet. Torn Apart must be read first.",
