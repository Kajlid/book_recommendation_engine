  "description": "Betrayal runs in the family…  The Hunted Witch Agency is hot on the heels of the leader of the witch slave trade. I’m determined to bring them down, even though they’re closer to home than I realise. Gerard, the only male keeping me sane, is ready to put them down for good. Until I’m kidnapped.  The witch who takes me has a personal vendetta. She can torture me all she likes, but she’ll never make me give up my mission to end her enterprise. And her.  I’m witch royalty, I’m a warlock disgrace. And now, I’m kidnapped. However, my magic is under control. For now. How long can I keep avoiding the inevitable?",
