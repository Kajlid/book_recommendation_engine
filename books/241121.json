Their parents were kind, loving people who treasured their children, but went to their graves because of a secret they refused to share with their young daughters.  Now the girls are grown up and on their own. Poppy’s bubbly personality is perfect for her job as a real estate agent. She enjoys nature and photography, and spending time with her friends at the clubs or at home. Scarlette is an ER nurse with the perfect job. She is dating a hunky doctor, living with her sister and best friend, and wanting for nothing. Slight changes in her perception occur that make Scarlette question what is happening with her.  Lyndy’s career as a successful editor allows her to purchase an old silo and renovate it into living space for three on the go women. When an old flame, Luca, comes back to town, sparks literally fly. Tempers flare, causing physical and emotional changes in Lyndy that leave her wondering what is happening.  The women are thrust into danger and transformation when they find out the secret their parents had been keeping from them.
