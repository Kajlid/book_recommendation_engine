  "description": "A globalizing Rome has taken nations and tribes by force, and the loss of national and tribal identity leaves people adrift in an indifferent empire. A widow sends her former slave to fetch her granddaughter, while a silver merchant routes his son around the Mediterranean—where Jews and Christians are pulling apart from each other. Jews find themselves without their centralizing Temple, Christians without their Son of God. Fatalists tun to the stars, Stoics and Epicureans only to themselves. The two young people cross paths, bringing down the worlds of their parents and testing the wisdom of the man whom Rome calls Son of God—the emperor, Trajan.",
