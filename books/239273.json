Of course, since she’s Aunt Tillie, her dose of retribution comes in the form of her favorite holiday Christmas stories. For Bay and Landon, that means they’re shoved into A Witchmas Carol, one of Aunt Tillie’s favorite tales. That should mean hugs and happiness, right?

To escape, they have to figure out exactly what Aunt Tillie wants… and she’s got a few tricks up her sleeve.So, it’s that time of the year. Things are about to get merry… and maybe a little messy… for the Winchesters.
