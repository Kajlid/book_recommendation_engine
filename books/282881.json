  "title": "How To Raise The Dead",
  "description": "A dark mystery, a wildly inaccurate reputation, and a snarky black pug familiar. Kati’s first term at Second Breath Academy is off to one hell of a start.  All Kati Wilson wants is to keep her head down, ignore the rumours about her brother, and avoid anything that qualifies as danger, drama, or evil deeds. But the academy has other plans. Completely against her will, Kati finds herself lumbered with two perky, over-enthusiastic friends, the centre of attention in every class, and fending off dark dreams that suggest not everyone will survive the term. Not to mention there’s a prophecy that says Kati will vanquish a great evil.  At least there’s the sweet, handsome guy who sees Kati as more than the sister of a maybe-evil-mastermind. The bad news is he’s utterly, irrefutably Off Limits. Because he’s her death magic teacher. And that comes scarily close to drama.  But at least Kati will get through the rest of her time at Second Breath Academy without encountering danger or evil deeds. Right…?  How To Raise The Dead takes place in a university-age academy for necromancers and reapers, but there’s plenty of magic, mystery, and romance to keep your interest if you’re totally over the academy genre. SBA is slow burn RH and builds with each book. This is a full-length novel at 71,000 words. All characters are adults.",
