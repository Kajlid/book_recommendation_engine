  "description": "Deputy Sergeant Wolf's ex-wife is in back in the picture, jealousy of his upcoming promotion to sheriff is escalating to violence, and a boy has just been reported missing--a lot of action for a ski resort town in the middle of the Colorado Rockies. All that trouble falls to background noise, however, when Wolf learns his brother has just committed suicide in northern Italy. Devastation and resentment of his sibling's selfish act is short-lived, because Wolf knows one thing is for certain: his brother would never kill himself. Or would he? A nagging suspicion there's more to the story is enough to pull Wolf from his volatile life, to Lecco, Italy--a picturesque city along the shores of Lake Como, where danger lies amid the ancient cobblestone alleys.With the aid of a beautiful Carabinieri agent, can Wolf piece together what really happened to his brother without suffering the same fate?",
