  "description": "Along with Aleister Crowley, Madame Blavatsky and George Gurdjieff, P. D. Ouspensky (1878-1947) was one of the most important and influential figures in the occult movement of the twentieth century.His book on the Tarot has remained practically unknown since its initial publication in Russia in 1913. Yet, it is an important work presenting a general introduction and Ouspenskyâ€™s insights on the 22 cards of the Greater Arcana. The cards are presented in pairs, each completing the sense of another. 22 cards from the Waite set, described by Ouspensky, have been produced in full color on the covers.Unabridged, corrected republication of the original (1913) edition.",
