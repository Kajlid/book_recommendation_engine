  "description": "I Ching Prescriptions are a different way of consulting the I Ching. The traditional method for using the counsel of I Ching is by throwing three coins six times or by dividing and counting yarrow stalks to arrive at a hexagram for an answer to a question. This method of allowing chance to provide an appropriate response to what is on your mind at the time relies on a phenomenon that Carl Jung called synchronicity. Many people wonder how could anyone take seriously an answer to a question arrived at by tossing coins and decide that the I Ching is not for them. It doesn’t matter whether you believe in synchronicity or not. It doesn’t matter if you want to take the time to figure out the obscurity or understand the poetic symbolic language of the I Ching. When people dismiss the I Ching because of the method of relying on random chance they miss out on the philosophy that is imbedded within the I Ching that originated over five thousands years of Chinese culture. A philosophy that has survived for thousands of years has a message worth pondering. Since the philosophy of I Ching is based on nature and has lasted so many thousands of years and transferred over many cultures, why not benefit from its wisdom whether you believe in synchronicity or not? Find an I Ching Prescription for your need of the moment.",
