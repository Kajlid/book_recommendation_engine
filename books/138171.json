  "description": "Bdsmbookreviews called this \"like sitting around a table with a group of kinky people and having frank conversation, telling stories, and giving advice.\"This ebook is the compilation of interviews over a 4-year period with hundreds of tops and bottoms about bondage and erotic submission. The resulting snippets (comments, observations, recollections, and “war stories”) capture the thrill, wonder, eroticism, emotions, paradoxes, and ambivalence associated with BDSM.There are many thought-provoking ideas here, some very funny stories, and a bit of insight into what makes males and females so delightfully (and sometimes exasperatingly) different.The author, a submissive female who is a self-described bondage freak, takes the position that bondage can be viewed as a rewarding and erotic end in itself, not just a means to accomplish something else, e.g., a whipping.Whether you’re dominant, submissive, or a curious open-minded vanilla, there is much in this (female friendly) book that you will find entertaining and sexy.Definitely for (non-uptight) adults only!Xavier’s Book Reviews also loved the “At times the things mentioned were funny and others eyebrow raising, but one thing was for certain. I enjoyed and learned from what I read equally! Well done.”",
