  "title": "Haunted Homeplace: Tales from the Borderlands of Tennessee and Kentucky",
  "description": "You'll find tales of things that live in shadows and only come when they're called. The trouble is that you don't always know when you've called them.  * The haunted library, where one can distinctly hear the sound of soft bare feet on the wooden floor and the slow scrape of a book being removed from the bookcase. * A departed old hog named Bramble Brew, fierce in life, more fierce in death.  * The spirit of a dead man, rich while alive, who's come back to claim his prized possession. * An old root cellar that Granny swears is nothing to be afraid of; she says the smell is from the earth walls, and that's it's just the moist air trapped in a small space. But dead things are in the dark. Read about these spirits and more in Haunted Homeplace.",
