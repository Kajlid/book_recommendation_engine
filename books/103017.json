  "description": "Two brothers, two countries, two sides of a war.Finding their way as young men lead one brother to the Finnish army and the other to school in Leningrad, neither of which is a safe place to be on the brink of World War II. Patriotic responsibility and communist zeal can’t shield the brothers from the realities of adulthood.As one gets entangled in espionage for the Soviet Union and the other fights for the hopelessly outnumbered Finnish army, winter sets in. The Winter War brings the two brothers together at a stalled convoy in the frozen north and only their love—for each other, for a woman, for Finland—can save them.",
