  "description": "Like everyone else in his generation, seventeen-year-old Calvary Dominique is waging war against time… and losing miserably. In a world dominated by technology, political turmoil, and broken economy, holding your head above water is almost impossible. However, “Broken Daydreams… Otherwise Known as My Eclectic, Sometimes Random, Almost Optimistic, Totally Unconventional Thoughts on How to Redeem a Fractured Generation” reminds us that despite the all-consuming darkness, hope is always dancing in the shadows.Calvary has been surrounded by faith since he was a little boy. His stories of attending church, youth group, and Christian camps are not what one would expect from a member of Generation Z. And nobody realizes that more than Calvary. The tale of his spiritual journey through childhood, adolescence, and teen years is exciting, unique, and yet relatable. Those young and old who, just like Calvary, are bored with this trend-driven, high-obsessed era, would find a kindred spirit in the narrator of “Broken Daydreams.”The rich and resonating narrative, coupled with the beauty of Calvary’s own poems, are what makes “Broken Daydreams” the perfect book for those struggling to find their way in this strange contemporary society.",
