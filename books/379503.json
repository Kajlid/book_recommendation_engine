  "description": "Life has not been easy for Gracelin O'Malley. Only fifteen when she married the local English landlord to save her family from financial ruin, she has tried to be a dutiful wife, providing him with an heir. Despite her husband's escalating cruelty, Gracelin's spirit remains unbroken, though she is no longer the innocent country girl she once was. As famine devastates the land, she openly defies him by feeding the desperate souls who come to the door. As political unrest sweeps across the countryside, she harbors Irish rebels -- her own brilliant brother among them -- keeping hidden, as well, the deepest secret of her heart. And as disaster threatens those she loves most, Gracelin fights to keep them alive, her profound courage inspiring everyone around her.",
