What are the nano-powders produced in the labs actually being used for? And how far are his superiors willing to go to test the success of their inventions? Desperate to find answers that will also help him justify the ethics of his life's work, Gopal stumbles upon some incriminating documents and is soon sucked into a terrifying labyrinth of deceit and corruption. Now Gopal Chandran is on the run . . . but there's nowhere left to run to.",
