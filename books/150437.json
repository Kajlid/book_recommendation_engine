Poor, starved, and armed with only their lowly powers, an unlikely crew of slum-born form a secret rebel group with the sole purpose of assassinating the Banshee King, who rules from the Lifted City above where those born rich—and with great powers—live in luxury. When all seems hopeless, the rebellion discovers that their newest member—a boy who CAN sleep and dream—just might be the key to their victory.*THIS IS BOOK #1 IN THE OUTLIER SERIES**It is recommended to read this series in order**Some portions of the book end in cliffhangers*OUTLIER: REBELLION (#1)OUTLIER: LEGACY (#2)OUTLIER: REIGN OF MADNESS (#3)OUTLIER: BEYOND OBLIVION (#4)OUTLIER: WEAPONS OF ATLAS (#5)OUTLIER: GIFTS OF THE GODDESS (#6)",
