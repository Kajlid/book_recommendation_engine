An outbreak occurred during the summer of 1832. One day during this visit, the man is reading a book near the window overlooking a scenic view of the Hudson River. His attention is focused upon the cholera epidemic nevertheless. When he glances up from the pages of his novel, the man sees a ghastly sight on a distant hill at the edge of the far side of the river--there is an enormous creature larger than any oceangoing ship climbing down the embankment!Librarian's note: this entry is for the story, \"The Sphinx.\" Collections of short stories by the author can be found elsewhere on Goodreads.",
