  "description": "Praise for previous \"This variorum edition will be the basis of all future Donne scholarship.\" —ChroniqueThis is the 4th volume of The Variorum Edition of the Poetry of John Donne to appear. This volume presents a newly edited critical text of the Holy Sonnets and a comprehensive digest of the critical-scholarly commentary on them from Donne's time through 1995. The editors identify and print both an earlier and a revised authorial sequence of sonnets, as well as presenting the scribal collection—which contains unique authorial versions of several of the sonnets—inscribed by Donne's friend Rowland Woodward in the Westmoreland manuscript.",
