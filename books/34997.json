  "title": "The Summoning",
  "description": "The earth has long been the battleground between the forces of Light and Dark. There have been wars that have torn the world apart many times. The Custodes Noctis were created to help fight in those wars, and through the millennia have faced many Dark foes and driven them through the Veil into the Between World. But the world is changing, things are stirring that haven't seen the light of the sun for epochs. The oldest family of Custodes Noctis, the Emrys, have fought on the side of the Light for thousands of years. Now, Rob Emrys is being called by something sinister and unseen, a command he must obey. While his brother, Galen, desperately attempts to save his brother, Rob finds himself unwillingly summoned to what could very possibly be his deathâ€”or worse.",
