It's thought that she brought evil voodoo to the world, but that's wrong. Bali, an unsure 18-year-old, African-American girl is a recent high school graduate, and is about to find out how her connection of lineage to Tituba gives her great powers of good magic. Bali, along with her two new friends, Leilani and James, set out to figure out how to navigate these new magical gifts they've been given. During their time together, they must also learn how to navigate their own insecurities and personal problems, while saving New York City from an evil witch named Adelram. This story weaves the true tale of magic, and how #blackgirlmagic is that of goodness and love. Come step inside a fantastic story with Bali, James and Leilani and learn how powerful diversity can be.",
