  "description": "I never used to live my life by rules.At least not until my fianc√© betrayed me, turning my entire world upside down.Unsure of how to move on, my luck seemed to suddenly change. My estranged mother's last gift to me before she died landed on my doorstep, giving me the opportunity to start my life over.I snatched up the chance to leave my life behind in Minnesota, opening my arms up to the hot, sunny weather of Texas.It was easy to start over in unfamiliar territory, my unofficial rules of heartbreak worn on my chest like a badge of honor.But along with the house my mother left came a new neighbor. An obnoxious neighbor with dangerous glaring eyes and a set of abs that should be considered illegal. He was mysterious and full of secrets, a story hidden behind his hard exterior.Before I knew it, Dallas Beckett was about to break all my rules.I just didn't realize he had his own set, and I was about to put every one of them to the test.",
