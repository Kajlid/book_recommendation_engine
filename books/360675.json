  "title": "A Lot of Croc : An Urban Bush Legend",
  "description": "Every middle-class girl who comes to the Northern Territory wants to find a lover to lick the unfamiliar red dust and scour the city from her body. A chance to jump out of her skin and harden her soft urban core . . .Connie is a barmaid working in a dead-end job; her life is going nowhere fast. One night, Rod Ansell appears on television, riding to fame as the real man behind the legend of Crocodile Dundee. Something in his wild eyes and tangled, sun-bleached hair makes Connie sit up straight and suck in her breath. She pulls her last beer and makes plans to track the legend.With nothing more than a beat-up old car and a hunger for stories, Connie hooks up with anyone who can embroider her fantasies about Rod - her ‘could’ve been lover’.From right-wing pastoralists with their love of the land to leftie lawyers and dreamers with swags, Connie drinks with them all and embarks on a journey as wild and wayward as the Territory itself. At the core of her quest is a curiosity about survival. What does it mean to live on the very edge?Dark, provocative and sexy, A Lot of Croc is a thrilling ride deep into the heart of the Badlands. It’s not so much bush out there as it is urban grunge played out against a backdrop of red dust and big, empty sky.",
