  "description": "Developers are planning to destroy Brentford's beloved football grounds. Something must be done, and the lads of The Flying Swan, Brentford’s celebrated drinking house, take up the challenge. Norman has recently discovered a Victorian computer that holds the secrets of the super-technology of a bygone age, and Archroy, Brentford’s lone explorer, has just returned from his seventh voyage, bringing with him the fabled Golden Fleece. Surely, with these stalwarts working for the cause, the field is as good as saved. But this is Brentford, and the ancient forces of evil—Old Testament horrors, beasties from the bottomless pit, that sort of evil—are stirring.",
