Her plan is coming along splendidly until The Earl of Guildford walks—or rather, saunters—into town, and steals it from under her nose.Charlie can see only one way to save his sister from the horrible marriage his father has planned for her. He has to marry an heiress, Lady Eleanor, who has taken up residence in Bath. In order to secure the final place in the Royal Crescent, he has no choice but to offer any price it takes. He only has to stay for long enough to woo Lady Eleanor, but when a remarkably vexing young woman next door refuses to leave him in peace, he cannot help but declare war. A war of wits, a war of schemes, and most unexpectedly…a war against his obstinate heart. Miss Dixon is not only vexing, but she is intriguing and beautiful in a way he has never seen before. Whether she likes it or not, he’s keeping his place in Bath. But whether he can keep his heart is another matter entirely.***The Earl Next Door is a sweet regency romantic comedy.
