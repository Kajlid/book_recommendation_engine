  "title": "You Are Here",
  "description": "You Are Here' explores the lives of Gavin, Dave, Phil and Tony four thirty somethings who feel they might be over the hill and may never meet the women of their dreams. They are about to embark on yet another holiday religiously known as 'The Campaign'. They all have only one thing in girls, and lots of them. Slightly risque with plenty of humour and fun, encompassing many incidents with the opposite sex, which most males, and some females, no doubt, could relate to! Most definitely a funny and entertaining read with a nice little twist at the end.",
