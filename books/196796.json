  "description": "Lt. Col. Boone Ballestra's finally found the courageous woman of his combat weary dreams.(Too bad he's gotta dump her to save her from his sisters Mafia in-laws.)Hugs & home-baked cookies sound good to a Marine back from OPS, but Boone's got nothing but a note from his AWOL sister putting him on deck to fetch his 4 year old niece ...20 minutes ago. A lifetime of cleaning up family messes makes this no surprise, but lead-footing it into camp just in time to stop the child's Mafia Grampa from abducting her IS. The toxic in-law plans to stop Boone's sister from testifying against his murderous son by making a pawn of his innocent grandchild. Fortunately camp director Brianna Parrish confronts the mobster, or spunky Savannah would be lost to them forever....It's not exactly how Boone planned to impress the woman who helped him watch over his family while he served his country. Back home & in control, he has no intentions of relying on outsiders again, but his sister goes missing & Boone discovers knowing 100 ways to subdue an adversary is useless when it comes to your basic preschool princess wrangling. Brianna's gifted insights however, both console his traumatized niece,& decode parts of Boone he's kept camouflaged from the world (& himself.) She even teaches the man with a boatload of concerns to 'cast his cares' on God, which sounds just dandy...until Brianna foils the mob's plans one time too many & puts herself in their cross-hairs.Boone pushes away the love he's lacked all his life in order to keep Brianna safe. It's the perfect plan, (if only she were the kind of gal to abandon the people she loves). When she doesn't, Brianna's marked for death.Boone will trade his freedom for Brianna's in a heartbeat--- ----which it just might cost them.",
