  "description": "Eleven years is a long time to spend on the run... It may be a new city and a new name, but it's the same old story. Never let anyone get close. Never let on that you're more than what's on the surface. I've gotten pretty good at both of those things. After over a decade of practice, it was bound to happen. I'm working in a random vampire bar, O, keeping my head down and my profile low. Every day is the same. And \"same\" is safe. But that all changes when a ridiculously handsome wolf shifter walks in and the attraction I feel is fueled by an ancient magic. Little do I know, this is just the beginning. Sparks fly when The Fates themselves bring me and my mates together. Three incredible shifters are about to turn my life upside-down in the best of ways. But the question is, can I trust them with my secrets, or will sharing my truth lead to disaster? Fated is a reverse harem paranormal romance where the main character has multiple partners. Due to mature content, this series is recommended for those 18+. Trigger warning: contains references to abuse and sexual assault.",
