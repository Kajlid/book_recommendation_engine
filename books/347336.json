Just to make sure, he offers some last-minute help to his mom and, in typical Splat fashion, he messes up completely! That night Splat stays awake hoping to see Santa Claus. But when Splat misses him, he's sure his Christmas is ruinedâ€”along with his hopes for a really big present. . . .   Everyone's favorite furry cat is back in a Christmas story perfect for any child anxiously awaiting Santa's arrival.",
