  "title": "Elizabeth's Education",
  "description": "Elizabeth is a beautiful, intelligent, wealthy young woman, but spoiled and wilful, flirtatious and feisty. She is also totally mesmerised by the one man who shows her no interest - the dashing, mysterious, Lord Michael. But what the young virgin soon discovers is that Lord Michael is a strict disciplinarian, and when Elizabeth's father asks him to watch over the haughty young lady, Lord Michael takes the opportunity to begin her education. Forced to surrender to a sound over the knee spanking, a tearful, mortified, Elizabeth learns that her actions suddenly have consequences. Under his artful mastery, the passionate girl is led through deepening layers of submission, and with bondage and discipline constant companions on her journey, she quickly learns the torrid lessons of pleasure and pain, reward and punishment. Ultimately, her submissive nature finds her aching to serve him solely and completely. But if she wants to call him Master, she must agree to an intense initiation, proving her sincerity, displaying her hedonistic hunger, and earning the privilege. Only then will he collar the young supplicant and call her his own.",
