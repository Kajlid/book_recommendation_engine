  "description": "Blond-haired, blue-eyed Dorian Gray is a guileless young man, who arrives one day at the studio of painter Basil Hallward. There he meets the world-wise Lord Henry Wotton, whose hedonistic and cynical view of life is dramatically different from that of the more earnest Hallward. The two men spar in a witty war of words, and Dorian feels inexorably drawn to Wotton's philosophy of youthful pleasure and amorality. As Hallward completes his portrait, Dorian wishes that he could always remain youthful-and that the painting could bear the burdens of the advancing years. Wilde's tale takes the reader into a world in which such things are possible. We meet the unaging Dorian Gray at his leisure, taking advantage of his ability to charm all those around him, and taking his pleasures without heed of the consequences. But one day, after a rash act of cruelty to the woman who loves him, Dorian notices that something in his portrait has changed--a cruel smile has twisted its once-perfect lips. Adding touches of the gothic and the supernatural to his satiric depiction of upper-class British life, Wilde creates a classic modern myth: the handsome young aristocrat, who remains beautiful while his portrait, the mirror of his soul, withers.Also included in this volume are \"Lord Arthur Savile's Crime,\" \"The Canterville Ghost,\" \"The Sphinx Without a Secret,\" and \"The Model Millionaire,\" which together comprise the most important of Wilde's short fiction.",
