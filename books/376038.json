  "title": "Briefs and Pants",
  "description": "The book is a series of short stories in different styles, some parodying other writings, some rather rude. They are inventions, but everything related has surely happened to someone somewhere. Any reader may recognise himself in these pages, though he is not there. Between the stories are short verses relevant (mostly, but not the one about a dog) to the neighbouring narratives. Some are funny, but life is generally awesome and sad. There is one S/M tale, to be dodged by the timid. All is for fun purposes only.",
