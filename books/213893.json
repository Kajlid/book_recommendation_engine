Instead of obsessing over things she can’t control, Andy takes on a unique case involving a troubled troop of cadets from the RC MP training academy. The troop is tightly bonded, especially since the recent death of a fellow cadet. They are also hiding a secret, and Andy has been tasked with uncovering it. When Kate unexpectedly shows up as part of the team supporting the troop, Andy has to find a way to balance her job and her heart. As the conspiracy is exposed, a medical emergency brings Kate and Andy closer together even as the troop begins to fall apart.Follow-up to Trigger and Pathogen.",
