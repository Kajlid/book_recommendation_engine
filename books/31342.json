It might be a spot on the ceiling, or an oddly-shaped tortilla chip, or a bit of wood grain. But why settle for staring at the coffee table? What if there was a book on that table specially created to amaze and delight pot smokers and their friends? This highly entertaining collection of images is the ultimate centerpiece and conversation starter. Featuring dozens of immersive, trippy, funny, meditative, and mind-bending images, each page offers a new visual world of wonder that everyone can enjoy especially those living the high life",
