  "description": "Catholic New York City celebrates the religious and cultural life f one of the largest Catholic populations in the world. The first Catholic church was founded in the 1780s, and the diocese was subsequently founded in 1808, when there were only a few priests in the entire state. The 1879 completion of the country's best-known Catholic church, St. Patrick's Cathedral, was a crowning moment in New York City's Catholic history. Between 1850 and 1900, the Catholic population of New York City grew from 200,000 to more than 1.2 million due to a tremendous influx of Irish, German, Italian, Polish, and other European immigrants. Throughout the last 200 years, the city has been home to a wide range of fascinating Catholic personalities, places, and events.",
