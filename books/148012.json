  "description": "The Fourth of July. Parades, fireworks, apple pie--and an amazing history of American freedom and revolution. Kat McGee doesn't know what she'd do without her favorite summery celebration of all things patriotic... but if she doesn't travel back in time to work her holiday-saving magic, she's going to find out--and fast. It's 1776. Thomas Jefferson has been kidnapped. The Declaration of Independence is gone. And the country's brilliant past rests on a young woman from the future, aided only by (the Statue of) Liberty, a young John Quincy Adams, and a whole lot of summer holiday spirit.",
