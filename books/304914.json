  "description": "KronidI’m not a good man. There’s no point in denying it. You see what you get and what you get is a bastard who doesn’t give a fuck about what’s going on around him, unless it’s beneficial to me of course.I work for Katya, the owner of an elite tattoo parlor called Pins & Needles. There are five locations across the world: Moscow, London, Miami, Los Angeles, and Sydney. The front of Katya’s business is the parlor, but what she’s actually done is set up an underground shop for the arms dealing business she inherited from her dead husband, in addition to other nefarious activities. No one has a clue about what’s really done here, not even the damn feds and for the first time in the seven years I’ve been working for her we fuck up. One of the tattoo artists, Dema, sees something she shouldn’t. As Katya’s right hand man I can’t let this get out. I know what I have to do, and it’ll either be me throwing her body in the woods, or locking her up and selling her to the highest bidder, ensuring she’ll never see the light of day again. Funny how neither of those happen and I end up putting my own neck on the line for her. I’ve never cared about anyone in my entire fucking life, yet here I am, craving something more than blood and agony.",
