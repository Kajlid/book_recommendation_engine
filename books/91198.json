  "description": "It was supposed to be the best summer of Maggie’s life. Now it's the one she'd do anything to forget. Maggie Reynolds remembers hanging out at the gorge with her closest friends after a party the night before. She remembers climbing the path hand in hand with her perfect boyfriend, Joey. She remembers that last kiss, soft, lingering, safe. So why can’t she remember what happened next? All it takes is one second for everything to change. One moment to realize that it’s the people you love who hurt you the most. Compelling, heartbreaking and unforgettable; this is the American Dream ripped apart.",
