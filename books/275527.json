  "title": "Insolent",
  "description": "Love had cut me in so many ways I wondered if my heart could take any more. But then I saw him. He was my boss. A single father. And to top it off he was insolent. I didn’t intend to want him, that wasn’t my objective. But somehow I couldn’t say no. We shouldn’t have worked, but like witchcraft, I was under his spell.  My heart’s been destroyed before, I’m not sure it can handle heartbreak again.",
