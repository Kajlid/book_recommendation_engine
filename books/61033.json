  "description": "Yolanda Polanski has arrived in Two Rivers, Wisconsin with a to save the little town from itself. The only problem is, none of her new friends know why Two Rivers needs to be saved-- despite finding themselves increasingly implicated in her mysterious schemes. It's not long before Yolanda's friends become concerned that her plan might not be as wholesome as they originally thought, and even the safety of the townspeople is brought into question. Is Yolanda insane? A visionary? A terrorist? All three? Sometimes, it's a thin line between brilliance and lunacy, and the good people of Two Rivers are about to find out just how thin that line can be. \"Sydney's rendition of a female mid-life crisis is equally hilarious and poignant. Yolanda might just be my favorite fictitious friend.\" -- Anne Michaud, author and nominee, Bram Stoker Prize for Best Anthology, 2011",
