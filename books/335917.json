  "description": "*Platinum Bestseller*Over the past 150 years New Zealanders have developed their own take on the English language. And it's not just about fush and chups. Rather it's about the often hilarious and sometime downright baffling New Zealandisms we use in all sorts of situations, and for all types of pastimes and passions. In KIWI SPEAK, the top-selling author of CRICKET SPEAK and RUGBY SPEAK eavesdrops at the dinner table, the school yard, the farm and the sports club to bring us an entertaining dictionary of phrases and expressions. Drawn from a wide range of popular Kiwi culture, these are sayings we used to say and sayings we shouldn't say - but all toast the way New Zealanders yarn.Some examples of classic Kiwi speak:‘Ka pai!’ : Maori for ‘good’. Even your average Palagi or Honky feels confident enough using the above. Indeed some, the daring and reckless Pakeha, even attempt to place it in a full sentence: ‘Ka pai kai (food) in my puku (belly).’‘Haven’t seen you in yonks!’ : A cracker of a word, yonks. Literally meaning ‘ages’, one theory is that it comes from donkey’s years, another is that it’s taken from years, months and weeks.‘She’ll be right!’ : Arguably the most popular Kiwi phrase of all time. Can be used in response to a number of enquiries: ‘Shall we lock the car?’; ‘Do we have enough petrol to get us to Blenheim?’; ‘Are you wearing a condom?’",
