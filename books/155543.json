Founded in 1962, the International School of Lausanne, Switzerland celebrates an annual tradition of cultural exchange and good eating. This \"International Day\" compilation of wonderful family recipes from all over the world is a loving tribute to this spirit of sharing and global home cooking. Every recipe is authentic, every recipe is delicious, and many recipes are easy!\"What is patriotism but the love of the good things we ate in our childhood.\" - Lin Yutang. \"Strange to see how a good dinner and feasting reconciles everybody.\" - Samuel Pepys\"Switzerland's population is only about 75% Swiss, so it's quite fitting that this celebration of international cuisine was born here. Living in a foreign country doesn't mean giving up your roots; it just means learning to graft new traditions and ideas on to your existing ones. 'Global Home Cooking' is a mouth-watering taster of 41 nations' favourite dishes.\" -- Diccon Bewes, bestselling author of 'Slow Train to Switzerland' and 'Swiss Watching.'Book sales support the school's International Baccalaureate scholarship.",
