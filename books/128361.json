  "title": "More Joy in Heaven",
  "description": "More Joy in Heaven sprung out of Morley Callaghan's fascination with Red Ryan, a once-infamous bank robber. After his parole in 1935, Ryan was touted as an exemplary reformed criminal and enjoyed a brief spell of celebrity in Toronto. Ryan quickly lapsed and was killed within a year. Callaghan, troubled by the papers' glib treatment of the incident, decided to write a novel about it.  Red Ryan is not to be found in More Joy in Heaven--in his stead, Callaghan creates Kip Caley, a genuinely reformed bank robber. Caley is physically imposing but almost embarrassingly earnest and idealistic. On his release, he takes a job at a sportsman's hotel in his Ontario hometown, sitting in the bar and acting as an attraction, talking with anyone who wishes to meet with him. Local politicians treat him like a promising but overgrown child--a testament to the social system that their careers depend upon. As time wears on, however, Caley's novelty vanishes, and he is left with next to nothing beyond the woman he loves and a couple of unrepentant jailbird friends from his prison years.  This is a short novel, and Callaghan's technique prospers in this setting. His use of working-class idiom is forced and unconvincing--his characters sound like refugees from a mediocre 1930s talkie--but his attention to moral and political subtleties is impressive. More Joy in Heaven raises many questions about the uneasy relationship between crime, the media, and the state, questions that are just as relevant (and difficult to answer) now as they were in the days of Red Ryan. --Jack Illingworth",
