  "title": "The North Irish Horse in the Great War",
  "description": "Sent to France in August 1914 the North Irish Horse (NIH) were the first British reservist regiment to see action (at Le Cateau) before fighting as rearguard on the long retreat to the outskirts of Paris.For the next four years they saw action in many of the major battles (Ypres, Somme, Passchendaele, Cambrai) and were involved in the final advance to victory.The book not only describes the Regiments actions by squadron but focusses on the officers and men; their background, motivation and courageous deeds and sacrifices. The author places the Regiments achievement in the context of the overall war and also reflects on the effect that unfolding events (eg the Easter Rising) in Northern Ireland had on the Regiment and its members.The book draws on a wealth of primary source material, much unpublished including war diaries, personal accounts, letters and memoirs.Thus in addition to compiling the first history of the NIH, the author succeeds in painting a valuable picture of The Great War at the fighting end",
