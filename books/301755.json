  "description": "The Christian Clarity Putnam falls in love with a boy witch. For a Puritan girl in 17th Century Salem, first love can be wicked.The Witches once fought a bloodthirsty war with the Christians, and only a shoestring truce keeps them at bay. Practicing witchcraft is a crime in Salem. Witches have been hung, or worse.Clarity, turning 16, is expected to marry the older, domineering Jacob. Holding so desperately onto her adolescence, is it hard to understand why she would fall for the free-spirited Victor? Victor is a witch, ‘tis true, but he is not in the Devil’s Service. Not anymore, not since rejecting the Blood Witches to become by choice a Green Witch. But is knowing that enough for Clarity’s acceptance? Torn between two worlds—a world of enchantment and adventure, and a world of safety yet seclusion—Clarity is at a deceitfully candid crossroads in her life.",
