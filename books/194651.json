  "description": "It was five years since Elizabeth Alcester had laid eyes on her former stable boy, Ivan Tramore . . . five years since her world had collapsed in devastating ruin around her. Now, penniless and desperate, she finds herself at the mercy of a cruel, ruthless stranger—a man who vows to possess her, whose hot searing caresses fan the flames of her darkest desires. Tramore had returned home in triumph—the unwanted bastard was now Lord Ivan, eleventh Marquis of Powerscourt—the most powerful man in London. Yet one woman had sworn to defy him . . . the proud beauty whose touch had branded him forever. But when at last he holds Lissa trembling in his merciless embrace, his lust for vengeance suddenly explodes in a frenzied fever of passion, and now no power on heaven or earth can tear him from the innocent arms that hold him captive, or protect her from the rapturous moment when angels fall.",
