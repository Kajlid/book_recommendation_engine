  "description": "This novella is intended for Mature audiences only. There are scenes not suitable for readers under the age of 18.  Thread One, Adina Falling, is the first novella in the Threads of Fate Series.  Best-selling erotica author, Adina LaCroix lives a fairly charmed, normal life. Born a Vampire , Adina is forever 21. She is successful, beautiful and wealthy, the envy of women and the object of desire for men. Her days are occupied with more human pursuits such as writing and avoiding unwanted phone calls from her publisher and her mother. With nightfall, however, her Vampire nature takes over and her hunt for blood and sex consume her.  Wanting to keep her conscience clean, she refuses to kill her prey, usually men with dark secrets. Instead, she uses the gift of mind control to implant permanent fears into her victimâ€™s minds, ones so horrific that they will live in fear of death if they continue their evil ways. It was her way of doing the world a favor.  After her divorce from Michael Diamante, one of the most power-hungry and evil vampires in the world, Adina has remained single. Threats of permanent death from Michael have made her hesitant to find a mate. However, rumors have begun circulating around plans the Elders, the governing body of Vampires, have in store for her.  Plagued by a recurring nightmare, Adina begins a quest for answers. The only problem, instead of finding what she has been looking for; Adina is faced with more questions. Questions in the form of two men, Caleb Locke and Xander Stark.  One man holds promises of undying love and passion while the other holds the key to unlocking her secrets, and maybe even her heart.",
