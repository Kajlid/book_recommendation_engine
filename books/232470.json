  "title": "What Rough Beasts",
  "description": "Prepare to embark on a bizarre, and sometimes scary journey in which you will encounter. . .  • Amnesiac aliens with the ability to warp time. • A giant, armor-plated ankylosaurus struggling to get by in the modern world. • Deer who enthusiastically hunt humans. • A Tyrannosaurus Rex with an unusual calling.  Also, be sure to stop by the garage in which human brains are changed around like engine blocks. Have a drink at Death's favorite tavern. And, of course, watch out for the carnivorous monster that has been stalking a family for decades.  And that, dear reader, is a mere sampling of the beasts collected for your amusement.",
