  "title": "The Racial Elements of European History",
  "description": "This long-suppressed work by one of Germany’s foremost racial thinkers was first published in English in 1927. The author, an unabashed Nordicist, provides a remarkable oversight of the concept of race, defines five different European races and discusses their physical and mental characteristics.He then discusses non-European racial influences in Europe, the effect of environment, inheritance and racial mixture, before moving into an outline of the distribution of these races.The longest part of the book is taken up with a fascinating and referenced overview of European racial history, with a strong emphasis on the role played by the Nordic subgroup. Finally he looks at the future racial situation in Europe.Although this book displays the Nordicist sentiment so common at the time, it contains many eye-opening revelations and theories, including the claim that the original homeland of the Nordic race was North Western Europe, and that Sweden is the most Nordic country on earth, whereas Germany—the author’s home—was only 55% Nordic at time of writing.This is a fascinating historical document and provides a remarkable insight into pre-World War II German racial thought.Over 300 illustrations and maps highlight racial types and historical events",
