  "description": "I’ve moved past what happened on Del Rey, and I’ve kept the secret of what I did—what we did—buried deep. But I’m afraid I’ll never move past what happened six months later in Amsterdam.When Ellis Prior, an old friend of my dad’s, walked back into my life, we became fast friends, and he showed me things I can’t forget—things that brought me to my knees. But I walked away from that life, and I never looked back.It's been three years, but I can no longer ignore it.It awoke a hunger inside of me.A craving for something new.Something powerful.Now Hanna Thurber is on Del Rey looking for a place to escape, and I’m all too eager to provide. This ballerina is anything but delicate, and the chemistry between us is electric.But the past won’t stay dead, and Ellis Prior finds his way to the island too. Suddenly, there is something pulling the three of us together. What starts as innocent and fun turns into an attraction that is undeniably forbidden.There are no secrets on the island.There is only us.And the truth I can no longer ignore.",
