  "title": "The Girl with the Strange Green Eyes",
  "description": "[**this edition has color images**] A war veteran from the 25th century recounts his memories of a female soldier he served with during a brutal interstellar conflict. He looks back on the fighting they saw together, her relationship with their squad leader, and how the girl struggled with both her alcoholism and an alien blood virus she acquired along the way. His recollections are skewed, however, by his desire to cast himself in a more positive light by overly criticizing the girl's own service. And so it falls on the four short stories linked in between his reminiscing to tell the true tale of the girl with the strange green eyes.",
