  "description": "“So this is a city where you can live inside your favourite book, movie, tv show, or videogame, where you can be anyone you could possibly ever want to be, and you’re seriously telling me there’s no-one here who’s trying to be me, except for me? That’s ridiculous.”– Rowdy Roddy RandySeason One of the Rowdy Roddy Randy Show looks at the prequel years of Municipal City, when a handsome young man is thrust into the scene to irreparably shake things up forever. Watch with awe as an impressionable boy is forged into the smelted steel of manhood to become the unparalleled warrior-wizard-celebrity-genius that we already know him to be.Season Two reboots the double-life Randy was living while Lockhart stumbled about, obsessing about her cyborg boyfriend. Torn between his love for Anna, his indifference to Lockhart, and his testicle-shrinking detestation of Sam, Randy must decide whether he wants to be the best by playing by the rules, or be the best because he’s awesome.And finally Season Three continues on as sequel to where Cult Fiction left off, in a city scourged with the dangerous E-Virus, ready to explode, just waiting on the right spark to set it off. Will Randy be the jerk to set it off? Or will he rise to the challenge and claim that number one spot he so rightly deserves, in CULT FICTION: PLAYER TWO!",
