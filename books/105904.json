  "description": "What if your planet were being terraformed by an outside entity, with you on it, and there was nothing you could do?Days after a new star appears in the sky, the simple folk of the sleepy fishing community of Bay Banyon are attacked by huge creatures unlike any they've seen before. Those who survive the morning hole up in the ancient monastery that overlooks the town, only to have their safe-haven become their place of siege. Cut off from the outside world, they can only hope for rescue, but there might not be anybody left out there to help them. And their safe-haven may not be as safe as they thought.\"He could smell its breath like sulphur, a promise of pain and erasure. Hate rose up in his throat for it. For them. Whatever they were, it didn't matter. These were no incautious animals, passing through and poking about to satisfy hunger. Not even for blood, or pleasure, noteven for sport -- simply for murder, for removal -- only for eradication.\"",
