  "description": "After more than twenty years in homicide, it was surprising that Detective Peter Stone would be unprepared for what he was about to encounter. He had seen many, many tableaus of death and destruction before. He had seen plenty of carnage, blood and gore and the remnants of terror. There was none of that here. Here, the victims sat, looking almost peaceful, around the kitchen table, almost as if they had all fallen asleep at dinner, except there were no table settings, no food, no clues to what exactly had happened, each bound with duct tape to the chair where the final moments of life played out. Detective Peter Stone is about to face the most puzzling crime scene of his career. An entire family has been murdered, and yet, there are no signs of violence. One by one, the gang families of a Los Angeles Barrio are being executed. Along with his new partner, Detective Fernandez, Stone will set out on the trail to find the killer. Along the way, he will uncover a thirty year old murder and a tragic love affair. Can Peter Stone find the killer before he strikes again?",
