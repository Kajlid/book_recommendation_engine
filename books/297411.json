Born into a maximum security prison in the ruins of a future America, life for his fellow inmates has only one purpose: to produce materials for a never-ending war. But Tag isn't like the others.

And who is the strange woman with long black hair and metal legs who appears in his dreams, beckoning him to freedom?",
