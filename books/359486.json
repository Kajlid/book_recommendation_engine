  "description": "Aoi is an exotic dancer and an elf, with a kitsune lover, which makes his life pretty unique to begin with. When Itsuke, Aoi's lover, returns from a business trip, he and Aoi decide they need some time alone, but problems arise in the form of Aya, a young man who claims Aoi is his father. Aoi knows he can't possibly be the young man's father, but he feels sorry for the kid, so he and Itsuke take Aya in. While the three of them explore their new relationship, Aoi's actual family shows up, insisting that he follow the path they've chosen for him. Can Itsuke and Aya help Aoi say no?",
