  "description": "The life of a creative genius isn't all it's cracked up to be, not when said genius is Max Tomlin, hotshot creative director of his own New York ad agency and slightly neurotic headcase. Still reeling after a painful divorce, he's been taking a walk on the gay side, but that hasn't gone much better. At least his agency is in the running for a new account-even if the prospective client is from rural, backward Montana! Max's big-city prejudices go by the wayside when he meets Joe Bennett, aviation innovator and self-made businessman. Joe is smart, passionate, good-looking in a Marlboro Man way, and Max is hopelessly smitten. But business comes first, and Max can't afford any distractions, not when he has an account to win and Joe's legacy to protect. It's going to take all of Max's quick thinking, fast talking and sheer determination to win the account, save Joe's company-and keep their budding relationship from becoming a casualty of corporate warfare.",
