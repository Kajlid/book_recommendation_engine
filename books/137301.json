  "description": "More than just 165 recipes for classic Icelandic dishes, this cookbook explores the evolution of Icelandic cuisine over the last two centuries. From the late 19th century until the 1970s, thick meat stews, roasts, porridges, milk and fruit soups, and various cakes and pastries were popular. More modern trends include making use of the wonderful fresh fish and shellfish in Icelandic waters, sweet-tasting Icelandic lamb, game birds, and local wild herbs. The author includes favorites that have endured through the years and the best of recent dishes that still reflect Icelandic ingredients and cooking methods. Sample such delicacies as \"Iceland Moss Soup,\" \"Grilled Rosemary-Flavored Char,\" \"Braised Wild Goose with Fruit Stuffing,\" and \"Bilberry Ice Cream.\" Home chefs will welcome the helpful chapters on Festive Food Traditions and Icelandic Ingredients. Includes an index in English and in Icelandic.",
