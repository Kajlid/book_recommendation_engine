  "title": "Chasing Proof, Finding Faith: A Young Scientist’s Search for Truth in a World of Uncertainty",
  "description": "He had science and an Ivy League pedigree―why did he need God? Immersed in his physics studies at Cornell, Tom Rudelius never thought much about God until his brother, a new convert to Christianity, challenged him to explore faith. To placate his twin, he reluctantly began exploring the Bible and the life of Jesus. Seeking proof of God’s existence, he found himself in a world of uncertainty, faced with plenty of reasons for both faith and doubt.In Chasing Proof, Finding Faith , Tom, now a rising young theoretical physicist, traces his journey to unexpected faith, through subsequent doubt and anxiety, and ultimately to a firmer, life-transforming allegiance to Jesus. Along the way, he explores some of the issues he wrestled with, includingWhile Tom never found absolute proof of God or Christianity, he ultimately concluded that the existing evidence for both is compelling and compatible with science. His searingly honest story is a potent guide for those doubting or exploring faith.",
