  "description": "First rule in the sister’s handbook: don’t date your sister’s ex-boyfriend.Oops.If there was one man on the planet I shouldn’t be looking at twice, it’s Daire Beneventi. Sure, he’s my sister’s ex, but he’s also the leather jacket to my quilt tote bag. He rides a Harley, frowns at everyone who makes the mistake of glancing at him, and closes real estate deals that have more zeroes than the number of dates I’ve been on recently.He’s all wrong for me, but now I’m tasked with training him at the center we both volunteer at in our off hours. Except, maybe he’s not the man I thought he was. He asks me to teach him how to be kind. I ask him to teach me how to have some adventure.The big question is if this unlikely pairing is worth the backlash from my family. Could we actually ride his motorcycle off into the sunset?",
