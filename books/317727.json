  "title": "For Want of Grace",
  "description": "For Want of Grace is a collection of short fiction that is, like the author, all over the place. Beginning with an homage to the transformational power of the Hammond B3 organ, the stories range from silly to maudlin, whimsical to terrifying, hilarious to melancholy, each punctuated with Harrison's cinematic, lyrical prose. From lizard tail soup to chance meetings with mountain lions, \"necro-rhetoricians,\" horny geriatrics, junky priests, murderous toll-takers and superheroes in the boardroom, For Want of Grace will have you slapping your knee one minute, bawling the next and ultimately pining for a shot of grace.",
