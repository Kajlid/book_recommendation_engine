  "description": "Helena Milton is bored. Rich with everything she ever wanted at her fingertips, she isn’t like other rich girls. Overweight, with a great personality. She has no friends and no prospects for a husband. She enters the Reno, Nevada Christmas Auction looking to alleviate some of her boredom.  Kiernan O’Toole has been through hell and back. Surgery after surgery and he still looks like the monster he has always been. He finds himself at the auction out of sheer frustration. He wasn’t looking for a trophy wife, just someone who could handle his bad attitude and all of his appetites.  Love was never supposed to be on the table.  Life was never supposed to be bearable for these two.  No one ever looks down on you more than yourself.  Item number 467 and paddle number 1268 will burn your Kindle from the inside out.  This safe, steamy, over the top novella is full of all the insta-everything you can handle.",
