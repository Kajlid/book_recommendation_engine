As an adult, Ylenia must come to terms with her deep fear of loss and the significance of how we choose to live our lives.FORWARD is a novel-in-stories, a fragmented and interconnected composite of glimpses and individuals - all of whom remind us of our shared vulnerability, strength, ennui, joy, fear and wilderness.",
