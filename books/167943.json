Via the path of mystery, reversals in fortunes and romantic love, Rosetta and her book club unwittingly get involved in a quest for The Silvering: an epoch rumoured to begin in 2022. The world's concept of worth, however, is keeping alive a body-king-created cycle of suffering, and the chance for a brighter future is fading fast.Beneath the red soil of a southern land lies a glimmer of hope—a legacy of Norwegian forest-dwellers—destined to bring about a worldwide epiphany…but only if two people are heartfelt enough to fulfil Lillibridge’s mystifying prophecy.Discoveries Matthew makes about Edward Lillibridge in the British village of Tintagel (letters the author wrote to his sister and son) align him with Rosetta and her desire to glean clues, but between them stands a wall of mistrust that threatens the sprites' noble plans. Each letter adds further detail to the tapestry of Lillibridge’s 18th-century existence, and Matthew is confronted with an uncanny truth that challenges his perceptions of life and death.",
