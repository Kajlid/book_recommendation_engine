  "description": "A love story that can only end in tragedy...She was never part of the plan. She was never to become anything.She was simply a payment, and once the debt was settled, she would be nothing to me.She thought her life had changed in a blink of an eye the moment she came home to see her father strapped to a chair, a gun being held to his head. It was my life that changed that day, not hers.The blood of my enemy ran through her veins, and no matter how much she wanted to save me, she never would have. I am a monster. I can't be saved. I would consume the world in a blaze of fire before my need for vengeance was ever fulfilled.They say the truth will set you freeâ€¦I thought she had betrayed me in ways I never expected, but in the end, it was I who had committed the ultimate betrayal. Doubts ruin, truths hurt, and just one lie can destroy an entire army. If being the king has taught me anything, it's that everyone desires the truth, but no one wants to be honest.The monster inside of me has been set free, and I will stop at nothing to destroy my enemies.I am a living, breathing, killing machine... This war has just begun.",
