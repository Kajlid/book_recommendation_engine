  "description": "Art is therapy, a healing process. Each layer of an oil painting require tipping the brush ever so slightly to get the effect you desire. Other times you may find yourself blotting the canvas with color. It depends on the day, your mood, your attitude, experience. Can you observe the sunlight fading, my friend? Night prowls. Every single minute counts.",
