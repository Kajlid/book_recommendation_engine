  "description": "A courtesan afraid of true love...Youth and beauty are a courtesan's greatest assets. At forty-one, Lady Ruth Attwood appears to have lost both, as her latest lover just abandoned her for a younger mistress. Struggling with the knowledge that she's no longer considered desirable, she's uncertain whether to be offended or flattered when a younger man makes her an unusual offer. In need of funds, she agrees. But then she does the unthinkable. She falls in love.And a gentleman ashamed of his true nature...Despite his reputation as a man's man, Baron Garrick Stratfield has never been with a woman. His physical impairment is such that he knows not even a whore will touch him, and he needs a mistress who's willing to be kept without sharing his bed. But passion is just a delicious kiss away, because his new mistress is wreaking havoc with his senses. Worse yet, someone is not only out to ruin his reputation, but frame him for murder.",
