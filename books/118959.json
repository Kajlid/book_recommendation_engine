  "title": "Magnificent Obesity: My Search for Wellness, Voice and Meaning in the Second Half of Life",
  "description": "Lose weight, calm down, find God.  Priorities fall quickly into place for a 55-year-old compulsive overeater with a panic disorder when a heart attack accelerates a midlife crisis into a furious race to close the gap between where she appears to be going in life and the very different place she wants to be. Hindered by numerous longstanding obstacles to wellness and wholeness-from an obsessive fear of death to a two pack-a-day smoking habit-writer Martha Moravec turns crisis into opportunity, loss into insight and the pain of her past into a means for growing up in time to grow old with grace. A woman living alone, Martha recruits a support team of doctors, therapists, and priests, helpers, healers, and friends from the grid of small town life. The patience and dedication of the people she calls “angels we can see” proves that it takes a village to raise a self-actualized adult. As she addresses childhood trauma, multiple addictions, severe panic attacks and phobias, Martha walks an often painful but always illuminating path toward recovery, reinvention and rebirth.\nMagnificent Obesity \ndepicts one woman’s effort to look honestly and compassionately at her obesity through a kaleidoscopic lens of anxiety disorder, addictive behaviors, agnosticism and the onset of aging. Her conviction that it’s never too late to grow up, that it is possible to feel born again at any age, and that there is no expiration date on dreams will inspire anyone who yearns to rewrite their story and take their own magnificent leap into a life lived with passion, purpose, and authentic power.",
