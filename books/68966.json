Soon, with the help of private investigator Marisol Solis, he learns that there is something more sinister going on at the bayou than a chemical spill—secret work at a hidden facility that stretches the bounds of known science. Secret work worth killing for.But who is behind the conspiracy? And what is its ultimate goal? Mad science for mere profit? Or do the shadowy figures at work in the facility have a grander aim—to transform the world into a dystopian nightmare?Geoff and Marisol’s race to answer these questions takes them to New Orleans, a maniacal hit man on their trail. As the conspiracy nears fruition, the boy—the special, unearthly boy—emerges at its epicenter.
