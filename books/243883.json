  "description": "Prayer is personal conversation directly with God. Me and You, Lord supports growth in each young child's relationship with God through prayer. Each prayer is designed for personalization by the child, encouraging thoughtfulness when we share our heart with the Lord. Your child can choose who and what to pray for. The child can pray specifically for friends, family members, teachers, pets, and so much more! There is a Parent's Corner on each page that helps foster bond-strengthening discussion between parent and child. These are special moments to share your heart with your child. In Me and You, Lord, there is a table of wonderful Biblical role models that your child can explore further with Bible passages. For your young ones, there are Word Boxes that have various Nouns, Adjectives and Verbs to help them find the words they are looking for when they are at a loss for it. Enjoy reading with your child and discover a whole new way of prayer.Me and You, Lord is the perfect gift for your children, grandchildren and all the children in your life so they may grow closer in Christ through thoughtful prayer.",
