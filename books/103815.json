But there's a big Israel has no viable plan to attack Iran without American help. Frustration grows and time passes as the Israeli Defense Forces are mired in conventional thinking.

The radical concept is embraced by Prime Minister Cohen and his small group of advisors known as the Kitchen Cabinet.
