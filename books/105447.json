It’s a reality overflowing with scary monsters, death, and betrayal—a past she left behind when she entered her new foster home. Now, with a loving family, a sister she’s always craved, and relief from the gruesome corpses that tormented her as a child, she’s finally content. Until a freak accident changes everything.The monsters are back, and their mission is simple: drag Lia straight to their murky hell. When Aiden, an apparition, appears to Lia, she has hope once again. Because Aiden can cross the veil between the spirit world and the earthly dimension, physically fighting off the monsters and sending them back. With Aiden’s determination to keep her safe and his absorbing blue eyes, Lia can’t help falling in love with him. But who is he, and what does he really want? As Lia and Aiden’s relationship deepens, so does the mystery surrounding him. Once Lia finds out Aiden has traded his soul to save her, she enters the darker dimension, a dimension where nightmares are reality, ready to kick some serious butt. But surrounded by twenty-eight mutilated monsters and a deranged cult leader intent on bringing his dark world to the surface, isn’t what Lia expects. And even worse, she must face her traumatic past in order to destroy them. If she fails, not only will she lose the guy she loves and face certain death, but she will also risk the one thing she can’t afford to lose: her eternal soul.",
