  "description": "Helpless is a Born Assassin prequel novella set twenty years before the events of Merciless and may be read in any order.\n\nAfter the sudden death of beloved King Alaric, Prince Ghyslain is thrust before the eyes of the nation in an unexpected--and undesired--coronation. With the future of his new kingdom resting heavily upon his shoulders, Ghyslain wants nothing more than to do the one thing his father never dared during his rule: to free the elven slaves. In a city plagued by racial tension, opposing the demanding, cutthroat advisors and courtiers seems an impossible task until Ghyslain meets Liselle, the one woman who is brave enough to stand against them all.",
