  "description": "Bridger Payne is an enigma that no one can figure out. Wise beyond his years, eerily intuitive and sexy as hell, every woman in The Silo wants him.  None can have him. Not the real man, anyway.  He might wield the lash for you if you ask prettily, but he’ll get no gratification from it. He’ll definitely make you scream, but he won’t think twice about you when he walks away.  Bridger carries the darkest of secrets. He’s filled with too much pain. He’s utterly untouchable.  Until she came along.",
