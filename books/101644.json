  "description": "Frank Bowen decides to change his life and travel to Goa where he meets the seemingly friendly Theo and the woman of his dreams, Maria.  In Bangkok, he is pointed in the direction of Theo's friend – Richard – an English ex-pat with dubious connections and knowledge of the seedier side of the city. Richard gains his trust and Frank decides to take up a proposition—to take part in an anti-terrorist drill in Hong Kong.  That drill soon turns into a nightmare.  Plenty of twists and turns in this first, high-octane, conspiracy thriller, from Jay Tinsiano.",
