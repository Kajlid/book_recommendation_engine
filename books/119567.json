  "title": "The 3-Day Herpes Cure - A Proven Natural Method to Stopping Outbreaks From Ever Happening Again",
  "description": "Herpes can ruin your life.I've experienced it myself and seen it in countless others. Through years of ridicule and rejection, I had become extremely self-conscious of my herpes blisters. In my 20s I contracted genital herpes and it was devastating for my self-esteem. I would frequently have blisters and itchy spots on my penis. I fell into a deep depression. I was disgusted by myself and thought I would never have sex again. Not only because of my personal embarrassment, but because I didn’t want to endanger innocent girls by giving them this disease. I wanted to murder the girl that gave it to me.These negative experiences led me to search for a way to treat herpes as effectively as possible. I tried creams, tablets, alternative cures, I bought every “herpes guide” I could find online. Nothing really worked. The creams usually prescribed actually made it worse. They made the blisters dry out and hurt badly. The herpes guides claiming a “one minute herpes cure” were complete garbage and potentially harmful to your health. It seemed like I would have to live with this embarrassment forever.Then, after thousands of hours of research, I found one ingredient that kept being mentioned over and over. I combined this with a few other supplements that studies indicated may work, and created my own regimen that has kept me free of herpes outbreaks for 5 years now. In the process, it has improved my overall health as well.This book is the result of thousands of hours of research over a period of many years.I want to help as many people suffering from this disease, so they can have this burden lifted from their bodies and minds.",
