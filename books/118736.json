  "description": "B.R.A.G. MEDALLION HONOREEFor two years, England has been in the grip of Civil War. In Banbury, Oxfordshire, the Cavaliers hold the Castle, the Roundheads want it back and the town is full of zealous Puritans. Consequently, the gulf between Captain Justin Ambrose and Abigail Radford, the sister of a fanatically religious shopkeeper, ought to be unbridgeable. The key to both the fate of the Castle and that of Justin and Abigail lies in defiance ... but will it be enough? A Splendid Defiance is a dramatic and enchanting story of forbidden love, set against the turmoil and anguish of the first English Civil War. Though not a sequel to The Black Madonna, this novel is linked to it through character and taking place at the same time.Stella Riley is the 2019 Readers’ Favorite Gold Medallist for Historical Romance and proud to have been awarded 14 B.R.A.G. medallions.“Stella Riley gave me a rare gift. She wholly enveloped me in the world she created. A Splendid Defiance offers so much. A realistic and expertly drawn setting; laughter, sorrow and exquisite joy. Most of all, a slow-building, believable romance which may have been the most touching I've ever read.”“A moving love story in an authentic historical background.” “A fantastic read you’ll return to over and over again.” “Definitely a page turner!”",
