  "description": "Rachel Winslow didn’t mean to spark the legend of Regina Silsby. After witnessing the Boston Tea Party, Rachel is chased into a nearby cemetery by British troops. When the spooked soldiers are unable to find her, they believe they were attacked by the ghost of Regina Silsby. The story might have ended there if Rachel hadn’t donned the personae to rescue her brother and the Sons of Liberty. With the single-minded Capt. Dudley hunting her down, Rachel’s escapades are too dangerous to continue―and too important to stop. The adventure continues in Regina Silsby’s Phantom Militia.",
