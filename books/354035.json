  "title": "Kissing Alice",
  "description": "Arthur Craythorne has barely married Queenie May when he is called away to fight in the First World War; when he returns from the trenches, he is a changed man. He struggles to contain the violent flashes of anger he confuses with love; and his two young daughters, Florrie and Alice, strive hard to please the stranger who calls himself their father... A moving tale of family, love and loss set against the unfolding of twentieth century English life, Kissing Alice was shortlisted for the 2010 McKitterick Prize and singled out by the judges of the Orange Award for New Writers on account of 'its compelling story and fine prose'. The dark and disturbing story of a family in which the ties of love and hate, fear and jealousy, innocence and experience, have all become dangerously confused, Kissing Alice is a 'remarkable first novel'.",
