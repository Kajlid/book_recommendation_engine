  "description": "It's a glorious day in Woodcock Pocket. The sun is shining, the birds are singing . . . and Toot is moping. So, Puddle makes Toot's favorite dessert at dinnertime, takes him out for a little adventure, and even throws a party, but nothing seems to cheer up his friend. Then a big thunderstorm with lots of mud rocks Woodcock Pocket and changes everything. With light-hearted humor and exquisitely detailed watercolor paintings, Holly Hobbie tells the story of two pigs and their enduring friendship.",
