  "title": "Eric Elmoor and The Chalice of Cameron",
  "description": "Nearly a year has passed since the Battle of Fairwood, but the images of that day have been haunting Eric's dreams ever since. Ben arrives back in Gondlair to warn Eric of their enemy's resolve and to offer him a chance to resume his training. Wishing for some sort of normality, Eric turns down the offer. But when Derex returns to attack his school, Eric comes face-to-face with a cold reality: He cannot escape the darkness spreading across Novogard. Setting out for the dwarf city of Eohton, he finds that the elves have become refugees - exiled from their own land. It is here where he will continue his tutelage under Warwick Wargrim. However, Lillian Scarlight is never too far from Eric's mind. As time ticks by, the intentions of their enemy becomes all too dire. Loyalties will be tested, blood will be spilt, and an unforeseen alliance will shake Novogard to its very core.",
