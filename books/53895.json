  "description": "Out of print A runaway slave boy, the Underground Railroad, a land without shadows. Robbed of his emancipation by his master's widow, a literate 14-year-old slave boy flees into the prairie. His journey crosses a territory ripped apart in conflict over slavery: stolen elections, printing presses thrown in the river, church houses nailed shut. But folk stories and campfire songs help him find conductors on the Underground Railroad. Slavecatchers dog his trail, but before the runaway can cross the river to freedom, he must first place his faith in an illiterate freewoman.",
