  "description": "Adam Watson's debut book of poetry has an save verse from itself. By using an eclectic style that fuses modern and classic forms, Watson challenges the notion that poetry today must be academic, emotionless, or difficult to understand. \"I am not against poems making you think,\" he writes in his foreward. \"I am against poems not making you feel.\"With photography by Douglas Staley.",
