  "description": "The last thing he needs is another person he has to protect…  Tim Means is the sheriff on the White Sandy Reservation—a thankless job on the best of days. He’s trying to keep a gang war from breaking out, vigilantes from running amuck and he’s doing it all with a two-man force. When a kid named Georgey gets busted breaking into the Clinic, Tim doesn’t have time to keep the kid on the straight and narrow. He needs a relative to take the teen off his hands.  But who? The only person who could take custody of Georgey is Summer Collins, Georgey’s half-sister. She hasn’t been on the White Sandy in almost fifteen years . But what choice does she have? She made a promise to her father to look out for her little brother, so she gives up her job teaching summer school and her hopes of a summer fling to venture west and meet a brother she barely remembers. But what she finds on the White Sandy is more than just a family or a sense of belonging. She meets one sexy sheriff and suddenly, a summer fling seems like just the thing.  But things on the White Sandy are never simple—or easy. When the gang war threatens Summer and her brother, will Tim be able to do his job—or will his heart get in the way?  Warning: This book features smart-mouthed teenagers, poverty issues, dyslexia, jackalopes, and car sex. Plan accordingly!",
