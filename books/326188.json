  "description": "Terrorists use a free vaccination trailer as a front to infect the desert city of Oasis with a virus that has the power to kill the mind and take over the body. The next morning the power grid goes down. The government quarantines the city, but doesn't send aid, and nobody can understand why. Meanwhile, the infected begin to walk, mindlessly spreading the zombie virus to every corner of town. Corbin St. Laurent is an emergency room nurse with a will to survive, a little attitude, and the worst luck imaginable. During this crises he's plagued by hunger, thirst, fatigue, lack of safe shelter, a teenage hussy, one unstoppable virus, and hordes upon hordes of infected men & women. Sure, he's cool under pressure, but how much punishment can one man take? \"It gives for a good creepy feeling as you're turning the pages to this novel. And you will be turning the pages... really damn hard to put down.\" - Dr. Pus from the Library of the Living Dead \"Oasis is good ol' fashioned pulp fiction, complete with punchy style, taut action and fights for survival.\" - J. Dane Tyler \"Oasis is a wicked thrill ride that keeps readers on their toes. Excellent read.\" - Donna C. \"Peligrie\" \"Oasis ... is easily one of the most invigorating thrill rides in its genre.\" - Cal A.",
