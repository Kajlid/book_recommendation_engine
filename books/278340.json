  "description": "Publication May 1976 | 0393092089 | 978-0393092080 | 1st Goethe's masterpiece and perhaps the greatest work in German literature, \"Faust\" has made the legendary German alchemist one of the central myths of the Western world. Here indeed is a monumental Faust, an audacious man boldly wagering with the devil, Mephistopheles, that no magic, sensuality, experience or knowledge can lead him to a moment he would wish to last forever. Here, in \"Faust,\" \"Part 1,\" the tremendous versatility of Goethe's genius creates some of the most beautiful passages in literature. Here too we experience Goethe's characteristic humor, the excitement and eroticism of the witches' Walpurgis Night, and the moving emotion of Gretchen's tragic fate.",
