From his sexy bedroom eyes to his black leather jacket and dusty jeans, he spells trouble, but so does the nasty-looking biker gang that surrounds them. Within minutes, Tess is on the back of Dallas's Harley, and at the mercy of a man who breaks through all of her defenses and makes her want him--good or bad, right or wrong.AN UNLIKELY SAVIOR IN LEATHER AND JEANSDallas's mission doesn't need another complication, yet from the moment he sees her he wants her with a rough, hungry passion that can hurt them both. Claiming her and abducting her is the only way to protect her from the gang. Then all hell breaks loose, and Dallas and Tess are on the run with no place to hide--except in each other's arms.",
