  "description": "Multicultural Paranormal Shape-shifter True Mates; Previous Nikolai's WolfSix weeks ago, Shayla Morgan, geek extraordinaire, fled the tiny mountain town of Refuge, North Carolina as though the hounds of hell--or one horny werewolf--were on her tail. Now the time has come to return for her cousin’s wedding and face the piper in the form of one determined, red-haired wolf-shifter who believes she’s his mate.After the hell of his childhood, Rory McFelan, alpha of the Sparrowhawks, determined never to mate or reproduce. That was before the Creator dropped one feisty, irritating human female with a scent his wolf wouldn’t let him ignore into his path right before a blue moon. In the few short days it took the blue moon to wane, Rory found himself mated with a pup on the way, and his mate gone.Getting her back is the easy part. Keeping her is more difficult. He’ll have to fight demons--his and hers--his pack, her family, and an unknown enemy determined to destroy him, any way they can.Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find sex in shifted form.",
