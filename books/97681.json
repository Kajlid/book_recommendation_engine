Overwhelmed with organizing a Yuletide celebration and her sister's wedding, Cat gladly accepts Jonathan's help. Soon she sees the gentle heart he conceals beneath his wit. But Jonathan's need to prove himself could drive them apartâ€”unless they're bold enough to seize the unexpected gift of love. Sanctuary Bay: Where three war heroes find the healing power of love",
