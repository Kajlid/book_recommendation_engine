Until she meets Lee, a man also deeply wronged by Kurev. Cyn's new problem? Lee.Lee is stealing her revenge and screwing with the carefully carved life she’s made for herself. As if his mere presence and counter-productive ambitions weren’t enough, he’s going to get her caught…The FBI has been on her tail for several years now, but they haven’t even come close to finding her. Cyn has been leaving fake evidence at her crime scenes and counting on the one thing the FBI hasn’t figured out yet… Their most wanted criminal is just a girl.Vengeance is the first book in the Vendetta Trifecta.
