  "description": "\"Outlander, with a gothic romance twist'' - Amazon ReviewerOn the morning of her wedding, Roma awakens to find that a 21st-century eclipse has swept her through time and space to medieval Ireland—a land bedevilled with strife, conflict and danger at every possible turn. Soon caught up in an intricate spider’s web of political intrigue, Roma is forced to ally herself and marry a man she passionately hates—a cocky, rugged, silver-tongued Irish warrior—and the only man who can protect her from the dark forces at work on the Emerald Isle… For under the rolling green hills of the ancient Irish countryside lies a powerful force that even today is only spoken of in hushed tones. And as the war deepens, Roma finds herself falling for the one man she swore that she never would—her husband, Fionn, whose fierce passion drives her crazy despite herself. Roma’s a very long way from home—but her battle has only just begun, and now she needs Fionn’s help more than ever to succeed…and craves his touch more than ever to survive. Rich in historical detail and spine-tingling, gothic suspense prepare to be swept back in time to the lush mythology, epic legends, mysterious, windswept moors and Celtic magic of \nSTARLARK’s\n medieval Ireland—and the spellbinding gothic romance tale of a love so absolute it transcends time itself…",
