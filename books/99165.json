  "description": "After a devastating global pandemic, the world has gone quiet. She hasnâ€™t seen another living soul for weeks, just the piles of corpses lining the streets. With an enthusiastic dog named Scram, a photo of her wife, and the memory of an old friend at her side, she hikes across Europe to answer one question: has her family survived? An unsettling presence watches her from the shadows. As she walks through empty cities being reclaimed by nature, she grows less certain that the yellow-eyed creature is just a figment of her imagination. What Survives takes readers on a gripping journey of grief, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of life.",
