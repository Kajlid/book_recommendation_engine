When he's cast as the male lead, he expects to escape his own life for a while and become a different person. What he gets instead is the role of a Kit Webster. In the play, Kit's thrown together with Lindsay Walsh, the female lead and the school's teen queen. Lindsay, tired of the shallow and selfish boys from her usual circle of friends, sees something real in Kit - and wants it. But Kit's attention is focused on Pablo, another boy in school. The play is controversial; the parents put pressure on the school to shut it down. And when Kit and Lindsay rally to save Talk, they find themselves deep into a battle for the onstage, and inside themselves.As in her other books, Ms. Koja's \"long stream-of-consciousness sentences with creative (but recognizable) spelling and clever use of italics will enchant readers\" ( Booklist ).",
