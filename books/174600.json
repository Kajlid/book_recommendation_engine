  "description": "'Don't chicken out' - those three little words are at the top of Rosa's list of resolutions. Sure, she's never before kept any of her past resolutions for even a week, but she is determined that this year it will be different. As soon as Master Marshall announced that a Charity Auction would be held to honor one of the Castle's founding Masters, Don, Rosa knew it was fate. As an employee of the Castle, that marvelous place where any and all dreams and fantasies can become reality, she knows that this is the time to pursue her dream. Time to remove her Nanny uniform and don the clothes she has been dreaming of wearing for as long as she can remember.This New Year's Eve, she will stand on the stage and pray that someone will bid for her and want to be her Daddy. The moment the gavel falls, Rosa becomes Rosie - the Little girl who will spend the next few days discovering what it's like to be taken care of, to be cuddled, and loved... not only by a handsome, wonderful Daddy, but, to her immense surprise, by a beautiful, loving Mommy as well...Will she discover that being Little isn't all fun and games? Will she admit when she's been naughty - remembering that breaking rules has painful consequences for her backside? Will she keep her resolutions long enough to find the answers she seeks? And even if she doesn't chicken out, will her heart be able to pay the price?Originally part of the \"When the Gavel Falls\" Box Set Collection released in January 2015...5 full-length \"Masters of the Castle\" novels",
