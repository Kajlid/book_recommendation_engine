  "description": "Meet Chad, the third of five unforgettable characters in the Emerald Springs Legacy.Life in the small town of Emerald Springs, Washington, is anything but slow and peaceful. An old feud between former business partners Whitman and Sanders keeps competition on a high burner, fueling resentment, renewing rivalries … and love. Now someone is trying to bring down Emerald Tea Farm, and it’s up to both families to protect their future while still wrangling over the past.Chad Whitman loves his family, but he’s not entirely sure he shares their responsible, deliberate outlook on life. Where’s the excitement and passion in that? Running the family diner has been moderately fulfilling, but with his father retiring from the tea farming business, he needs to get a direction. After being unfairly fired from her dream job, Jen Chavez picks up her worst nightmare in the parking lot—a rich guy she thought was just another pretty face. She has no intention of turning out like her mother, latching on to wealthy men for self-worth and survival. She doesn’t need a man. She needs a job. Chad decides turning the diner into a microbrewery will provide the excitement his life lacks, and he knows just the person to help him with the job. But hiring Jen as a consultant to the project has its drawbacks. He has a reputation for messing around with the wrong women, and his family is watching his every move. As days pass, his desire to open a top-notch microbrewery is matched only by his desire for Jen. Can they overcome their backgrounds to make this microbrewery a dream big enough for both of them?",
