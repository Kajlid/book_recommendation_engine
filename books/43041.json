  "title": "You Never Have to Remember the Truth: The Nick Gugliatto Story",
  "description": "It was one of the most sensational murder cases in U.S. history. Lawrencia \"Bambi\" Bembenek, a former Playboy waitress and ex-Milwaukee police officer, was arguably railroaded and convicted of murder. When all hope of proving her innocence seemed lost, she planned a daring escape from a Wisconsin prison with her boyfriend, and together the lovers slipped into Canada under assumed names. Now, nearly twenty years after the escape, Dominic Gugliatto wants to set the record straight. The man who laid it all on the line tells a different tale - one of deception and betrayal. For the first time, Gugliatto speaks out about the corruption, lies, and secrets long buried. That Bembenek knew more about the murder than she professed, and that the prison escape involved co-conspirators both inside and outside the prison's walls, including a retired Milwaukee police officer. It's the whole truth that the public has demanded for over two decades, told by the only man who knows it all.",
