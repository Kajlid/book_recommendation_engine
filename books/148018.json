  "description": "THE DOZIER Part One – Tom Newberry takes leave from the detective agency he opened with his NYPD partner, Barry Noonan, to become the Police Chief in a small beach town on Long Island’s south shore, leaving Noonan in charge of the agency while he’s gone. Tom is pressed into action his first day on the job when a first-ever murder is committed in the sleepy beach town over the Memorial Day weekend. FIRST LET’S KILL ALL THE Part Two - Barry Noonan receives a frantic call from Angelo Manetti, an attorney who supplies a good portion of the work for the agency. Manetti’s dear friend and law associate Jimmy Rizzo was found dead in his office that morning and Manetti feels the detectives in the Forest Hills precinct aren’t up to the task of finding Rizzo’s killer. THE BOUNTY Part Three - With a sudden uptick in business, Barry Noonan is forced to bring on a new investigator – Harry O’Rourke, a former NYPD detective with a checkered past. O’Rourke goes to the Bronx, his least favorite borough, to track down Ron Boom-Boom Bibby, a professional boxer-turned-burglar who skipped out on his bail. On their way back to Queens, O’Rourke spots a van wanted in connection with the abduction of a wealthy Manhattan socialite earlier that day. After giving the information to the Bronx detective, O’Rourke and Bibby join the chase. Author's Note : Final Punishment was originally published in 2014 as three intermingled who-done-its. The book has been separated into a trilogy of three stories.",
