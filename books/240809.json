  "title": "ONE: How Male Allies Support Women for Gender Equality",
  "description": "Women leaders still are paid 83% of what their male counterparts are paid, and account for only 5% of CEO’s in the United States. Organizations with gender equality on average earn a 16% higher profitability rate. To be the highest performing organizations possible, we need women and men at the top leading together. That means working collaboratively side-by-side, as true allies, to get this done. Our title ONE is a symbol of this inclusion, men and women together, united on gender challenges, for both men and women. To be true allies, we did our research and found a set of proven strategies, ideas, and stories for men and women to partner together – heart, story, speak, and work-life. When men and women leaders employ these strategies together, they work in lock step, facilitating success. When we use a common approach and common language, we become ONE.",
