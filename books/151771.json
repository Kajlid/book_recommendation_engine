Broke, out of work and on the verge of losing their wives and children, they come up with a desperate, brilliant plan: Make like Chippendale dancers and strip for cash!The Full Monty is the story of a last-ditch attempt by a group of working-class men to redeem themselves as reliable in the eyes of their community. In scenes as hysterical as they are tender, they discover that \"the full monty\" requires more than dexterity, a fit body and the right moves; and that the confidence they need can only come from stripping bare the deeper issues that trouble their individual lives. The result is a humane, triumphant comedy that has won the hearts of millions around the world.In her novel based on the critically acclaimed box-office hit, Wendy Holden revisits our favorite moments -- both hilarious and heartwarming -- from The Full Monty.",
