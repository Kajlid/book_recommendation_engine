  "description": "It was certainly not the reception Lady Vesta Cressington-Font had expected.As soon as she left her ship and set foot on the small Mediterranean island of Katona, the blue-eyed, exquisitely-beautiful Vesta felt frightened and totally alone. Where, she wondered, were Prince Alexander's representatives? Surely His Royal Highness would not let his future bride arrive in Katona without a formal greeting. Really, it was quite unthinkable: traveling all the way from England to marry a man she had never met and then being rudely abandoned...\"The tell me you have arrived alone.\"The words cut across Vestra's indignant reverie. Startled, she directed her gaze toward the man who spoke them. His stern, domineering manner, his penetrating glance alarmed her. And yet he was so darkly handsome...\"I am Count Miklos Czako,\" the stranger continued harshly. \"I will take you to His Royal Highness.\"",
