Beltway won't do a damn bit of good for those problems, but his beach house in Montauk is exactly where he needs to be right now. April Veach has plans.Work plans, travel plans, try-everything-once plans. Montauk is keeping her plenty busy this summer between decorating wedding cakes and teaching yoga, and busy is good. But busy is also a lonely bed, and that wasn't part of her grand plan. After a weekend together, his problems and her plans take them in an unexpected direction.",
