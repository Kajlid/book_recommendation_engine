  "title": "Biggles In France",
  "description": "Biggles is back! And with new retro-style covers he's bigger than ever!.A burst of bullets struck Biggles' machine somewhere just behind him, and he jerked the control-stick back into his stomach. A Hun shot past his wing-tip, so close that Biggles flinched.'That's too close!' he muttered. 'Where the dickens are the S. E.'s?'Biggles battles through the First World War, honing his flying skills in terrifying battles against the finest fighters the enemy can supply. But he finds war provides more light-hearted adventures as well, and this collection of stories from early in Biggles' career combines the fun of being part of 266 squadron and the fear of deadly serious aerial combat.",
