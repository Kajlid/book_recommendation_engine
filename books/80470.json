Living the dance was no longer the only important thing in my life.The City opened my eyes, but he transformed me.Two dancers. One big city. He was determined to make a new start. She was ready to make it in the ballet world. Neither expected love to play a part in achieving their dreams. They also didn't expect it to be so destructive.
