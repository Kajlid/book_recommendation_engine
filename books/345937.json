  "description": "In the emergent Nigerian city of Monamona, a scourge once eradicated has resurfaced--a terrible disease reintroduced into the world by a fanatic who may or may not be athanor: Shopona, the one time God of Smallpox. Conquering Aferica with plague is only the first step in this madman's dream of power. There are those who oppose him, and they will need the help of the shapeshifter Changer--Perhaps the Earth's oldest being--to prevail. But Changer has problems of his own: a wild daughter, Shahrazad--a free spirit, unchained and indomitable, testing the limits of her powers against new realities in a new world. And even the combined efforts of Athur, the Changer, and Shahrazad may not be enough. For the fanatic master of disease is not only creature of legend who seeks to walk like a god among men.",
