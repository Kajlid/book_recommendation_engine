  "description": "I’ve wanted Andrea since the moment I saw her.  But she’s human. I’m drakoni. The only way I’ll stay sane and not lose myself to the madness that’s swept over my people is if I keep my mental walls strong. I have to give up everything that makes me a dragon. That means no telepathy, no fire breathing, and no battle form.  I certainly can’t take a mate. Andrea can’t be mine.  When her brother escapes the fort, though, she needs help tracking him down. That means I’ll be alone with her, breathing in her sweet scent, and it may be too much for my control.  What happens if I give in to my dragon? Will I take her as my mate…or tear her throat out?",
