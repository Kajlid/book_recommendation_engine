  "description": "Our story didn’t exist, it was broken before it began.Kisses were covered with lies.Lies were covered with kisses.Hate turned into lust.And lust turned into fantasy.That’s what we were, a fantasy.Nothing more, nothing less.Now it’s time to move on. But how can you when your heart wants to say stuck in the fantasy?When even through all the lies and kisses, you still have lust.",
