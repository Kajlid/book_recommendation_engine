  "description": "For Savannah, it was an easy choice; getting sent to the Compound meant she and Kayden could be together. But nothing is ever that simple. Caught in a system that encourages cruelty and mind games; will their love survive?This is book two in the In Chains series and continues the story of Kayden and Savannah. I would recommend reading book one first as this is not a standalone. Please note: this book contains strong language.",
