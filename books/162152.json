  "description": "Delia Spencer has the perfect life, a husband who loves her, a satisfying career, and two teenage daughters. Then there is a terrible accident, and that life disappears in a puff of smoke. Everyone keeps telling her to \"move on\", but how does one move on from the death of a child? How does one restart the clock when they are frozen in time? When nothing in her world is intact, Delia must find some new reason to awaken to the day, something to hold on to that propels her forward, some way in which to escape her life and her guilt. When she cannot find any answers in her present, she steps back into her past. The best way to move on might be to reach back.",
