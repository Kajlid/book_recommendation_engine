  "description": "The “achingly beautiful” story of Immortal North concludes in this stunning sequel, an unflinching meditation on the triumph of human resolve.He’s known as the trapper and his family has a long history in these remote woods. Now it’s just him and the boy, and he’ll raise him in the world he knows, the forest, where threats take recognizable forms: harsh weather, peak predators, the intrusion of civilization at odds with their lifestyle. But for those lands and minds with an unsettled past, other dangers may lurk the woods where father and son hunt the timber. One fateful day their woodland life is violently broken—shouldn’t those guilty of such injustice be held to account? The forest in all its naked majesty becomes an arena for the dueling forces of life: joy and suffering, good and evil, compassion and vengeance. The aftermath of the first novel becomes too volatile to be contained by the woods, and now the town knows of a murder and an abduction—that list of crimes is not getting any shorter. An atmospheric tale both haunting and heartening. When to that northern woods tragedies arrive with such a darkness that even the patch of sky above their old family cabin seems to have lost its stars, hope and courage have this luminous sequel shining with radiant light.",
