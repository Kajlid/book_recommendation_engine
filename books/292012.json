The shadow fae believe in strange visions that foretell of the upcoming war. If Reyna helps them, they will win. If she refuses, their realm will fall.  The High King gives her an ultimatum. She must become his warrior, or he will kill Princess Eislyn. Reyna has no choice but to kneel to the cruel king. She would do anything to save her sister, even fight by the side of her former lover.
