  "description": "Yokoi is a manga artist who spends his nights delivering newspapers just to make rent, since his original works just don't seem to sell. Suddenly, one day he gets a visit from Saito-san, a self-proclaimed fan of Yokoi's work who made the long journey to meet him. Yokoi quickly realizes that the things Saito-san sees, feels, and thinks about are different from most people... These two struggle together to find a place to belong in this unique slice-of-life!",
