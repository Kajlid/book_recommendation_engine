  "description": "Tina is a successful bakery owner and is happy with her current boyfriend until her new tenant shows up. He’s a blast from her past and not in a good way. Tina crushed on him all through school even though he tormented her and stood her up for prom. Why is he so appealing again especially since he is an arrogant jerk? Mac is an alpha that recently moved back into the area after his pack dissolved. He recognizes his mate as the woman he bullied from grade school to graduation. Can he convince her that he’s not the same jerk from so long ago? Or will he be left without a mate because of the mistakes he made before he was an alpha?",
