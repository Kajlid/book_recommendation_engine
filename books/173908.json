  "description": "She has been banished from the city to a remote area and a murdered girl lands on her doorstep … Danielle has always been 'linked' to others so when her links were cut and she was banished from the city it was a shock in more ways than one. She no longer had fast access to information, food, friends … anything. Now she will fend for herself and she is notorious for having been part of an experimental type of linking with 3 others. They are either dead or dead to Danielle anyway. Then, soon after moving in, an injured young girl turns up on her doorstep … the girl soon dies and Danielle cannot let go of the mystery of her death. With Neil, who lives in a neighbouring commune, she begins to make enquiries at places all over the countryside and starts suspecting that someone is making illegal modifications to humans … could it be that vampirism is becoming a trait in some humans from this illegal activity. And, if so, how far has it gone … can Danielle find the source before they are all dead.",
