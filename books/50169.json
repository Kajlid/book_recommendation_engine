  "title": "The Comfort of Strangers",
  "description": "On holiday in an ancient city, Colin and Mary are irritable. The heat is oppressive. They are growing weary of each other, tired of roaming the endlessly winding streets. One night they set out late in search of a restaurant and lose their way in the town’s narrow, shadowy passages. Suddenly Robert appears before them. Forceful, insistent, he leads them through the city and away from their ordinary lives—forever.Ian McEwan is a master of the fascinating, the erotic, the horrifying. His story is dangerously intimate, bizarre, yet, through his skilled telling, inevitable. It is as irresistible to the reader as Robert and his enigmatic wife, Caroline, are to Colin and Mary.",
