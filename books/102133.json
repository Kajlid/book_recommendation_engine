Can Layla and Seth keep up the façade in Chapel Springs this holiday season—for the sake of her career...and his heart?Under normal circumstances, Seth Murphy—the best friend of Layla O’Reilly’s ex-fiancé—would be the last person she’d marry.

Maybe she’ll never forgive him for the way he hurt her back then, but he has to try. And Layla is willing to keep up their engagement farce until she’s landed her client.For Layla, it’s the chance to save her career. But for Seth, it’s his last chance to win her heart.",
