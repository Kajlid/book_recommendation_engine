  "title": "Theresa: her secret loves and amorous adventures",
  "description": "This is a novella-pie in a baker’s ditsy dozen chapters of her life, written by Louise Lucy Lockhart.As Theresa says: \"Me too, about time to embarrass and harass, to name and to shame, as part of the game, Viva la difference, and what is the rational sequel? Coupled in life forever, but logically absolutely equal!\" These narratives are conceived for refined gentle souls. They are sexy but not dirty. It describes a healthy narrative of pleasurable orgasms as experienced by a girl who discovers her own sexuality. The erotic experiences are wild yet constrained, salacious but salubrious, adventurous yet calculated. With few expletives, but accurate descriptions, this Theresa narrative will titillate the reader. “When she turned herself out for the races, she looked ravishing. She wore stylish hats, often with osprey, colored peacock or other feathers, and with her curled blonde hair and fluffed collars, she looked like a glamorous femme fatale or film star.” From Chapter VIII.Louise Lucy Lockhart is an artist, poet, and author. She was born and bred in Montreal and attended the best primary, junior and high Schools. She read Philosophy, Politics. Economics and English literature at a renowned University on a scholarship, and is a frequent contributor to erudite social, economic, political journals, and top fashion magazines. She is well-traveled, speaks five languages, and lives her charmed, if not sophisticated life, attending concerts, plays, and cultured soirees. She is an accomplished cook and her culinary arts are the envy of many chefs. She is a liberated, free spirit, and with this novella ‘Theresa’ she adds an important comment to the new genre of feminist literature.",
