  "description": "Cooper MacKenzie lives for the job. At least he did before his marriage. But doing the occasional undercover job for his cousin and keeping it secret from his wife isn't settling well in his gut. Claire has come a long way from being a shy librarian, but she's no one's fool. She knows her husband is keeping something from her. Loving and trusting a man who serves and protects is harder than she realized.",
