Her handsome husband is due to return from his travels soon, and the temple and its people have recovered from the terrible war months before. Even though the evil has been banished from the land and all is calm, Shannon can t seem to shake the cloud of uneasiness (and nausea) she s been feeling, even after she receives the wonderful news of her forthcoming bundle of joy.But when a routine ride through the countryside turns dangerous, Shannon is once again pulled across the divide back to the rolling green of Oklahoma. Sensing the darkness growing in her former world and driven by Epona s steady hand, she must rely on the tempting and sexy Clint Freeman to help her defeat the all-too-familiar evil that lurks in the shadows before she can return to her real home Partholon.",
