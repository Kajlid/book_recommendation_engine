  "description": "Give your life away to change this world and God will change you…for the best.A rising voice in the missional movement, Palmer Chinchen challenges Christians to a new kind of spiritual formation—one focused on pouring out our life for others and radical dependence upon God.When we get out of our comfort zone, our souls are awakened—everything seems more alive and vibrant. So why don’t we live our faith that way? Why is it that our faith can easily become an old, tired routine instead of an exhilarating, God-honoring lifestyle? Discover why true religion involves engaging the problems in our world as we go with the good news of the gospel. And in the process of pouring ourselves out for others, we’ll see God radically transform our own hearts as well.",
