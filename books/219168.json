  "description": "I’m not crazy.It’s not amnesia.But I somehow lost a year of my life.When the cops and doctors think you’re out of your mind, but you still need answers, where else is there to turn but a private investigator?Sawyer is nothing you’d want in a friend- a little detached, cool, sarcastic, cocksure. But he’s everything you’d want in a private investigator- calm, capable, experienced, and just jaded enough by the darkness he’d seen to take a chance on some random girl who insists something more sinister must have happened to her than simple memory loss.But thrown together, trying to get to the root of my mystery, feelings that were most definitely  not  client/professional start to emerge.(( Link for possible triggers to post here closer to the release ))",
