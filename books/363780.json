  "description": "Six months after the alien Kreelan Empire launched its invasion of human space, the Confederation of Humanity, a coalition of human worlds banding together for self defense, is rapidly growing.Unfortunately, not all human worlds want to join the Confederation. Some, like Saint Petersburg, don't believe the tales of alien invaders, and think that the formation of the Confederation is nothing more than a veil over Earth's expansionist ambitions. With a powerful navy built in secret and armed with nuclear weapons, Saint Petersburg is preparing to launch their own offensive against Earth before the Confederation becomes too powerful.The Confederation heavy cruiser Yura, commanded by Ichiro Sato, is part of the fleet the Confederation sends to preempt Saint Petersburg's attack. Drawn into a deadly trap, the Confederation fleet and its Marines are fighting for their lives when Kreelan warships, led by the enigmatic warrior priestess Tesh-Dar, materialize out of hyperspace.As Tesh-Dar and her warriors wreak havoc on the two human fleets and Saint Petersburg itself, Ichiro, Roland Mills, and a Confederation spy known as SCARLET are faced with desperate choices from which they learn the true meaning of sacrifice.The IN HER NAME THE LAST WAR Trilogy- First Contact (Book 1)- Legend Of The Sword (Book 2)- Dead Soul (Book 3)REDEMPTION Trilogy- Empire (Book 1)- Confederation (Book 2)- Final Battle (Book 3)THE FIRST EMPRESS Trilogy- From Chaos Born (Book 1)- Forged In Flame (2013)- Mistress Of The Ages (2013)HARVEST Trilogy- Season Of The Harvest (Book 1)- Bitter Harvest (Book 2, June 2012)- Reaping The Harvest (2013)",
