  "description": "Beautiful, successful, and plus-sized El suffered a violent attack that has left her hating all handsome, wealthy men. Unfortunately for Stefan, he’s exactly what she hates.  Stefan is a playboy to the extreme with one hard and fast rule: date a woman once, take her to bed, and be gone before morning. Until El. When he is the winning bidder at his brother Simon’s charity auction, he thinks his dream of finding his one true mate has come true. Wrong. So very very wrong. It’ll require drastic measures by the entire Le Beau family to make this mating happen. Welcome to New Orleans, Louisiana, where every myth and scary story you were ever told is real. A place where the things that go bump in the night, or daytime for that matter, are surprisingly friendly. For the most part. Take a good look at your neighbor, the person sitting beside you at the bar, or your coworker. Are you sure they’re human?Le Beau SeriesBook 1 CADEBook 2 SIMONBook 3 SIMON & ROSEBook 4 STEFANBook 5 THOMASBook 6 CADE & ANNABook 7 LUCASBook 8 RICHIE Book 9 SETH",
