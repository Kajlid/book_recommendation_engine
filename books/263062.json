  "description": "From the author of Walks With Him Comanche Bride, The Flight of Falcons Nez Perce Bride, comes the final saga in this best selling Native Bride Series. Raised by an infamous gunslinger, Christine River learns to survive the Arizona territory living like a man. In fact, she prefers it until the day she finds an orphaned Apache baby under a tree. She's determined to take the child home and raise him as her own until she's ambushed on the trail by a fierce looking warrior claiming she stole his son! Not one to back down from a fight, Christine isn't giving up and he's not giving in. Together, they expose a frightening truth about the recent massacres and missing children in the area, and the heartbreak about Christine's, \"Broken Butterfly's\" own turbulent past. She might enjoy the freedom of living like a man, but Thomas Shadow Wolf is going to prove that she has much more power as a woman. Each novella is a stand alone and can be read in any order. This a novella has slighlty less pages then the other previous stories in the series. It is also more graphic with language, violence and sexual situations. Not for the under 18 reader. Be sure to read the Author's note at the end. Thank you for taking this extrordinary journey with me. Elle Marlow",
