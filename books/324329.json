  "title": "Tales from a Dog Catcher",
  "description": "Tales from a Dog Catcher is based on the author's experiences in a smallish city in the northern suburbs of NYC. Reminiscent of both All Creatures Great and Small and Marley & Me, it offers the stories of everyday people who, whether by accident or design, come into contact with the sad, funny, and often profound world of an animal control officer. It both entertains and charms, and is funny, touching, and heart-breaking by turns. These are real-life stories about people and their experiences with animals.",
