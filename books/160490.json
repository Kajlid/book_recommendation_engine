  "description": "LOVE SCARS BURN, SEDUCE, AND NEVER, EVER FADE...ANNAThe worst night of my life just got worse. Nobody explained why I've been dumped in this run down house, or who this hulk with the filthy mouth is. All I know is he wants me, he says I'm his, and I'm ignoring my instinct to run like hell.When he pulls me into his embrace, I want to push closer to his warmth, his strength, his vicious tattoos.Can I trust him? Can I trust myself? Or will obeying his wicked words confirm all my worst suspicions?DAVIDSo sweet, so pure, so confused...I almost feel bad about claiming her. Almost.Too bad she's a Rossini, and I don't regret making her old man sign her over to me for one second. I was born a Strelkov, a killer and an outlaw, and I second guess nothing.The instant my hands are on her, I know I've made the right choice. The crazy ache in my lips when they're not on hers doesn't lie. Revenge is a dish best served hot, sweaty, seething with passion, and Anna's tonight's special.Yeah, she's gonna flip when I shove the wedding contract in her face. But I'm gonna make her my wife in every nasty, beautiful, permanent way I can, even if it means adding a few more scars to my skin and Anna's heart...",
