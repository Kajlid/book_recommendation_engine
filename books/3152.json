  "description": "Burned out NY homicide detective, Rachel Chang is on a forced leave in Paris grieving over the loss of her partner, when she encounters a violent attack occurring outside the walls of Cimetiere du Montparnasse. What at first seems like a simple domestic turns into something far greater, when she attempts to stop the attacker and ends up on the wrong side of a set of very sharp fangs.A chase through the Parisian catacombs brings Rachel cheek to chest with sexy Gabriel Dumont, but his ‘pretty’ face hides more secrets than she can fathom. Secrets that can cost her more than the St. Michael medal her attacker took.Time is running out. Rachel needs answers. A killer is on the loose. One she's more attached to than she realizes. The trail leads back to the catacombs. All she has to do is follow the blood…AUTHOR Jordan has twenty-nine published books to her credit and has sold over 120,000 ebooks.
