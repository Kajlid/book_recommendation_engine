  "description": "A Contemporary Mystical Romance\n  What if I told you the greatest love stories ever told—Cleopatra and Mark Antony, Salim and Anarkali, Romeo and Juliet and so many more—are far greater tragedies than anyone has ever realized?  What if I told you that you haven’t been reading a new story… just a new chapter in one epic saga?  If I told you…all of those lovers…were actually the same two souls seeking their happily ever after over and over again, would you believe me?  Would you believe them? Born again, Love again, Part again, Was their curse.  In this modern era, will they find eternal love or will they be doomed to repeat the cycle forever?",
