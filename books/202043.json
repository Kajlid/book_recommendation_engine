  "description": "Stone Barrington is hired to protect a former intelligence agent with amnesia—and secrets worth killing for—in this heart-stopping thriller in the #1 'New York Times' bestselling series.Barton Cabot’s intelligence career is even more top secret than that of his brother, CIA senior exec Lance Cabot. But following a random act of violence, Barton is suffering from amnesia—a dangerous thing in a man whose memory is chock full of state secrets. So Lance hires Stone Barrington to watch his brother’s back.Stone soon discovers that his charge is a spy with a rather unusual hobby: building and restoring old and almost priceless American furniture. The genteel world of antiques and coin dealers seems a far cry from Stone’s usual underworld. But Barton is a man with a past, and one event in particular is coming back to haunt his present in ways Barton and Stone never expected...Librarian's note: the characters, settings and other information for the first 25 books in the series are complete as best possible (corrections are welcome!) for: #1, New York Dead, 1991; #2, Dirt, 1996; #3, Dead in the Water, 1997; #4, Swimming to Catalina, 1998; #5, Worst Fears Realized, 1999; #6, L.A.
