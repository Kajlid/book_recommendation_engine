And in the 21st century, all domestic robots are programmed according to that Law.But something had gone terribly wrong with Tik-Tok's \"asimov circuits\", and he sets out to injure as many people as possible - preferably fatally - while maintaining the exterior of a mild-mannered artist and a sincere campaigner for robot rights. So, like any self-respecting crook and murderer, he moves into politics, becoming the first robot candidate for Vice-President of the United States.Tik-Tok follows his maniacal progress from humble beginnings to the top of the heap - or almost.
