  "description": "Adair is a young journalist haunted by a conspiracy that sent his father Doctor Brown running to the safety of a remote Scottish Island, when he was still a child. Was his father deluded? Perhaps even insane or was he telling the truth? Sophia was Adairâ€™s childhood friend. At the age of eleven, they became separated only to meet years later through the internet. However, they are soon overcome by dark events and the distortions of their everyday lives. Shadows creep, and menacing events take place as they seek to unravel the terrible secrets that are being kept from humanity.",
