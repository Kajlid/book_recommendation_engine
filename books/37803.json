  "title": "Brooklyn Zoo: The Education of a Psychotherapist",
  "description": "Ever wonder just who that person in the chair opposite you in the therapist's office is, and how he or she got that way? Wonder no more. This is a compelling memoir about the stressful, yet never less than exciting, education of a psychotherapist in the midst of institutional dysfunction that bids fair to become to psychotherapy what Scott Turow's One L is to lawyering and Samuel Shem's House of God is to doctoring.",
