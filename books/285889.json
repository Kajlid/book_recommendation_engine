  "description": "\"Must be judged as a landmark in medical sociology.\"—Norman Denzin, Journal of Health and Social Behavior\"Profession of Medicine is a challenging monograph; the ideas presented are stimulating and thought provoking. . . . Given the expanding domain of what illness is and the contentions of physicians about their rights as professionals, Freidson wonders aloud whether expertise is becoming a mask for privilege and power. . . . Profession of Medicine is a landmark in the sociological analysis of the professions in modern society.\"—Ron Miller, Sociological Quarterly\"This is the first book that I know of to go to the root of the matter by laying open to view the fundamental nature of the professional claim, and the structure of professional institutions.\"—Everett C. Hughes, Science",
