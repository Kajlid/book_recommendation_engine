  "description": "The best kisses are the ones kept a secret. Billionaire business guru Charles is a love ‘em and leave ‘em kind of guy. That’s certainly no secret. Unlike the affair he’s about to engage in with August who is half his age. A younger man he really has no business calling Sir. Auggie is only supposed to be pet-sitting for his father and step-dad while they are on their honeymoon. Not kissing Charles and making him laugh. Not buying his favorite food and taking him out on dates. One night is what they agreed on. A secret shared between only their lips as Charles discovers he’s not so straight. But maybe one night can become two...and even more...After all, anything’s possible as long as they don’t get caught.This is the first book in the \nSecrets & Scandal\n duology featuring two men whose affairs must be kept secret to avoid a scandal. Part 2, Scandal will be out shortly. Both books must be read together.Secrets & Scandal features supporting characters from the Taking Caring trilogy but can be read on its own.",
