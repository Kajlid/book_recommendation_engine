  "description": "THE PERFECT GIFT FOR CHRISTMAS AND ALL THE HOLIDAYSWhen Sally Wolf shows Professor Walter Reeves a journal an ancestor found after the Battle of the Little Big Horn, all hell breaks loose. The secrets revealed about General George Armstrong Custer startle Walter.Among other things, if the writer is to be believed, Custer conspired with mining magnates and renegade Indians to launch a gambling casino in the Black Hills. It would be a place which “indjuns could help run,” where “white men cud play at cards,” and weary travelers could “enjoy a show with indjuns and others pretendin to” fight.Walter realizes his promotion will be assured if the journal is authentic and published.Before he can determine authenticity, Sally is kidnapped, and Walter is pursued by Native American activists and a pro-Custer militia organization. Neither group wants the journal made public.This inventive, humorous, and unpredictable romp culminates near the Little Big Horn National Battleground on the anniversary of Custer’s Last Stand, as Walter, the Indians, and the militia collide.",
