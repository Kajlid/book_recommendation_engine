  "description": "Is love enough to forsake power exchange?Roman and Jeff are building a new life in Minnesota, even though Jeff's been insisting since the accident that he just wants to be vanilla. A funny thing, though, Jeff's BDSM erotic fiction is quickly becoming the latest Amazon Indie success story, which makes Roman wonderâ€¦ if Jeff is still kinky in his head, what about his heart? The local fetish community is a lot different in this town than in the club Roman created in New York City. Roman admits that he's a fetish snob, but still, an inexperienced local boy has managed to capture and keep his interest. Roman is determined to integrate his own controlling tendencies, Jeff's imagination, and Jason's submission into something that feels like home.70,000 words, Gay erotic fiction, BDSM, M/M, and soft M/M/F",
