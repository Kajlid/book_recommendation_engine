  "description": "(Alternate cover edition of ASIN B00HERC33E.) This bad boy is ready to work some magic... Identical twin and Las Vegas performer Max Dalton has always been the number one bad boy in his family, and he's appreciated the women and fame that comes along with his reputation. Now, with his brother married to the love of his life and expecting a family of his own, Max sees what being a playboy has cost him. Grace Sinclair is on a mission when she comes to Vegas, one that involves asking Max, her best friend's brother-in-law, to give her the pleasure no man's ever been able to. She suspects Max has more layers than he lets people see, but she's determined to keep her heart safe even as she offers him her body. After all, Max can give her what she wants, but not what she needs--her own family. For that, she has a plan that doesn't include Max. Will Grace see beyond Max's bad boy fa√ßade long enough to trust him with her heart? And will Max figure out what he really wants before he loses the one woman who makes him believe in love again?",
