  "description": "One of Time Magazine's Best Books of the YearIn Landscape and Memory Schama ranges over continents and centuries to reveal the psychic claims that human beings have made on nature. He tells of the Nazi cult of the primeval German forest; the play of Christian and pagan myth in Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers; and the duel between a monumental sculptor and a feminist gadfly on the slopes of Mount Rushmore. The result is a triumphant work of history, naturalism, mythology, and art. \"A work of great ambition and enormous intellectual scope...consistently provocative and revealing.\"--New York Times\"Extraordinary...a summary cannot convey the riches of this book. It will absorb, instruct, and fascinate.\"--New York Review of Books",
