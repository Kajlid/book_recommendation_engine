  "description": "Will she choose control or just let go? When Madison Morris wanted to hire a shop assistant for her naughty little bookstore, she never dreamed she'd have two handsome men vying for the position―and a whole lot more. Does she choose dark and dangerous Andy with his sexy tattoos? Or quiet, serious Gabriel, whose lean physique and gentle touch tempt her more than she thought possible? She loves the way Andy takes charge when it comes to sex. But the turmoil in Gabe's eyes hints at a deep well of complicated emotions locked inside. When the fun and games are over, only one man can have control of her heart. \"If this is your first time crossing the line into the Dark Side of kinky sex and BDSM, then I recommend this book!\"―Night Owl Reviews, 5 stars, Reviewer Top Pick What readers are \"Forget Fifty Shades of Grey...take a look at this and see how long you can stay in control!\" \"This is honest to God, hands down, the best erotic fiction I've ever read.\" \"Highly addictive!\"",
