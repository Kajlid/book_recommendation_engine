  "description": "For rancher, Ezra James, life is pretty simple. He wakes before dawn and spends his day working with the cattle he loves. For twenty years, the EZ Does It ranch has been enough to drown out his loneliness and guilt. To the world, he appears impervious to everything. The only chink in his armour - the man who owns the clothing store in town.Palmer 'Wyn' Wynfield caught Ezra's eye the first time the rancher stepped foot in the store. Though Ezra knew his large size intimidated others, his little self-confidence was shattered when Palmer backed away in apparent fear. In a moment of self-preservation, he referred to Wyn as Mr. Fancy Pants. That was six years ago, and he's never been forgiven.An early morning phone call changes all that. Though the line is scratchy, Ezra definitely hears the words he's been waiting to hear for years. \"I need you.\"Reader Advisory: This book is best read in sequence as part of a series",
