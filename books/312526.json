  "description": "She wasn’t looking for love. Neither was he. Too bad fate had other plans for them… Cecelia Leary is ready for a fresh start. And starts don’t get any fresher than where she is right now—back in her childhood small town, jobless and newly single. She needs to take some time and figure out what to do with her life. She can not afford to be distracted by the sexy brewer who just offered her a job. But…she is… Liam Quinn works alone. Always. But if he wants to take his brewery to the next level, he needs Cecelia’s marketing expertise. Entertaining any stupid romantic notions about the curvy, wild-haired beauty would be a huge mistake. But…he does… Can Cecelia and Liam find a way to save the brewery—and fall in love while they’re at it? Maybe. But only if they can let go of their emotional baggage and learn to trust each other…Author’s Note: Trusting You is a full-length, standalone, steamy, light and funny contemporary read featuring a friends-to-lovers, slow burn romance with a panty-melting happily ever after. May also contain plenty of adult language, nautical beer puns, and seasonal decorative gourds. Download today and get ready to binge read.❤️",
