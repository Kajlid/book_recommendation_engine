  "description": "What happens in an exclusive alien sex club stays in an alien sex club, right?  Well... not when you pen an exposé on said alien sex club—carefully omitting the fact that the experiences detailed therein are yours rather than based on the firsthand accounts of nameless interviewees, as your article claims.  And not when the alien club owner you had the wildest night of your life with shows up bearing video footage of your most intimate moments together that refute this.  Amy has two choices: Be exposed as a fraud just as her journalism career is taking off, or agree to Vair’s wicked blackmail terms in exchange for his silence and protection from Krinar authorities.  For a young journalist on a mission to prove her worth, it was always about landing the next big story. Until it became all about playing sex games with a possessive extraterrestrial.  Vair: Beyond the X-Club is a short novel (45K words) set in the world created by Anna Zaires in her Krinar Chronicles, featuring characters introduced in her novelette/short story, \nThe X-Club.",
