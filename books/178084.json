After inviting her to his apartment for dinner, Rain learns Ethan and his roommate Cade are loving, caring, kind, and compassionate. When she is invited to stay the night and wait out a terrible storm, the changes she has been hoping for begin to unfold...But is she ready for what life is going to toss her way?\"I had always hoped one day love would call my name; and when it did, Iâ€™d be able to answer.
