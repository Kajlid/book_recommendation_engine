  "title": "Our Heritage Revisited : A glimpse into Ancient Indian texts",
  "description": "Ever wondered what is in the Veds and Upanishads? The terms Shruti, Smriti, Puran, Agam, Nigam, Advait, Vedant philosophy to name a few have been heard â€“ but what exactly are these? This book attempts to bring all of this and more in a quick-read for an overall perspective.We in India are blessed with a great literary heritage and tremendous cultural, philosophical and traditional wealth. However the contents of ancient Indian scriptures have generally remained an enigma and most of the existing works available to readers, take up for commentary, an individual text for a detailed understanding but an overall picture is not easily available.This book attempts to present a user-friendly description of these texts and their evolutionary account. It is a simple version, meant for someone keen to get an overview of our amazing ancient scriptures but may have found existing books too exhaustive.",
