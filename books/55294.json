  "description": "Thornton W. Burgess was a bird-watching, berry-picking student of nature, who took up writing children's stores including those collected in Old Mother West Wind \"Where\" Stories (1918). He writes about talking animals, but his characters remain true to their real-life counterparts. Each story explains how Old Mother Nature gives special attention to each creature's needs -- where Grandfather Frog got his big mouth, for example, and where Mr. Quack the duck got his webbed feet. Burgess sets his tales \"when the world was young,\" back when Peter Rabbit's \"great-great-ever-so-great grandfather\" was a young hopper, and Old Mother Nature still had some work to do on basic designs. She sees that a duck needs webbed feet to swim, and a prairie dog needs a burrow designed to keep dry. Burgess's animals are proud of their unique features and abilities, but the real voice of enthusiasm is the author's own, sharing the delights he found in the woods of New England. Typical of the book's charm is the story of where \"Dippy the loon got the name of being crazy.\" The bird is smarter than he looks -- and that's how Dippy always gets the last laugh.",
