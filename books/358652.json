  "description": "In this new Romney Marsh story Tamzin, Rissa, Meryon and Roger suddenly realise that they are growing up into the adult world. In particular, something that is stronger than friendship develops between Tamzin and Meryonâ€”a fact which at first makes Rissa lament the break up of their old four-cornered alliance. This theme, which is handled with great sympathy by the author, provides the background for another exciting adventure in true Romney Marsh tradition. Once again the four young people discover that Jim Decks, that hoary old rogue of a fisherman, is up to no good, and in spite of themselves they are drawn into his nefarious affairs An ex-hearse, a midnight fishing trip and a lifeboat rescue all play a part in one of the best stories this author has written.",
