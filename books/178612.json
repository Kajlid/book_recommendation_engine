  "description": "When a harebrained scheme to swipe forty pounds of pot from Russian mobsters goes awry, the Wizard thinks he's got problems. But when a giant evil talking dog shows up and starts raising the dead, things get a little more complicated. As the end grows nigh, it's up to Wiz and his ragtag cohorts (along with a binge-drinking voodoo god) to fend off the hungry horde. Will they make it? Or will everything go up in smoke? A hilarious, gut-busting, skull-crunching homage to B-movies everywhere. Funnier than The Illyad... Scarier than Brokeback Mountain... Dumber than Breakfast of Champions... Significantly shorter than Dune... It's Zen and the Art of Cannibalism.",
