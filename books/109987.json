  "description": "For the 75th anniversary of Anne Frank's birth, an important publishing event -- the first full-colour visual book celebrating the legacy of Anne and her famous house Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl has been read by millions around the world and many of them have, since the house was opened as a museum in 1960, travelled to Amsterdam to see the building and the hiding place where Anne Frank wrote her diary. Visitors to 263 Prinsengracht are taken on a journey back in time; in each of the rooms, excerpts from Anne's diary provide an impression of what happened there during the hiding period - and visitors can trace the lives of each of the inhabitants of the Secret Annex and the four employees of Anne's father. This magnificent and heartbreaking volume takes readers on the same journey, following the same route that visitors make on the physical tour. The same excerpts from the diary that appear in the house - with the addition of background information by the museum directors and designers, the words of Anne's father, and comments from some of the people who have been affected by Anne's words, and a comprehensive history of the publication of the diary.This essential photographic document is a thorough, disturbing, and crucial part of the testament to faith and humanity that continues to live on as Anne Frank's legacy.",
