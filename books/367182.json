  "description": "STOP.\n\nYou should not have touched this book with your bare hands.\nNO, don’t put it down. It’s too late. \nThey’re watching you.\nMy name is David Wong. My best friend is John. Those names are fake. You might want to change yours.\nYou may not want to know about the things you’ll read on these pages, about the sauce, about Korrok, about the invasion, and the future. But it’s too late. You touched the book. You’re in the game. You’re under the eye.\nThe only defense is knowledge. You need to read this book, to the end. Even the part with the bratwurst. Why? You just have to trust me.\n \n\nThe important thing is this:\n\nThe drug is called Soy Sauce and it gives users a window into another dimension.  \nJohn and I never had the chance to say no.  \nYou still do.\nUnfortunately for us, if you make the right choice, we’ll have a much harder time explaining how to fight off the otherworldly invasion currently threatening to enslave humanity.\n            I’m sorry to have involved you in this, I really am. But as you read about these terrible events and the very dark epoch the world is about to enter as a result, it is crucial you keep one thing in mind: \n \n\n\nNone of this is was my fault.",
