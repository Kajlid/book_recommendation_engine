  "description": "Impending global ecological collapse begs the Are humans a planetary disease? Dr. Lucille Boggs, a maverick scientist at a large western university, had been uncovering surprising answers as to why humans remain indifferent to the looming ecological collapse that jeopardizes the world today. Yet her untimely death in 1999 threatened to put an end to her extraordinary discoveries. Through an ingenious manipulation involving her Last Will and Testament, however, she managed to goad a nephew into following a mysterious trail she had so nearly completed -- a journey that takes him and his wife to remote territories, and ultimately, leads them back to the truths they hold inside. Entertaining and informational, Balance Point is a timely book with cutting-edge relevance. It is recommended for anyone concerned about the state of the Earth, as well as for the environmentally complacent. In Balance Searching for a Spiritual Missing Link, Joseph Jenkins examines the global implications of a society on the brink of both planetary destruction and spiritual revolution, weaving scientific facts within a tapestry of mystery and adventure to reveal remarkable spiritual concepts. Rich with a non-religious mysticism reminiscent of Carlos Castaneda, it draws from the astute observations of some of the world's leading ecological visionaries like David Suzuki and Paul Hawken. Balance Point is a singular work that imparts a disturbing, yet hopeful awareness of the world around us and the universe within us, revealing what may be the route to our planet's, and our species', long term survival.",
