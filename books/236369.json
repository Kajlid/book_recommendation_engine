On his way he comes across some obstacles and he makes friends along the way who end up helping him with those obstacles. These new friends also attend the show. His first obstacle was a group of palm trees that moved to block his way. Uniqua the Tree Charmer plays his flute to which the palm trees begin to sway and move out of the way. Second obstacle was a sandstorm that swept them up into the air but luckily Pablo, Master of Storms was nearby. He used his staff and an old family secret to stop the storm. Third obstacle was an old rickety bridge and because of the storm they're running late for the talent show. In order to make it in time they must cross the bridge. While crossing, the ropes break and the boards fall from underneath them. As they're falling Austin, Carpet Pilot, first class saves them with his magic carpet. Carpet Pilot Austin ends up giving them a ride to the Oasis. The four travelers arrive just as the last performer leaves the stage and the host Tasha is about to announce the winner. Tyrone yells, \"Wait! Wait!\" and they're given an opportunity to explain what happened to them on their journey to the show. Host Tasha wants to hear it! Tyrone and his four new friends tell the story of their adventure. Host Tasha thinks it's the most exciting story she's ever heard so they won first prize.",
