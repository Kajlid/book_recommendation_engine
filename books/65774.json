Gabe, Clara, and their clan must leave the relative safety of Beau Chêne, Louisiana, in order to train with others gathering in the north. No one knows what lurks when night falls. While Gabe grows in confidence, Clara begins to doubt everything, including her feelings for Gabe. Looming between them is a growing chasm. When a new clansmen Michael arrives, he's all too willing to take Gabe’s place as her confidant and more. Clara finds his charms difficult to resist. She wonders why she should resist at all.Beyond Clara’s battle to save a lost loved one seeking her help from the shadows and to keep Gabe close to her heart, another threat stirs, whispering to Clara in the dark. Something evil hunts her. Will she listen to the one who calls to her in nightmares and eventually finds her in the flesh? Will she succumb to his will or will she cling to her human soul and her human heart?",
