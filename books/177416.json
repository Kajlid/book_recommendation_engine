  "description": "THE RUDE, CRUDE AND OUTRAGEOUSLY FUNNY PREGNANCY BOOK FOR MEN!Most Pregnancy for Men books seem to just regurgitate the same information contained in the pregnancy guides forwomen – with a few references to football and beer thrown in to make them seem a bit more ‘manly’.The Modern Caveman’s ‘Alternative’ Guide to Pregnancy, however, is NOT one of those!If you really want to know what size the foetus is at week 7 or what features to look for when buying a cot,then have a read of your partner's pregnancy books or look it up on the internet!If, however, you would rather have far more practical information •how to maintain an active sex life despite your partner throwing up around the clock,•how to make a customised sick-bowl that will both make your partner feel better and also help you to be much more supportive,•how to reduce any housework you may have to do to the bare minimum,•how to spot the early signs of labour,•the one sign which if you do spot it probably means you need urgent psychiatric help, and•how to keep yourself entertained through the long, boring hours of labour, with great games such as 'Swearword Bingo'then this ‘Alternative’ pregnancy book for men is quite possibly just what the doctor ordered – assuming the doctor is a foul-mouthed misogynist.",
