  "description": "Faline SavageKnox Prud’homme was like a fish out of water when he sat amongst the big, burly men in my club. He was scrawny, shy and tolerated their taunting and bullying. Knox never complains, but I see it in his eyes, it is a cry for help. I suppose it comes in handy that I am a mad scientist, as well, and this man is in serious need of my help...so long as he accepts my offer.Knox Prud’hommeDamn, I feel like an idiot for joining a motorcycle club because of a woman. Though Faline Savage is gorgeous from head to toe-she’s got a good heart and she’s smart as fuck. I thought I was being a creeper staring at her all the damn time. I thought she saw right through me until she made me an offer that would change my life. If I could have this woman in my life, then there is no way in hell I am going to look a gift horse in the mouth.",
