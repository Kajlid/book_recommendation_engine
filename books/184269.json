With their memories erased, they’ve all been transformed—some for better, some for worse.Seventeen-year-old Cardinal Cassidy has escaped the virus, but he can’t escape its devastating impact on his home and family. He chooses to remain deep within the Quarantine Zone, living in a mountain camp with the town’s former bully—now his best friend. Together, they look after a group of orphaned kids and do their best to move on.But then an enigmatic young woman appears, a private corporation takes control of Black River, and the safe, closed-off world Cardinal has created begins to crumble.",
