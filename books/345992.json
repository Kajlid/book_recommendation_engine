  "title": "How to Be a Movie Star: Elizabeth Taylor in Hollywood",
  "description": "Elizabeth Taylor has never been short on star power, but in this unprecedented biography, the spotlight is entirely on herâ a spirited beauty full of magic, professional daring, and wit. Â Acclaimed biographer William Mann follows Elizabeth Taylor publicly as she makes her ascent at MGM, falls into (and out of) marriages, wins Oscars, fights studio feuds, and combats America's conservative values with her decidedly modern love affairs. But he also shines a light on Elizabeth's rich private life, revealing a love for her craft and a loyalty to the underdog that fueled her lifelong battle against the studio system. Swathed in mink, disposing of husbands but keeping the diamondsâ this is Elizabeth Taylor as she lived and loved, breaking and making the rules in the game of supreme celebrity.",
