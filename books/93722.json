  "description": "Nicole \"Nyx\" Green, notorious for her red lipstick and over-the-top personality, has just snagged the man of her dreams–the brooding Crashbang bassist AJ Abbott. Well, he was the man of her dreams. Now that they’re together, Nyx is realizing that he’s way too obsessed with his music to even think about having a girlfriend.AJ’s obsession pays off when the band meets with record executives in New York City, and Nyx meets her half-brother Jeremy. Reuniting with long lost family is complicated enough (especially a long lost family who are tabloid staples), but Nyx never expected to meet Tristan.See, Jeremy happens to be best friends with the gorgeous, arrogant Tristan Halifax, an A-Lister with a penchant for beautiful women. Nyx and Tristan might experience love at first sight, but rock star ex-boyfriends are hard to forget—especially when they keep writing chart topping love songs dedicated to her red lipstick.Overnight, Nyx becomes America’s Sweetheart—scandalizing parties, frolicking with Manhattan’s Golden Boys, and being hounded by photographers. Sure, it’s fun, but then the press starts turning nasty—jeopardizing her relationship with Tristan, ruining her reputation, and discovering her old skeletons. Plus, there’s AJ, who’s suddenly morphed into a great guy, and now is fighting to reignite their high school romance.Celebrities are supposed to have it all, right? Money. Looks. Love. But suddenly, a downward spiral doesn’t seem all that unrealistic, and Nyx will have to decide what’s more important–her new infamous lifestyle or her familiar small-town roots.",
