  "description": "Everyman is a medieval morality play that was first performed in the late 15th century. The play tells the story of Everyman, a wealthy and successful man who is suddenly called upon by Death to make a reckoning of his life. Everyman is forced to confront the fact that he has lived a life of sin and must now face judgment for his actions. Along the way, he is abandoned by many of his friends and family members, who are unwilling to accompany him on his journey to the afterlife. Everyman eventually turns to Good Deeds, who agrees to accompany him to the final judgment. The play is a powerful allegory for the Christian belief in the importance of leading a virtuous life and preparing for the afterlife. It is also a poignant reminder of the inevitability of death and the need to live each day with purpose and meaning.Everyman. Gramercy, my frendes and kynnesmen kynde.
