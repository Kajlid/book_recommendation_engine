  "title": "Petra's Getaway",
  "description": "This story is a little unusual. It is a side story that takes place during the Christmas holidays of the book called “James Potter and the Curse of the Gatekeeper”, which is sequel to “James Potter and the Hall of Elders’ Crossing”. If you have not yet read those books, this tale will contain a rather large and important “spoiler”, and furthermore, may not make as much sense as you’d hope. Therefore, may I be so bold as to suggest you take a look at the aforementioned stories before reading any further? If you enjoyed Ms. Rowling’s Harry Potter stories (and why would you be here if you had not?) then there is a fair chance you will like these stories as well. Then, do come back and view “Petra’s Getaway”. It will make a lot more sense, and you’ll feel quite proud of yourself for heeding this advice.If, on the other hand, you have already read the aforementioned stories and know Petra’s tale thus far, then I do hope you enjoy this extra glimpse into her life.",
