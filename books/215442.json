  "title": "Paston Letters and Papers of the Fifteenth Century: Part I",
  "description": "The Paston family papers have long been consulted for their information about social history and politics, both within East Anglia and also nationally, in the fifteenth century. Part I of this edition was first published by the Clarendon Press in 1971 (Part II in 1976), but the edition has long been out of print. In addition to the letters and papers, Part I contains biographical sketches of the writers, a full comparative chronological table and the Introduction. The opportunity has been taken in this re-issue to correct minor typographical and editorial errors, but Professor Davis's work has not been otherwise altered. Part III, edited by Dr Richard Beadle and Professor Colin Richmond, is due to be published in 2005, and will contain the remaining text, and indices. It will complete the series. Norman Davis was formerly Merton Professor of English Language and Literature at the University of Oxford, and Director of the Early English Text Society.",
