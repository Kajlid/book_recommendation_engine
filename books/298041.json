  "description": "GrimI screwed up, and boy did I screw up in a big way. I always tell people not to go for a ride when they’re pissed. Combine the anger with the slick roads and heavy rain. That’s what landed me in the hospital. Though, I was lucky. They told me the only thing I’d need to do is go for a few weeks of physical therapy and adjustments with a chiropractor. That’s where I met Natalie Benet. She was the friendly face in the front. The one who chats with all the patients, gets to know them, and makes them feel as comfortable as they can even in their most painful moments. While her encouraging words pissed me off at first, I learned to appreciate her support. She was just a woman who showed me kindness. Maybe even more than I deserved. I was out with Axel one night at a bar in town and heard this asshole chatting with his buddies, talking about his bitch of a wife. It didn’t take me long until he said her name along with a few other details that confirmed it was the Natalie I see every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. He joked about beating her up like a rat dog again. He laughed with his buddies about turning her face black and blue to the point she wouldn’t be able to work for a week. One thing’s for certain-- he’ll scream for mercy when I tear every tooth out of his fuckin’ mouth for layin’ a hand on her.",
