  "description": "Although Mum is naturally reticent about personal difficulties, and also worried that people might see her as a silly old thing, losing her marbles, she was drawn to the idea of going public if it would decrease the stigma of the disease and help others. She just wasn't convinced it really would do any good. It's that terminal modesty again! We told her we were sure it would be helpful. She listened to us, thought about it and finally said, I think you're probably overrating the difference I could make, but if you really think it could be useful then yes, bugger it, I'll do it.In November 2003 Hazel Hawke went public with the news that she had Alzheimer's Disease. The result was a national outpouring of concern, affection and appreciation on a scale rarely seen. The Australian newspaper described her action in an editorial as an act of personal courage that has touched the hearts of millions. Now Hazel's daughter Sue tells the full story of her mother's life in the past 10 years: stepping out as her own woman after her split with former PM Bob Hawke, the early signs of what would prove to be Alzheimer's, Hazel's fear and anger, her decision to go public, and the gentle happiness in her life now.Unflinchingly honest and incredibly poignant, Hazel's Journey will touch all readers and offer comfort and insight to others affected by the disease. It will also raise money for the Hazel Hawke Alzheimer's Research & Care Fund.",
