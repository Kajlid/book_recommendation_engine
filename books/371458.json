  "description": "Be small. Be invisible. It’s an odd life mantra for a fragile human woman in a world of monsters. But Jane’s blood contains a touch of vampire magic, which makes her a target. With her faster-than-normal healing time, she’s an ideal punching bag for the abusive vampire she’s been living with, the one she thought might protect her this time.Paul owes a debt to the werewolf alpha, and Cole doesn’t care how he gets flesh or coin. $10,000 or Jane? The human is a small price to pay to be debt-free.Cole is attractive and warm---so different from the coldness and death Jane has grown used to. If the werewolves didn’t have a worse reputation than the vampires, being taken by the alpha might feel like rescue, but Cole’s growing possessive nature, makes Jane fear he’ll only abuse her like the others. If he doesn’t, could becoming an alpha’s mate free her from the vampires for good?Blood Lust (book 1) (Kept, Claimed, Mated)Save My Soul (book 2)The Catalyst (book 3)Life Cycle (book 4)Cat FightDark Mercy (prelude to Hadrian and Angeline's book... the upcoming book 5)",
