  "description": "Twelve-year-old Ethan Parker and his friends attend Justice Academy, a middle school just for kids with superpowers. The entire school is buzzing about the upcoming Sidekick Tryouts, a brand new competition where the Nexus Guardians—the city’s elite team of crime fighting superheroes—will choose their newest batch of recruits. But a week before the tryouts begin, mysterious circumstances lure the famed Guardians out of the city and a new threat emerges. A villainous man calling himself the Hero Smasher declares war on all supers, taking Nexus City hostage with his mind control abilities and an army of mechanical minions. With the Guardians out of the picture and time quickly running out, it’s up to a group of super-powered sixth graders to rise up and find the courage within to take on a super villain before their city is lost forever.",
