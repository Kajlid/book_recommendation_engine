  "description": "Disclaimer: This series is a continuation of my Watcher series of books. You need to have read the following series (in this order) to understand what is happening in this story: The Watchers Trilogy, The Watcher Chronicles, and Caylin's Story. Please be advised that this series will contain sexual situations of a mature nature. If I were to rate this series like a movie, I would rate it 'R'.On the night Anna was born, she was promptly sent away from the down-world to live in the cloud city of Cirrus. That very same night her future was decided for her when she became betrothed to Crown Prince Augustus Amador. For twenty-one years, she has lived as Lady Anna, future Empress of Cirrus and proud daughter of Andre Greco. Although Anna's destiny seemed laid out for her, fate intervenes to reveal the true path she was always meant to take. With the unexpected arrival of Malcolm Devereaux into her world, Anna knows without a shadow of a doubt that she has finally been reunited with the missing piece of her soul. Chaos and turmoil soon turn Anna's once docile life upside down, but she knows with Malcolm by her side she can accomplish the mission she was born to undertake. Not only must Anna fight against the princes of Hell, but she must also find a way to help Malcolm stop living in the past so they can have a chance at a future.",
