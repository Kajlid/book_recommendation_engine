  "description": "The Torch and the Sword continues the message that began in the Final Quest and continued in The Call. It is a call to live the greatest adventure for the most noble purpose. It is not for the faint of heart, but for those who desire to live as true knights of the cross, refusing to retreat before the great darkness of our time. It is for those who will stand with courage and resolution for truth, righteousness, and justice as messengers of the age to come. These are the ones whom Enoch prophesied would come with power in the last days who are now awakening to their destiny.",
