Clouds and rain are nowhere to be found, and even the darkness of night brings little relief from the strange and oppressive day.Meanwhile, those who commune regularly with their gods are uneasy. Every day, their deities become more distant, more difficult to reach. Clerics' prayers go unanswered, and magic goes awry. As the tension on Ansalon builds, estranged cousins Palin Majere and Steel Brightblade search for an explanation. It soon becomes evident that more than just magic is at stake.The fate of all Krynn hangs in the balance.",
