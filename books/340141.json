  "description": "Had the old hag made a mistake? This couldn't be what Amelia was supposed to meet here, could it? Why would she send Amelia to fight such a - whatever it was - without warning her first? Amelia didn't have time to worry any longer as the creature took another giant step forward, looming closer and lowering its huge head towards her, revealing its bright white eyes, sitting in slits in the skull.

Hidden in the amethyst is the second book in the Amelia Maylock series.",
