  "description": "Rambles into Sacred Realms is the beautiful and inspiring chronicle of author and artist Krish V. Krishnan's travels around the globe as he explores and portrays places of awe-inspiring divinity through writing and artwork. Krish recounts his experiences at places like the stunning rocky red desert of Petra, Jordan, replete with the ruins of shrines, palaces, and tombs; the ancient and holy city of Varanasi, India, where sacred chants waft in the breeze as funeral pyres consume the dead; and the ruins of Sukhothai, Thailand, teeming with temples, monuments, shrines, and watchful statues of Buddha as far as the eye can see. Krish's writings offer adventure, drama, and bits of humor, and his extensive collection of artwork, in watercolor, scratchboard, acrylics, pencil, and pastel, is superbly executed and captivatingly impassioned. Rambles into Sacred Realms offers a compelling invitation to the reader to vicariously enjoy and experience, through both words and images, the stunning power of some of the world's most incredible and sacred places.",
