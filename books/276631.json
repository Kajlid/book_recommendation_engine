  "description": "As the Earth continues to rebuild from Mars’ missile strike, and society roils in the wake of the hormonal suppressant shortage, Azure Lynwood is facing an even worse piece of news: the Space Corps have found out about Tor’s reckless plan to help dozens of omegas get through their heats, and he’s been arrested.  But Tor assures Azure that help is on the way. He’s friends with a brilliant lawyer who specialises in alpha and omega cases, and it will only be a matter of time before the charges against him are swept under the proverbial rug. The news is heartening… until Azure finds out that Tor’s flashy new lawyer is none other than Ethan McCallum, the omega who first taught Tor how to go through a heat, all those years ago.  Note: It is recommended that you read Hurricane and Deluge (The Elements Books 1 & 2) before Lava.",
