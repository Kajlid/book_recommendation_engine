And a third. And a fourth… Caught in a loop, condemned to experience the same 24 hours over and over, Spence tries to prevent the terrible events of the party.To break the spell he has to re-evaluate everything he previously took for granted and find the courage to call out his own and others complicity in events that marked the life and death of Clara Hart.",
