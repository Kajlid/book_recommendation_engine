  "title": "Character Disturbance: The Phenomenon of Our Age",
  "description": "Modern permissiveness and the new culture of entitlement allows disturbed people to reach adulthood without proper socialization. In a book meant both for the general public and for professionals, bestselling author and psychologist George Simon explains in plain English:•How most disturbed characters think. •The habitual behaviors the disturbed use to avoid responsibility and to manipulate, deceive, and exploit others. •Why victims in relationships with disturbed characters do not get help they need from traditional therapies. •A straightforward guide to recognizing and understanding all relevant personality types, especially those most likely to undermine relationships. •A new framework for making sense of the crazy world many find themselves in when there's a disturbed character in their lives. •Concrete principles that promote responsibility and positive change when engaging disturbed characters. •Tactics (for both lay persons and therapists) to lessen the chances for victimization and empower those who would otherwise be victims in their relationships with many types of disturbed characters.",
