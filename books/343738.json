  "description": "The first appearances of Rufferto, Groo's loyal dog, are available for the first time in over ten years! When the palace dog runs away to seek adventure, he encounters -- and becomes enamored with -- the world's least intelligent barbarian, Groo! Rufferto thinks he has found a companion for life, but Groo just thinks he's found dinner. And when a reward is offered for Rufferto, our heroes become hunted by, well, just about everyone. What's a dumb wanderer and an only slightly smarter dog to do?",
