As Lowair recovers from the Blue Plague and civil war looms on the horizon, the twins struggle to navigate the opposing forces of the crown princess, the queen, and her most powerful minister. They find a brief respite in the house of their estranged uncle and the collection of rogue mages living there, but it quickly becomes apparent that the house is hiding as many secrets as Court.But Court never rests. As the crown princess, queen, and minister fight for their version of Lowair's future, it becomes impossible to determine who is in the right. Nevertheless, further visions force Pyri and Rohin to pick a side. But with the magecraft illness striking unexpectedly early and black and white becoming gray, they have underestimated what it will cost them.",
