  "description": "Is not being happy really so bad? In HIGH ON LOW: HARNESSING THE POWER OF UNHAPPINESS, bestselling author Wilhelm Schmid persuasively argues that far from preventing us from living a full and successful life, being unhappy - be it in terms of discontent, melancholy, sadness, or depressive mood - is an inherent part of a well-rounded, active, and creative life. Rather than attempting to treat unhappiness as an unwelcome interloper on our perpetual quest for happiness, we should, Schmid suggests, draw on and harness the very power of not being happy.",
