  "description": "After losing a member of their own, Cole’s pack struggles to reclaim their stability. But every step forward comes with two steps back, presenting new obstacles the pack must overcome. Standing in the backlash of Devan’s absence, Hayden feels isolated and helpless. She strives to establish her position as female Alpha, but each attempt backfires and sets her further apart from the others. Ironically, the one member she tries to avoid rebuffs her efforts and becomes her pillar of support. Cole won’t see her fall and continuously sets her back on her feet. She’ll need every source of strength available when the rogues finally unveil their plans. But not everything is what it seems, as one discovery only leads to more questions and more uncertainties.",
