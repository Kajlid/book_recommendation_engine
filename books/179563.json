  "description": "From the dark genius of wartime Nazi Germany, a secret strategy for world domination has come to the 21st century. A conspiracy too chilling to be believed . . . until it’s unleashed. The son of a hero who gave his life fighting this evil must now take up his father’s mission, and with his beautiful fellow agent meet the shadowy enemy – in the streets, in the frozen Arctic, and in the emptiness of space itself.",
