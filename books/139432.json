  "description": "Renée thought that her biggest problem was dealing with her divorced parents and graduating from High school. That was until she discovers her friends are more than they seem. It has Renée looking at everything differently. From awakening dreams to her feelings for Gage, everything is changing so fast. Secrets are being revealed, and danger grows closer with each day. Graduation is the last thing on her mind. The Unseelie Queen, who had killed her for the past few centuries repetitively, is after her again. This time armed with memories, friends, and the Seelie Fae court, would she be able to escape death? (The first of the Incarnate Triology.)",
