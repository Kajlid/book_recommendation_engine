The man who made me feel complete.And he was about to become my baby’s father.That was, if he decided to take a chance on us.Benjamin Walker was unexpected, and so were the changes he brought to my life. My focus should be on my new business, not the positive pregnancy test that came with the man stealing my heart.But we had more than caring for a baby to figure out.Between slaying dragons from his past, trying to close down the drug cartel that was haunting our small town, and fighting against his feelings for me and our baby, I wasn’t sure he was willing to take a chance on us.BENShe was the one woman who could save me from me.The one that turned my life on its axis and forced me to reevaluate what I thought I knew about love.But having a baby was never part of my plans.I was my father’s son, after all. A product of hate and viciousness.If you needed me to face a drug cartel, I was your man. If you needed me to despise the man who tried to eliminate me when I was a kid, you could count on me.I had yet to learn how to be the man Isabella Turner and our baby deserved, the man who knew how to take chances.Then I got cocky.Drunk on her love and acceptance, I took one too many chances and miscalculated the risks my past could bring to our doorstep.I thought I could gamble with life and come out unscathed.Newsflash: life won.",
