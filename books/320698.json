  "description": "The people of K'briadron lived an idyllic life. Purple and blue magic created by the Jockspurs supplied their every need. That is, until the coming of the Lockstick. Princess Kaylin Veronica and her cousin, Prince Theodore, escape the confines of their royal lives and set out to find the being who caused so many problems in their land. Written by the author of The Wishing Flower, The Magic of Laven-Rock is a delightful fairy tale adventure where children learn that sharing is much better than fighting, and that people throughout the world are not so very different than themselves.",
