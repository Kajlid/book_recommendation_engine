  "description": "The true-life story of an imagined Utopia – of willpower, sacrifice and joy, and of daring to dream. Imagine you’re working in a brick factory in the Argentine city Mar del Plata, and a 22-year-old colleague tells you he’s going to quit his job to become a professional footballer in Europe. Yeah, right. Next, he blows his savings on a ticket to England, travelling with just 300 dollars in his pocket. He doesn’t speak English, has no one to stay with and no work. Time passes. You forget about the kid. Until, three years later, you turn on the TV and he’s playing against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge – mixing it against the likes of Ballack and Drogba.

The incredible journey of Crawley Town playmaker Sergio Torres shows that reality can be stranger than fantasy. And you haven’t heard half of it yet...",
