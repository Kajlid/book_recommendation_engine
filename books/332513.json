  "description": "Have you ever wondered whom that lone shoe belongs to lying on the side of the road? If you could, would you pick it up and try and trace its owner? What about the gold necklace that has slipped away from a stranger’s neck? The soiled, holey sock? The woolen mitten? That floral umbrella left on the subway? Marigold is 14 going on 15 and wise beyond her years. Her time is spent in school, playing soccer and enjoying the company of her ‘young/old’ grandmother. She is confused about the stereotypes older people get saddled with and attempts to change that. Throughout her quest she finds lost items, makes new friends, helps lost souls and confronts her own shortcomings in an incredibly, candid portrayal of the people who cross her path. A story of enlightenment, growth, renewal and awareness – it will strengthen your outlook on life and your desire to strive for your ultimate best in the worst of times. The unique and diverse characters that are woven as “skillfully embroidered cherubims” strike you hard and deliberate enough to change your life forever. Wagner – 53 – retired lexicographer, downtrodden living alone in a bachelor apartment with brilliant mind and a heart of gold -one of Marigold’s rescued souls that becomes a mainstay in her life and a central character throughout the book. Reggie – Marigold’s teen colleague and fellow student who puts on a brave front while dealing with a mother who is mentally unwell– to name a few. Many more lives intersect and gel as each become entwined in the other’s lives. We learn, laugh and love throughout this incredible awakening journey of a patchwork of people thrown together to make a quilt of honour and respect.",
