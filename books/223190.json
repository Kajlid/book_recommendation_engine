If someone were stupid enough to do it, novels could be written and published with such titles as \" Moby Dick,\" \" Alice in Wonderland\" or \"Gone With the Wind.\" But also, by law, ownership of a title can be guaranteed if it can be proved that the original author has established such a connection with the title that any duplication would infringe that linkage.
