I will go as far as I must to be with the one I love.Those in power are suppressing the truth, and it all stems from the Coven of Vampyres strict law: Human and Vampyre fraternizationâ€”strictly forbidden. When living in a society where love, passion, and desire are restricted it isn't long before someone dissents. I just never thought that someone would be me.

He stalked me, he approached me, and now he wants me.We chose to break the rules, defy the Coven, and embrace this connection, regardless of the dangers that may unfold. However, our passion may reveal secrets the Coven may be willing to kill to protect. The Bloods Passion Saga is paranormal vampire romance tale of forbidden love for mature adults 18+",
