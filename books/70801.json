  "description": "When Sierra Graves takes a waitressing job on the SS Sapphire she doesn’t know she is going to be working on the “lust boat”. Being required to wear a bikini for the job is bad enough, but the sex parties that take place on deck have her body humming with need. There’s one thing that makes it all worthwhile—captain of the ship and former Navy SEAL Jack Hamilton. Jack can’t help himself when it comes to Sierra. She’s smart, beautiful—and off limits according to the rules of employment. It doesn’t take long for him to succumb to her seduction, say to hell with the rules and end up in her bed. But he doesn’t expect to fall in love with the woman. Love is a dangerous thing, especially when it looks like Sierra is part of a drug-running ring the DEA is after.",
