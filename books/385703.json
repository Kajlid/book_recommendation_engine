  "description": "If this is the end of the world, what do you do? Do you have the will to survive? And in surviving, what or who are you willing to sacrifice? With their city overrun by a plague of Biblical proportions and the dead rising with a preternatural and cannabilistic hunger for human flesh, a group of survivors is forced into answering those questions for themselves.  In the sheer act of survival, our heroes are pushed to the brink and expose the rawest essence of human nature and how it affects their relationships with one another and themselves.   About the Sean Schubert lives in Anchorage, Alaska, and writes part time. He is the proud father of two wonderful children and is married to the coolest wife he knows. The author earned a degree in English from Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana.
