  "description": "“I need you to pretend to be my girlfriend.”When those words left the lips of Damien Shaw, my childhood nemesis, I should have told him to kick rocks right then and there.But sadly, his scheme to impress his boss left me with something to gain from it too—getting my meddling mother, who was obsessed with my love life, off my back just in time for my parents’ thirtieth wedding anniversary celebration in Hawaii.You see, Damien and I grew up together, but we weren’t friends. No—we were rivals.And when we both moved out to California to go to different colleges, we promised never to think of each other again.It had been twelve years since we had been face to face, but when he kept popping up everywhere, I should have known that trouble would follow.And sure enough, during a lunch with my parents he told them we were dating.I was hellbent on exposing him, but then my mother’s reaction made it hard to say no. So, I ended up fake dating my enemy while trying desperately not to fall for him.My gut told me to keep my distance. But my heart? That bastard was falling for the man with every sweet gesture he made and every orgasm he gave me.But when the reason for our rivalry and our fake relationship comes to light, everyone and everything explodes, leaving one hell of a mess to clean up.I never thought I’d fall for Damien Shaw. I never thought my enemy could force me to figure out my life. But you know what they say—never say never.TW: toxic parental relationships",
