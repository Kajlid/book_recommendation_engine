  "description": "In the lost gardenthe remains of our dreams singsoftly in the rain失われた庭で私たちの夢の遺跡が歌う雨の中でそっとHalf Light is divided into four chapters–Clay, Rust, Blood, & Roots–which take an intimately reflective and raw visit to the past. To the place where we began. To the things that wounded us. To the skins we shed. To the creatures we became. To all the things we buried, and all the ways we can’t let them rest. This collection features interior watercolor art, and the poetry style is part stream-of-conscious memory and self-mythology.",
