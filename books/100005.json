  "description": "Detective Megan Matthews is cursed with always being right. Her instincts are good, and her deductive reasoning is even better. She's found her hard-headed ways to be too much for most men, so she's given up on trying to find Mr. Right and has settled for arresting Mr. Wrong. Crime scene photographer Ryan Andrews has had a crush on the sexy detective since he first took her photograph by accident at a crime scene. That picture became headline news and she hasn't talked to him since. He's tried everything to get her attention; but when nothing works he's left with only one option—is blackmailing a cop into marriage really a good idea?",
