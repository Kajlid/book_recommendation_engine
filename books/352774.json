Then the pipes in an upstairs bathroom burst and water inundates the floors below. Suddenly their cozy twosome is joined by a dozen plumbers, plasterers, and carpenters, who leave the house looking worse than the water damage.The only bright spot is that they won't have to deal with the town's hated building inspector, for the excellent reason that he has just been murdered. And most people in Hancock say they'd like to shake the hand of the man who did it. Susan has enough problems without trying to nail Simon Fairweather's killer; but she just can't resist, especially since chances are good that the murderer is actually at work in her bathroom....",
