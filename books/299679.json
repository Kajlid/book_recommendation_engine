  "description": "Sammie is one development deal away from a vice presidency at the Octave Corporation. Her lone obstacle is Sheriff Bill Donovan, who is hell bent on running the feisty redhead out before she can ruin his peaceful little town. Sammie is furious over Donovan's taunting and teasing, but she can't get the cocky, handsome-as-sin lawman out of her mind. He is the embodiment of her darkest fantasies. Donovan wants Sammie in his bed-now. It shouldn't be too difficult. He's noticed that she can't keep her eyes off his handcuffs. He intends to seize control, enjoy Sammie's body and use her for his own ends. When Sammie's sleazy colleague shows up with designs on the town and on Sammie, things get personal in a hurry. Donovan might have to choose between upholding the law and defending the woman who has managed to grab hold of his heart.",
