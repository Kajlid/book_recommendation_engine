  "description": "Kenni Lowry likes to think the zero crime rate in Cottonwood, Kentucky, is due to her being sheriff, but she quickly discovers the ghost of her grandfather, the town's previous sheriff, has been scaring off any would-be criminals since she was elected. When the town's most beloved doctor is found murdered on the very same day as a jewelry store robbery, and a mysterious symbol ties the crime scenes together, Kenni must satisfy her hankerin' for justice by nabbing the culprits. With the help of her poppa, a lone deputy, and an annoyingly cute, too-big-for-his-britches state reserve officer, Kenni must solve both cases and prove to the whole town, and herself, that she's worth her salt before time runs out.",
