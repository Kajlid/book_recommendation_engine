  "description": "Dana Mayo is a whiz at solving puzzles—but only the kind that appear in the daily newspaper. When it comes to matters of the heart, she doesn’t have a clue. After a disastrous attempt to track down the former love of her life, Dana determines to take fate into her own hands and find a new Mr. Right—preferably one who’s not already married. Soon she’s spending time with Hank, a hunky contractor who is restoring a neighborhood brownstone to its former glory. Handsome and loyal, he’s almost too good to be true—but she just can’t shake the feeling he’s hiding something. Enter Billy, a sexy brainiac who shares her passion for crosswords. He would be perfect, too—if she weren’t old enough to be his aunt. With crises looming on all fronts, Dana’s wits are about to be put to the ultimate test. Before she loses it all, she’ll have to figure out what she really wants—a puzzle that’s anything but black-and-white.",
