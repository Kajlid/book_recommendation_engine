When a tragedy strikes her and her husband though, she struggles with it. By the time she has her little girl, she canâ€™t seem to handle anything in her life so she flees. Thirteen years later, while living a charmed life in her new town, Stacy has been far removed from her days of old until a person from her past shows up and changes her life forever. One question forms in her mind: can she really leave her problems behind her or will they end up catching up to her?",
