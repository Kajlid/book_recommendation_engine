  "description": "Someone’s using me as leverage against my family. I was your average citizen, innocent of any crime worth going to prison for, and yet here I am. But this isn’t a regular prison ship. *Torture.* Experiments. They alter me. And when the ship crashes on an alien planet, some of my new abilities come in quite handy—it’s the side effects that aren’t entirely welcome. Not by me, anyway. The tribe of aliens that have taken me captive? They don’t seem to mind.  ~The Valos of Sonhadra series is the shared vision of nine scifi and fantasy romance authors. Each book is a standalone with a guaranteed Happy Ever After and can be read in any order.~**Note: Explicit content, sexual situations, and language warning.",
