  "description": "Opening yourself up to a whole new world can leave you vulnerable -- but it's the only way to grow. That's what Rip Cooper has to do when he learns he can perceive ghosts with his five senses as if they were flesh and blood people, and he's just as solid to them -- in fact, the only solid thing to them. This young loner has to overcome his fears and kill dead people to prevent them from corrupting the living. He works alongside an impure angel and his ex-best friend's ex-girlfriend as they teach him how love can conquer fear.RIP is a series of novelettes that tell one larger coming-of-age and redemption story.In this premiere episode, \"Touch,\" Rip may be a successful freelance photographer making a name for himself in a new town, but personally, he's in a rut. No friends, no goals, no greater purpose. He's going through the motions...until the \"angel\" Serissa informs him he's \"one of the Seven.\"",
