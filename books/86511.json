  "description": "From Dust to Man chronicles the emergence of women’s power, from a fledgling pursuit of tenuous equality—to complete and ultimate supremacy. What if an unspeakable tragedy changed every part of your existence? Those left—would they create a superior world order over that of the old? Women across the world are ignorant to the truth about their proximity to extinction. The religious clergy talks of hope and renewal while the government secretly spends trillions upon trillions on a scientific quest to capture the key to creation. A well-noted geneticist, Dr. Suzanne Wright defies nature, breaks all the rules, and produces an organically based life created by her secret process of parthenogenesis. Now there is hope. Wright has little time to revel in her accomplishments because she unearths a scandalous secret—600 years ago, a viral plague wiped out a human creature called man. All knowledge of man has been erased from history, science, religion, right down to his DNA. Unknowingly entangled in an epic governmental cover up, Wright is secretly asked to renounce blind loyalty and to bring back a male child. But how can she bring the male back in a societal sea of females that hasn’t ever known such a creature ever existed? Will she succeed or is it too late for man?",
