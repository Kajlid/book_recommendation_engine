When trauma hits her family, her past comes home and she is face to face with the love of her life that she thought she had lost forever. Does Liz dare to tell Tom he is her childs father? Did she dare tell her daughter? Tom had no idea he had a daughter. He is completely stunned to learn the whole truth that tore the two of them apart so many years ago. Even though he had moved on, he never forgot Liz or the love they shared. Their love is rekindled against all odds. But will fate be kind this time? Tammy, Toms wife, was killed in an earthquake; or was she? After over a year passes, someone claiming to be Tammy finds Tom online. Could this really be Tammy? Writing is a passion for me. I have enjoyed writing from the heart and using my imagination. The freedom to be the person I chose to be and in the locations I wish to travel. I have lived in North Carolina all my life, however I have enjoyed some travel away from home from time to time. \"",
