  "description": "Chicago Mafia boss Marco La Rosa thought the only woman he’d ever loved had died years ago. But when her brother approaches him with an arranged marriage contract, he learns that she is very much alive and in danger. Bringing her back within the fold of the Five Families is a second chance he can’t pass up. The only problem is, he has to get to her before their enemies do.  On-the-run Mafia princess Elena Caruso cut all family ties to survive. She knows that the Bratva is on her tail and that someday they’ll find her. When she receives word that her cover’s blown, she attempts to flee. But it isn’t the Russians who get to her first. It’s the boy she’s been in love with for years, who’s now a dangerous and devastatingly handsome man—and she’s running from him too.  As threats quickly close in, her only chance for survival is into the arms of the Mafia boss who once held her heart.",
