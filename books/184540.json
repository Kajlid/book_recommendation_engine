  "description": "The never before told story behind Hitler's secret program to breed \"The Master Race.\" Most of the chosen men were members of the SS; and both men and women were chosen on the basis of their shape, form and coloring. Blond and blue-eyed, the men tall, the women wide-hipped for childbearing, there were to create children \"of pure blood.\" The children born were graded; the most desirable were adopted and the others sterilized or eliminated. Documented for the first time is the wholesale kidnapping of hundreds of thousands of \"desirable\" non-German children from other countries for the purpose of adding to Germany's breeding stock; and never saw their families again - those that didn't pass genetic inspection were \"disposed of.\" It has now been proven that many of these \"Maternity Homes\" were simply whorehouses for the Gestapo.",
