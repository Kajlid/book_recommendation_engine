He doesn’t care that I’m his student. He won’t stop til I belong to him and he’s ruined me.I’m trying to resist him—Lord knows, I’ve trying—but my body screams for him. Why do I ache for him even though I know it’s wrong? How can something that feels like Heaven be a sin?He thought I was his redemption.Instead, he will be my damnation.He’s a broken man with a dark price to pay—a price I can’t pay again.

If you don't like your heroes over-the-top and obsessive, and you don't like your spice \"degrading\" and \"impactful\", walk away. Otherwise, strap yourself in and grab onto your \"oh shit\" handle, this is a roller-coaster that won't stop til the bitter end...",
