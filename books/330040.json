  "title": "Eraced: Uncovering the Lies of Critical Race Theory and Abortion",
  "description": "Tucked in the Old Testament book of Isaiah is a warning meant for ancient Judah, but it might as well have been written for twenty-first century \"Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness\" (Isaiah 5:20).Abortion and critical race theory are twin evils born of the same diabolical racism. And yet, there are many in the church who want to call them good, even as America begins to unravel under their influence.In ERACED, John Amanchukwu Sr. dispels the myths surrounding abortion and CRT, and uncovers the Left's sinister plot to destroy the black community and divide the church. Along the way, he brings to light important gospel truths to help all believers learn to think biblically about some of the most important and explosive issues of our day.Get it now.",
