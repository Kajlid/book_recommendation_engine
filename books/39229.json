  "description": "The Timothy Diary is the story of Paul's third journey as told from Timothy's unique first-century perspective. As the apostle Paul strives to establish churches throughout the Gentile world, his troubles with the Jewish world increase. In this book he resolves to train a select group of young men (an idea modeled after Christ and his disciples) to continue his work after him. Paul's vision for the church will come alive, particularly with the writing of the epistle to the Corinthian church.",
