  "description": "Foreword by Dr Karl Kruszelnicki, Earth Cries features the work of talented writers, artists and photographers from the University of Sydney community.Climate change is here, and how we react in the present will alter the course of the future; we can no longer deny that this is a key challenge for our times. Over the past two years, Australia has seen its worst bushfire season in recorded history, extreme floods and a global pandemic that brought about a renewed appreciation of nature.The contributors to this anthology tell powerful stories of devastation and hope. From chilling predictions of the future, to tree conservation movements in India, to an exchange between Siri and Alexa on environmental sustainability, writers and artists from the Sydney University community have come together to give voice to experiences of climate change, nature and the environment.Itâ€™s never been more important to keep the conversation alive.",
