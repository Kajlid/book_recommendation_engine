  "description": "Such joy in Celesteville! Babar and Celeste have had triplets. The smallest, Alexander, has a knack for getting into predicaments. Between getting stuck in the treetops and being chased by a crocodile, he certainly keeps Babar on his toes, but the king readily admits, “Truly it is not easy to bring up a family, but how nice the babies are!” The fifth Babar story is a wonderful and heartwarming salute to parenthood which every Mom and Dad will appreciate.",
