  "description": "“Get Your Farm in the Fight” - The Realities of WWII Come to a Wisconsin FarmFull of intrigue, adventure, and romance, this series celebrates the unsung heroes—the heroines of WWII. Only last year, Fannie O’Brien was considered a beauty with a brain, and her future shone bright, despite the war pounding Europe. With her father’s sudden death and her brothers overseas, Fannie must now do the work of three men on their 200-acre farm—until eight German prisoners arrive and, just as Fannie feared, trouble comes too. Someone seems intent on causing “accidents,” and Fannie is certain the culprit is one of the two handsome older Germans—or possibly both. Can she manage the farm, keep the prisoners in line, and hold her family together through these turbulent times? ​Don’t miss these other stories:The Cryptographer’s Dilemma by Johnnie AlexanderPicture of Hope by Liz TolsmaSaving Mrs. Roosevelt by Candice Sue PattersonMrs. Witherspoon Goes to War by Mary DavisA Rose for the Resistance by Angela K.
