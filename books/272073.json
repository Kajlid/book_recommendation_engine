  "description": "\"You play nice tonight.\"That's what I said to her as we walked into the restaurant. Hope Winters never failed me. She was anything and everything I needed her to be. A dangerous woman. Perfect. Effective. Mine. The deal should have been simple - mutually beneficial to both parties: Cane and Vico. An alliance. But then blood, bullets, and death began surrounding me, opening cage doors I'd closed down. That doesn't happen in my city, not unless I order it. Someone's to blame.And no one lies to me and survives.Not even Hope. \"Maybe you're worth it.\"Words I've longed to hear. After all this time, I was almost there. My perfectly crafted mission was nearly done. Years of scheming and seducing and it was all within my grasp. But I allowed myself to be distracted by him and didn't see the threat until it was too late. Falling in love wasn't part of the plan. Hell, love was a foreign concept to me, but it changed everything, and now I'm in too deep with a man more dangerous than anyone I've met. Benjamin Vico asked me for two things, and instead, I brought vengeance to his door. If there is one thing he'll never accept, it's treachery and deceit.And I've committed both. Revenge. Blame. Dark. Erotic. Romance.",
