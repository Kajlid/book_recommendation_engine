  "description": "Normalcy. It was the state Brad Miller had spent his entire thirteen years in. He had lived in the same white house on Dreis Lane his whole life. His mother and father were still together and happy. Even his eight-year-old brother Dylan had remained the same pain in the neck he had always been. From the time he woke up in the morning to the moment he slipped into bed at day's end, Brad could pretty much count on the same breakfast at 6:45, school until 2:15, soccer or hockey practice until 5:30, family dinner at 6:00, then homework. It never changed. Things have a tendency to change when you're thirteen years old.",
