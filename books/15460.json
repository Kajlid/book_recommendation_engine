  "description": "Jenny Lee covered her first year of marriage in the painfully real and funny book I Do. I Did. Now What?! Now it's time for her to write about the real love of her Wendell. Her dog.*Do you talk about your dog non-stop?*Do you suspect your dog is a genius?*Do you name each of your dog's toys?*Does your dog get more heavy petting than your spouse?*Do all holidays revolve around your dog?If any of these scenarios sound familiar, you probably have a healthy admiration for your dog. But if all of the scenarios in What Wendell Wants sound familiar, well, it's obvious that your appreciation of your pooch has truly crossed the line into true love--dysfunctional, sure, but who cares?!Jenny Lee knows this obsession inside and out, and her advice is not to fight there's simply no cure. Instead, she offers hysterical accounts of her own experiences--from fretting over her dog's haircut to getting his portrait painted a la Picasso to trying desperately to impress the Bed & Biscuit dog kennel--to give all kindred dog-loving spirits out there some consolation that they're not alone.",
