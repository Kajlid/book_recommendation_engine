  "description": "*𝙅𝙪𝙡𝙚𝙨:He was my shield from the outside world. My best friend. My protector. The boy next door, who promised he would never hurt me, never abandon me. But he did leave, and he crushed my already shredded heart in the process. I can’t forgive him, and yet… it was always him; it will always be him. Until every last star burns out. *𝘾𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙜𝙚𝙧:I promised her all the stars in the sky. And then, I ran. I ran because I was hurt. I ran because I was afraid. Because I was a coward. And now? Now, she’s back. The girl next door with the gorgeous smile and eyes that make me weak. But I’m not the same boy I was in high school. That boy is gone. My name is Charger now and I roll with the Steel Valley Chains MC. And while I can never be that guy for her again, I just cannot let any other man touch her either. Because it has been, and will always be, her. Until every last star burns out. **Charger is Book 1 of the Steel Valley Chains MC with a HEA. Told in first person, dual POV. 𝙋𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙚 𝙣𝙤𝙩𝙚: Some of the content found in Charger is not suitable for persons under the age of eighteen. This book contains the use of strong language, sexual content, and mild violence.",
