  "description": "\"Your whole life you have painted windows and sceneries on your blank walls. Suddenly one day you break through a piece of the wall and create an actual window into the real world. Now you are looking out and seeing what you don't understand because you have never been outside your room ... In your imaginary window the sun is an orange ball hanging in the top left hand corner. Through your real window you see the sunrise and sunset; you feel the heat on your face ... You hesitate to accept the reality you see...\"This book will take you on an adventure like one you've never experienced. Visions of constantly changing destinies and futures depicted in vibrant colors - this is what Pari sees. Mystified and confused, Pari initially hides her visions from others. She dismisses them as hallucinations.Guided by scrolls left to her by the spiritual master Chanakya, Pari needs to discover her powers and define her own destiny or risk being seduced by Arche's dangerous powers that threaten the balance between reality and illusions. \"I don't view my world as black and white with touches of grey. I prefer the full rainbow of colors ... As a child, if I saw the color red, and my guru/parent/guide in life, told me that wasn't red, it was black. Would I then think black every time I saw red? What would I think when I actually saw black? How would my brain resolve this obvious dilemma? Herein lies the crux of all our confusions, indecisions, misadventures and miseries. We don't understand the colors of the rainbow. If it's dark, we think black. If its light, we think white. And those who wish to discuss the variations philosophically call the other colors - shades of grey!\"",
