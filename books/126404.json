  "description": "Freelance journalist Colton West can't wait to finally end it with the rich and shallow Martin. Their relationship had been a mistake from the beginning. But just when Colton feels that he's made it clear to Martin it's over and he can move on with his life and career, he gets a phone call that will change his world forever.Whitfield, Vermont, is the sleepy little town where Colton grew up, a town he couldn't wait to leave. It's also the place where his best high school friend was found murdered years before, left on a road outside town that goes nowhere. The killer was never caught, although a stoic old man named George Hill, who lived with his young grandson in the only house on that road, was considered by many to be the prime suspect and passed away several years later.But now, another boy has been found dead at the end of that same lonely road, with his body eerily laid out in the same disturbing manner as Colton's best friend. And this time, the victim is Colton's fifteen-year-old nephew.With the original murder suspect deceased, Colton knows the killer of both teenagers is still on the loose, perhaps preparing to strike again, and Colton wonâ€™t rest in his investigation until he unearths the whole, ugly truth. Gay / Mystery / Detective / Suspense / Thriller / BDSM (Light)",
