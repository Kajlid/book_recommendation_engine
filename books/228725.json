  "description": "Words passed down one generation to the next; wisdom floating on the breeze season after season, diluted by time and distance. They still carry the strength of the sun and the brilliance of a million stars when you are confronted with their true meaning.Nate and Taz Ledek’s business is booming. All the hard work has made Mountain Mastery one of the hottest BDSM clubs in the country. Things seem to be falling into place… until they find themselves the unwitting stars in an erotic romance novel. While the tales of their sexual expertise might be flattering, the book also describes classified details of several of their SEAL missions. Someone close to them knows too much…the question is who.Every time Kodi Green is certain her life can’t get any more complicated… it does. But things look up when she gets her job back at Mountain Mastery. The best part is interacting with the two men who’d starred in her fantasies long before they’d even met. However, when their attention turns to her, she realizes she never truly knew the meaning of “complicated.”As the brothers search for the source of the leak, they are stunned to realize one of their employees is the woman they’ve been waiting for. What will it take to convince Kodi being with them is worth the effort? Can they exploit her obvious interest in the D/s lifestyle to their advantage? And how will they find the mystery author before too much is revealed?",
