  "description": "She is from a more enlightened time. Science when the how is no longer the limiter on the possible. Across the space-time continuum righting what once went wrong. Leave the mundane world behind and take a journey through time and space. Imagine the possibilities and the horrors. Imagine if accidents are no longer fatal as long as there is the faintest flicker of life. If the feast of justice could be served cold. If demagogues are impeded from power with universal mandatory suffrage.",
