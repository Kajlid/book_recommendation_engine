  "title": "The Widow Nancy Buck",
  "description": "It's the late 1880's and aging widow Nancy Buck is looking forward to spending her last few remaining years on the ranch her husband, John, carved out of the burning desert in Arizona. Being pressured by a local rancher to sell out, she can't help but wonder why. Why does the rich rancher desire her land enough that he's spending lives casually in an attempt to get it? Unlike most widows, this frontier-raised seventy-year-old is hard as granite, with little give. Her life has never been easy, and she's ready for whatever varmint comes her way. Joined by a friend of her husband, an old mountain man called Coon, Nancy and her son Isaac soon have their hands full keeping what is hers. She soon discovers her son is no fighter and it's as if he's not of the same blood. The showdown takes place in Tobacco Flats and only one man will walk away alive.",
