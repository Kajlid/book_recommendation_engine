  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B01LY7ECLB; note the new kindle edition doesn't include A Tale of Two DragonsIt's not always easy being a female warrior with a nickname like Annwyl the Bloody. Men tend to either cower in fear--a lot--or else salute. It's true that Annwyl has a knack for decapitating legions of her ruthless brother's soldiers without pausing for breath. But just once it would be nice to be able to really talk to a man, the way she can talk to Fearghus the Destroyer.Too bad that Fearghus is a dragon, of the large, scaly, and deadly type. With him, Annwyl feels safe--a far cry from the feelings aroused by the hard-bodied, arrogant knight Fearghus has arranged to help train her for battle. With her days spent fighting a man who fills her with fierce, heady desire, and her nights spent in the company of a magical creature who could smite a village just by exhaling, Annwyl is sure life couldn't get any stranger.She's wrong.  .  .And just wait until you meet the rest of the family.  .  .",
