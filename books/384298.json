  "description": "This first collection of macabre tales introduces to readers of books a fresh and original talent. Primarily a poet, Joseph Payne Brennan brings to the weird tale something of a poet's insight, a poet's conceptions, from the cumulative horror of the novella, Slime, the the unusual theme of I'm Murdering Mr. Massington. These are tales of terror deftly told, with a sure sense of scene and dramatic effect, particularly evident in such stories as Levitation and the haunting Canavan's Back Yard, stories which will linger in the memory long after being read.",
