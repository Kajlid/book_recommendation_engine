  "description": "Unnatural calm prevails. Trepidation builds. Silently, a storm gathers.   Survivors from mainland Europe and North America converge on Britain. Weary, confused, all come seeking answers; some are spoiling for a fight.  What began with the Cleansing and was hastened by the Beacon nears fruition. But time is running out, and human numbers are too few to win the last battle alone. Unless help can be found from the unlikeliest of allies, failure is assured.  Humankind faces its ultimate test. The Reckoning is upon us.",
