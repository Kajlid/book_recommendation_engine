  "description": "In the year 2019, a cataclysmic blast levels the city of Tokyo and triggers World War III. By 2030, the dazzling Neo-Tokyo rises from Tokyo's ashes, but the power that once sent the world to the brink of Armageddon-a being of monstrous telekinetic power known only as Akira-lives on in absolute-zero frozen stasis far below the city. Those who stand guard will stop at nothing to keep Akira from awakening, but an angry young man named Tetsuo, himself possessing of immense-and rapidly growing-psychic abilities, becomes obsessed with confronting Akira face-to-face. In time, Akira will surely awaken, and Tetsuo may be the only being potentially capable of controlling him, but Tetsuo is becoming increasingly unstable and violent, and a group including his former friend Kaneda sets out to destroy Tetsuo before he can release Akira-or before Tetsuo himself becomes so powerful that no force on Earth can stop him!",
