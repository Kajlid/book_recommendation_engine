ALl he knew was that Haville Svetz would be travelling back in time almost 2,000 years.But when he returns, Hanville Svetz won't be alone. If his mission is successful he will be accompanied by a creature long extinct - a spectacular birthday present for the Secreatary-General. His only hope is a picture from a children's book.
