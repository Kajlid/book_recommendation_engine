  "description": "Picture this: you’re sitting in a bar minding your own business, having a quiet drink or two, when trouble steps in off the street. A shambling wreck stumbles over the threshold, bloodied clothes torn, muttering incoherently. Just another idiot who doesn’t know when enough is too much. You raise your glass, take another slug. It’s okay, security can handle it.  But then over by the juke box a woman screams, a man swears loudly. You look up to see the barman drop the pint he’s pouring and back off, pale and shivering. Maybe you should turn around and take a closer look…  Then the world goes crazy. Before you know it, you’re shoulder to shoulder with security, fighting a wave of undead. Someone throws you a cue – a whole new meaning to the phrase ‘killer pool.’ When it’s over, there’s only four of you left; you, two hard men and the terrified girl you find hiding beneath the corpse of her boyfriend.  So begins the story of a new kind of world; where the dead are far more ambulant than they should be, and the living must walk amongst them, fighting to survive.",
