  "description": "I’ve been rejected. Twice.One tore our sacred union apart in the unholiest of ways, which led to a decade of unfathomable torment.The other saved me after I had escaped hell. He built me back up on the promises of love and a future only to walk away on the precipice of fulfilling our dreams.Both times I should have been broken beyond repair.And, for a brief moment, maybe I was.Thankfully, my third mate Titus, an unexpected gift in my darkest hour, has chosen to remain at my side.Now I’m back with a vengeance. Our current monarch is a twisted, tainted piece of scum that’s been dragging the dragon-shifters legacy through the mud. I’ll take the crown and fix what damage she’s sowed. Along the way, I will create enemies and place a target on my back, but I’m ready for a fight. I’ll show the world that Cleodora Eves is here to clean house.And my mates? If they thought their rejections stung me, they better move out the way because my rejection may just burn…\nThis series is not suitable for people under 18 years of age. This is a reverse harem series which means Cleodora does not need to choose which man she wants to be with. There are explicit sexual activities, foul language, and discussion of human trafficking. Please proceed with caution.",
