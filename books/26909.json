  "description": "Can love speak mind to mind? Link even with animal minds? Love is a powerful and mystical force to Rick, a dedicated non-violent liberationist. It enables him to communicate with animals, something he believes anyone can do. And why not? It's a perfectly natural result of the interconnection of everything on Earth.He calls his theory Mindstuff and communicates easily with Maggie the savage dog, but the aloof and resistant Cassie is a different matter.Under attack from a violent gang and beset with difficult relationships, Cassie, Rick and Maggie find themselves isolated in a vacant house for four fateful days. This interaction will change their lives forever.With Love in Mind explores not only the inexplicable power of love, but other mysteries of life as well.",
