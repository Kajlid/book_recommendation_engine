  "description": "From Wall Street Journal and USA Today bestselling author Lauren Landish comes The Virgin Diaries, a series of take-charge alpha heroes and the sassy, innocent women who bring them to their knees. I have a confession to make. I hate my math professor, Connor Daniels. From the moment he walked into class, he’s been a thorn in my side, nitpicking every little thing that I do. It burns me how he expects me to be just as perfect as he is. I get that professors are supposed to challenge their students, but he’s such a . . . He’s a dick. Cocky. Big-headed. Egotistical. So why can’t I stop fantasizing about him? Standing up there in his tight jeans, his bulge practically flaunted in my face. I picture the victorious way he’d smirk as he bent me over his desk, flipping my skirt up and taking me. Like it was inevitable. But here's the thing . . . I don't want him to just take my body, or my virginity. I want him to teach me everything. Listening Length: 3 hours and 47 minutes.",
