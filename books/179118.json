Which is exactly why she takes hot as hell guitarist Kye Burke to bed when he decides he wants her.One night. That’s how rockstars roll.Unless your name is Kye Burke. The quietest of all his brothers, Kye’s style has never really been pumping and dumping, so pursuing Chelsey isn’t a hard choice for him.
