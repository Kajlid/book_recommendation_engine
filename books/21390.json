  "description": "Hailed by the Chicago Tribune as an “utterly irresistible heroine,” Darlene O’Hara—the brilliant, hard-living, obsessive, and somewhat self-destructive detective introduced in Peter de Jonge’s acclaimed crime fiction masterwork Shadows Still Remain—returns in Buried on Avenue B.An edgy and suspenseful noir thriller, Buried on Avenue B traverses the gritty landscape of New York’s Lower East Side and the more sordid corners of Sarasota, Florida, as a gruesome and unexpected discovery in a makeshift Alphabet City grave heats up a 17-year-old cold case.James Patterson calls Darlene O’Hara “one of the freshest, hippest detective creations in many a year,” and the New York Times has described Peter de Jonge’s writing as “in the noirish, character-driven vein of Dennis Lehane or Michael Connelly.” For fans of serious crime fiction, Peter de Jonge is a must-read, and Detective Darlene O’Hara is cop to be reckoned with.",
