  "title": "Back to Hades: Eustice Seeney Returns to Hell",
  "description": "A man dies on the operating table and instead of seeing the white light goes to hell. Since it's all in his mind, all of the procedures performed to resuscitate him are seen by Eustice as really happening in the hereafter. It's a social commentary of sorts where he runs across the likes of Albert Einstein, Al Capone, Abe Lincoln, and a bunch of historical figures who explain to him their philosophies of hell. One of his attending doctors, knows what's happening, and is aware that even though Seeney is hallucinating by all accounts the reader can imagine-he really isn't, and that there is a real Satan who's intent on keeping him hell. It's woven in such a way as to explore how modern technology plays a part in determining good and evil and what we might consider a heaven or hell. It's an action adventure, science fiction, morality tale with unforgettable characters. I read the first book Go to Hell (I DID) Interview with Eustice Seeney by DD Cross, years ago, and the this sequel ten years later was exciting, hilarious, and the possibilities -you wouldn't believe who he runs into in \"The All New Hades\" is wild. A really imaginative, well executed book. Hats off to Cross-A physician, and scientist who knows how to weave a tale.",
