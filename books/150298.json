  "description": "Catch an angel, earn a fortune. Get caught by one, and you may lose your life. In the high stakes game of hunting for the fallen, you must be quick or you will be dead. Itâ€™s an honor to be recruited for service, but the game is not always what it seems. In a tough world where loyalties are murky, it takes guts, training, and luck to survive. And in a small Texas town, the world for one teenager is about to turn sideways.",
