  "title": "Juno Lucina",
  "description": "Her mother is a psychic artist, driven near to the breaking point by a husband bent on conformity and control. The ugly childhood scenes have burrowed into Tess' mind and festered there. Buried, too, are Tess' own fledgling artistic and psychic abilities - unwanted 'proof' of the same inherent evil that has destroyed her family and stalked her dreams into adulthood. Tess flees into the safety of a teenage marriage, not realising that the price of safety is her sense of self. When her husband, Alan, is tragically killed, the anger and dissatisfaction boil over and threaten to consume her. Sent upon a reluctant journey into the world of full moon rituals, witchcraft and unexpected violence, Tess is finally forced to confront the 'wolf' of her nightmares. She must learn anew to trust - her mother, her psychic instincts, and also Jeff, and[sic] unheralded admirer from her past.[book jacket edited]",
