  "description": "Room With a View:  Natalie has watched as the zombie plague devastated civilization.  Angus had been a miracle. Twenty-three years old and gorgeous he had appeared like Romeo from the pool area and thrown supplies up to her balcony. But now Angus is gone – abandoned her, which is probably for the best. She couldn’t stand to watch him die too.  Stranded four floors up and fenced in on all sides by the infected, food and water supplies are running as low as Natalie’s spirits. A lingering death from starvation seems inevitable.  But then she sees Angus striding for the pool gate with a sawn-off shotgun in his hands. Can he make it past the infected to reach her? And what will it mean if he does?  What Trouble Is:  112 days since the Zombie Plague struck, Lindsay Robertson's on the run, looking for a place to start over. Accidentally crossing paths with a tall, handsome Englishman was not part of her plan. But now both have drawn their guns and neither is willing to back down.  Trust is a lost commodity in the new world and Lindsay has more at stake than most....",
