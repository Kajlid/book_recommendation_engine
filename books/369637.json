  "description": "Ellis thought a gay friendly hotel sounded nice. He didn’t realise just how friendly the men there would be…Ellis is gay and out—technically at least. Unfortunately the only other gay man he’s acquainted with is his cousin Harry. When he suddenly gets the chance to visit a gay friendly hotel with his cousin, in exchange for paying his share of the petrol money, he assumes the impromptu holiday will be a nice gentle way to ease his way into gay society before he starts university in September.Dominant Mitchell Thompson has fond memories of the hotel where he came out almost two decades ago. He returns there every year, and always finds it to be exactly the same unashamedly kinky hook-up party it has always been. When he stumbles across a sweet little novice who’s obviously way out of his depth at the resort, his trip down memory lane suddenly becomes far more interesting.
