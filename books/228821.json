  "description": "Lissie Merriman has been harboring a closely held dream for decades, putting it on the back burner as she raised her children, cared for her own parents, and fought breast cancer. Now, as this strong and spirited woman is about to turn 70, she has decided it's time to realize her fantasy. But, the reaction from her adult children is mixed, especially her daughter, whose own dream is contingent upon Lissie denying hers and she begins to wonder: Are life changing adventures only for the young?",
