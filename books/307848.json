  "description": "Wiggins and Pyke are back for a second instalment in their series of Edwardian Murder Mysteries. London 1913. The Beast has been slain but the City now faces an even greater peril. London reels under multiple nefarious attacks including the threat of the deadliest of all diseases, The Plague, returning to scourge her people whilst a crazed multiple murderer stalks her streets. Unspeakable atrocities threaten to rip the heart not only from the families of DCI Wiggins and DS Pyke but also from the very Realm itself. The Russian Necromancer, Luca Radasiliev, conjures forth demons and creatures of the night whilst lunatics rise and an old enemy resurfaces to conduct a deadly vendetta intent on death and mayhem. Whilst the City quakes in terror and lesser men hope for salvation, two men fearlessly confront the dangers that threaten on all fronts. Pour the absinthe and hold onto your hat! If you thought the ‘Reign of the Beast’ was thrilling, get ready for the jaw-dropping second instalment of the DCI Wiggins series. Welcome to the Gallery of Death.",
