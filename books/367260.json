  "title": "A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century",
  "description": "The fourteenth century reflects two contradictory images: on one hand, a glittering time of crusades, castles, cathedrals and chivalry; on the other, a time of ferocity and spiritual agony, a world in chaos. Tuchman reveals the great rhythms of history and the grain and texture of the period's domestic life.",
