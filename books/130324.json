  "description": "\"My name is Rylee, and I am a Tracker.\" When children go missing, and the Humans have no leads, I'm the one they call. I am their last hope in bringing home the lost ones. I salvage what they cannot.\n Bringing my allies together as war approaches is my number one concern. But that means I have to play nice with a vampire who is blackmailing me. If I don’t, I’m screwed and my family is dead. But I don't play nice. And I have a backup plan. Kinda. Throw in some new weapons being developed that work around supernaturals and I have more problems than I can handle on my own.  Good thing I have a kick ass team. Even if they are on the other side of the world from me.",
