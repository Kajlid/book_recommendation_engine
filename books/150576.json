  "description": "A secret that tore them apart… Chloe Jamison has spent three years away from the love of her life for reasons she can’t reveal. When a scandal causes her to lose her job prospects as an interior designer, she has no one else to turn to except for the family that was once like her own. Architect Ryan Griffin waited five years for the girl he loved to be ready and then she dumped him for someone else after giving him her virginity. When she comes back into his life, needing his family’s help and wanting him back, he vows to protect his heart at all costs. An arrangement that has to be broken… Agreeing to give him her body whenever he wants it, Chloe soon realizes that having only a piece of Ryan will never be enough. When he comes to the same conclusion, they reignite their relationship while mixing business with endless nights of pleasure. Combining their talents in and out of the bedroom, it seems nothing can come between them this time. But, lingering issues with trust may end their relationship for good. Chloe and Ryan’s love for each other, along with the revelation of the secret from three years ago, may not be enough to get them past the hurt they have inflicted on each other a second time. Is love really worth it if you have to fight so hard to keep it? Recommended for ages 17+ due to sexual content.",
