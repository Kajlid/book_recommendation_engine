  "description": "He was an outsider, taking refuge from the past. She was an adored Cape Cod local. Their summer together changed both their lives, and when they find each other again, nothing will ever be the same…   As a headstrong teenager, Zach Stanley thought spending his summer at his aunt’s Plum Harbor inn was just an escape from his troubled life back in Arizona. Little did he know he’d end up meeting the love of his life, breaking both their hearts, and never forgetting her...   Confident spitfire Ashleigh Jones has long since moved on with her life, but remembers that summer as if it was yesterday—the joy, the passion, the promises they made. In the end, she had no choice but to forget about her beach-season boyfriend, Zach...until, nearly a decade later, she finds herself on an Arizona horse ranch that he just happens to own. Their reunion is more than a fateful coincidence—it’s a bitter reminder of all Ash lost. Can Zach explain his past demons and earn her forgiveness? Or is it too late for Ash to recapture those long-ago Cape Cod days...and risk her heart on Zach once more?",
