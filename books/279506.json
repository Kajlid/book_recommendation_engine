  "title": "Swisstory: The Untold, Bloody, and Absolutely Real History of Switzerland",
  "description": "Finally, the real history of Switzerland for clever kids and clever dukes slaughtered by filthy peasants, innocent \"witches\" hung up by their necks, buried gold, female mountaineers and, of course, all those murderous cows... Not the fake history of Heidi and William Tell, but 'Swisstory' - from ancient mountain people right up to women's right to vote. Hilariously illustrated by bestselling Swiss artist Michael Meister ('The Monster Book of Switzerland'), 'Swisstory' is outrageous, fascinating, gruesome - and completely true. For children from 9 to 99.",
