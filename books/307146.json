  "description": "He's a small-town single dad on a mission to reclaim his son.He’s also a dark-haired grump with ice-blue eyes and a smolder that will melt your underwear.I should never have climbed into the backseat of his car.Or fallen asleep without his knowledge.I try to look on the sunny side of things.Yes, I lost my cake business and my ability to visit my sick dad.It’s possible I was a little (uncharacteristically) drunk…But when I woke up, speeding down the freeway in the middle of the desert, he didn't leave me on the side of the road barefoot.Instead, we picked up his hilariously handsome younger brother, and what happens on the road between California and South Carolina changes all our lives.From fleeing state troopers to dodging crooked tent revivalists to uncovering (accidental) gay porn stars, we learn a lot about each other.He’s growly, a bit overprotective, and good in a fight. But beneath that crabby exterior is a sweet alpha-roll.And in our shared motel room, the fire between us melts his walls and my heart. Now I only hope when we reach our destination, he’ll see what we have is more than a road-trip romance. We’ve found something true.(THIS MUCH IS TRUE is a single-dad, opposites attract, grumpy-sunshine romance with a touch of forced proximity. No cheating. No cliffhangers.)",
