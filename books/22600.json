  "description": "Micah is a liar. She tells you on the first page and promises that even though she is from a family of liars, she will stop. Or at least try. She promises that she will tell you her story and it will be the truth. If only you will trust her. This beginning sews so much doubt into the reader’s mind that it immediately becomes almost impossible to know what is true. Micah goes to a selective school in New York. She has no real friends, except Zach and when he disappears from her life, she is left with no one. She reveals brief glimpses into her life. She has a brother Jordan, two parents and family who live as survivalists upstate. She also meets a boy in Central Park who likes to run like she does. But why does he stare at her like he knows her somehow? And should we trust Micah when every so often she will write a chapter where she admits she has been lying still, but now she promises, she wont lie anymore. And then breaks her promise. This is a fascinating book of twists and lies and omissions, leading you to an end where you have to make your own mind up as to what really happened, which sounds unsatisfying, but it isn’t one bit. Trust me.",
