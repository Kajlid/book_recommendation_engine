After much searching among piles of greasy toaster ovens and wet smelly socks, hespies a box filled with specks and a wrinkled note that says, \"Put thesewondrous riches in the earth and enjoy.\" Horrified to learn that thievesare after his treasure, the boy scrounges the junkyard and conjures a creature to stand guard - a scarecrowlike gardener with crooked bony arms, a giant belly, a jaunty crown, and preternatural Frog Belly Rat Bone, king and protector of the specks.With subtle, delicate tones, fantastical figures, and bursts of glowing color, the surreal artwork and hand-lettered text of Tim Ering’s picture book debut exude all the whimsy of an inspired imagination - and the wonders of a natural world that awaits discovery, even in Cementland.Included with each a whimsical full-color bookmark offering abehind-the-scenes glimpse at the artist, his technique - and his inspiration!",
