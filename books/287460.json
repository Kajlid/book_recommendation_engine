  "description": "Have you ever felt overwhelmed, suffocated, and stressed out by the amount of clutter in your life? \n\nAre you ready to break free from the confines of having too much “stuff” but not sure where to start? \nThe truth is… you probably have too many things taking up unnecessary space in your life. But what you might not know is that those things are weighing you down in more ways than one...  Think about it: all the dirty dishes piling up in the kitchen, those “just in case” items you keep in the garage, or Christmas presents you stuck in the back of your closet (which you knew you’d never use) aren’t just taking up physical space -- they’re stealing your mental space, too.  Sure, you might be able to ignore all the clutter for a short while, but it’s only a matter of time before the messiness causes unwarranted stress, embarrassment, and anxiety.  However, it doesn’t have to be this way… clearing out the clutter to make space for more money, time, creativity, and relaxation is easier than you think.  How to Change Your Life with Minimalism  Contrary to what many believe, decluttering and tidying up your home isn’t just about shuffling things around or throwing away items. It’s about consciously organizing your life to make room for prosperity, abundance, and happiness.

Every time someone visits your home, they’ll continue to ask how you keep things so organized!  Even if you have hoards of unnecessary things piling up like mountains, Olivia Telford shows you the little-known ways to declutter your life top to bottom.
