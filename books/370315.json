  "description": "By night, teenager Yoshimori Sumimura is a \"kekkaishi\"--a demon-hunter who specializes in creating magical barriers around his prey. By day, Yoshimori's got other demons to battle: an addiction to sweets and a seriously crotchety grandfather! Yoshimori's pretty neighbor and childhood friend, Tokine Yukimura, is also a kekkaishi, but their families are feuding over who is the true practitioner of the art.With many questions left unanswered, Yoshimori and Tokine escape Headless Island. All is peaceful back home at the Karasumori Site...until a mysterious fissure cracks open the school grounds. Then Mt. Okubi, the largest of the mystical sites, is attacked, and its enraged guardian deity goes on a rampage! The Shadow Organization sends a powerful, polite young man to help guard Karasumori--but can he be trusted? And who needs help anyway?!",
