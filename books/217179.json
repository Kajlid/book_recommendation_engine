  "description": "[Alternate cover edition for ASIN: B00KTOKA66]Ronald Covington has been medically diagnosed as transgender, but has a mother who can’t accept her teen daughter—or even the concept of being feminine. Connie McPherson, a close friend, recognizes that because of their past, neither of the Covingtons knows what it means to be a girl or woman. Connie struggles with a past as well—the death of her daughter. A compromise is reached: Ronald will come to live with Connie as Jessica. Over time they will try to heal and learn what it means to be female—and more importantly, to be fully human.",
