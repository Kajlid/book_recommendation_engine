  "title": "The Liars' Club",
  "description": "This memoir of growing up poor in a Texas refinery town is from a time long gone but from a place that feels eternally rural south. A handful of the town's workers gather regularly to drink salted beer and spin tall-tales. They're the Liar's Club. And to the girl whose father is the club's undisputed champion, they exude a glamour that lifts her from ordinary life. But there are other lies, darker, mmore hidden. A mad, puritanical grandmother; a vast inheritance squandered in a single year; endless emptied bottles; and the abuses inflicted on an eight-year-old girl -- these are the demons that the author must exorcise. Felled with wit and stripped of any self-pity, THE LIAR'CLUB is a contemporary classic. (from the jacket).",
