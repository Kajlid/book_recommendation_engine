In the award-winning \"Disturbing the Peace,\" honorable mention in the 2010 Rope and Wire short story competition, a sheriff experiences a revelation about himself and his relationship with the people of his town, while in \"The Outlaw's Wife,\" a country doctor worries that his young friend is falling for a married woman whose husband is rumored to be a wanted criminal. From the suspenseful \"Cross My Heart\" to the comedic romp of \"A Rangeland Renaissance,\" to a Western twist on star-crossed romance in the title story, \"The Ranch Next Door,\" these stories will appeal to a variety of readers, as well as established fans of the traditional Western. These seven stories total approximately 40,330 words or 160 book pages.",
