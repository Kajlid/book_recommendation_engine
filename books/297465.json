  "description": "The battle for Torredo is over, but the war has just begun...  Jack Gamble’s lover is a double agent. Norse betrayed the resistance and now commands Galilei's military operations. Rallying what remains of the resistance and their galactic allies wasn’t part of Jack’s plans. His contacts are scattered, maybe dead. Streams are broadcasting his face from one end of the galaxy to the other, and mercenaries under the command of Captain Ben Stone intercept his ship. Space pirates, friendly interrogators, security grunts, and Norse stand in Jack’s way. Can he trust Stone? The intriguing captain has his own problems with the empire - and an interest in Jack. Jack isn’t looking for a one-night stand, and any emotional entanglements need to be off the radar. He has a rebellion to win and a world to take back. Failure means his people will never break the empire’s chains, and his homeworld is screwed. Norse already did that to him. He won’t let it happen again. ECHOES OF THE STORM is an action-packed science fiction adventure with a gay protagonist, ace pilots, undercover spies, special forces teams, some wild battles, and a slow-burn romance.",
