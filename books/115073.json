  "description": "A young mothers story of parental alienation and her account of dealing with a barrage of lies in the court room. The fight turns dirty when the father disappears with the child and leaving a trail of tormented tears with almost no clues as to where he could be.Parental Alienation is an act of brain washing a child to dislike and not trust the other parent. Quite often accusations of abuse are the same abuses that are happening, but actually coming from the accuser. The syndrome stays even after a victimized child becomes an adult. Very few alienated adult children want to communicate with the parent that was shut out.Parents of adult estranged children cope with the loss just as great as when the alienation first began.I want people to know my story. If I can help only one person with my experience, I have done well with this book. I may never see my little boy ever again, but I will never stop hoping that we can reconnect on some simple level. I hate the thought of leaving this world without even saying to him, \"I love you\" just one more time.Review by Ina I.Parental alienation is a touchy and controversial subject. Despite the divisiveness on this enigma, one issue that few will debate is the fact that too many children are caught in a \"tug war\" between their separated parents, and they are suffering the consequences.“Scar on my heart” highlights well the behavior of a hostile parent who will lie and deceive and manipulate and who will stop at nothing to achieve the only things he is after-Power and control over his EX.",
