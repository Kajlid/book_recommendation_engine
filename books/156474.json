  "description": "alternate cover edition of ASIN B00N1BXC8CHe's a broken alpha. She's his sexy intern. Mia is just a college girl trying to earn her business degree and dig out of the poverty she was born into—being a shifter is something she hides, hoping her secret won’t sabotage her dreams. Shifters live in the shadows of Seattle, after all, dangerous and generally criminal. At least, that’s what she thinks until a wolf saves her from an attack in an alleyway… and then turns up as the hot boss at her new dot-com internship. Lucas is a broken alpha, a wolf who lost his mate, his pack, and almost himself—he wasn’t looking to rescue a girl or start a pack war. But now he has to keep her safe or it won’t just be her life, but his whole family at risk… only his inner wolf can’t seem to keep its paws off a girl who has secrets of her own. True Alpha (Shifters of Seattle 1) is a complete story with HEA, approximately 410 pages or 100,000 words. It contains scorching hot shifters and sexy interns—only readers over 18 should dive into the steamy world of Shifters in Seattle.",
