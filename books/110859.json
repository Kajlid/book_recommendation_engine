  "title": "I Dream of Zombies",
  "description": "A zombie novel set in London over six weeks in 2013, with a strong female lead character. It starts with a dream and then the nightmare takes over. It all begins on a summer’s day with the media reporting with some hilarity that people are dreaming of the dead coming to life, but those who have dreamt them are convinced they are a warning of things to come. Marla takes it all with a pinch of salt until she experiences the nightmares herself. Cue paranoia and disbelief until reality shows its new face. All over London there are incidences of people becoming sick and aggressive. As the attacks mount, the media is forced to take the matter seriously, but what is causing it? Is it a virus, and is it natural or man-made, and is the government responsible? Marla, her sister, Ellen, and friend Tommy find themselves fighting for their survival as their sense of reality is smashed. Will the army and police maintain control or will the country find itself in lock down, isolated from the outside world? “Good character development, good descriptions...and friggin' scary” – Stewart Bint.",
