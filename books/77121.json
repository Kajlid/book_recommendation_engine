  "title": "Love, Acceptance and Forgiveness: Equipping the Church to Be Truly Christian in a Non-Christian World",
  "description": "How can the Church be a healing force in the world? In this long-time bestseller now revised and update, authors Jerry Cook and Stanley C. Baldwin suggest that it is only when believers admit their own brokenness that they can love, accept and forgive those who are hurting around them and put out the welcome mat to their community. They offer clear teaching about the Church in a hurting world, and as veteran leaders who practice these principles; they speak from experience, not theory. Through touching true stories and practical guidelines for connecting with fallen, sinful people, Cook and Baldwin announce the good news. The church is not broken and it is the broken people who can change the world.",
