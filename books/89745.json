Raised by the same clan that destroyed his family, he has trained his entire life for the moment when he can strike back against the clan and show them that he is far from broken.There's only one problem: Sil, the blond-haired, blue-eyed son of the chief who, despite Sirian's wishes to the contrary, has snared Sirian's heart.As the ceremony marking Sirian as a full-fledged hunter of the clan arrives, he must make the most difficult choice of his life--betray Sil and destroy the clan that murdered his family, or betray his family and embrace a future at Sil's side?",
