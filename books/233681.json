  "description": "He played my body like a piano with his strong, skillful hands. ~ DMITRI ~I want to put my hands all over her,but they're too busy writing my fantasy instead of living it.I'm so used to spinning love stories in my head that I've lost track of the one in my heart.I'm finished being a loveless prisoner to the page.Now I want the real thing - and I think she's it. ~ SAM ~He watches me with those dark, sensitive eyes of his, melting me.He knows my pain. Maybe he shares it.He brushes the hair out of my eyes with his fingers and it drives me insane.I think he's the music I've been looking for all along.The College Obsession Romance series centers around a group of friends and the relationships they form during their time at a small-town Texas school. They are angsty, steamy new adult novels with HEAs and NO cheating. Although they are obsession-themed romances, there are no stalkers or psychos!Though this is the third book in the College Obsession Romance series, it can be read as a standalone. For the most emotionally-satisfying experience, however, it is recommended to read this series in order, staring with \"Read My Lips\", followed by \"Beneath The Skin\", and then concluding in this novel.",
