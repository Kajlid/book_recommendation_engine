  "title": "The Slow Poisoning Of America",
  "description": "A comprehensive text revealing the terrible history of fluoride in the drinking water, Monosodium Glutamate and Aspartame in the food supply, and the many published scientific studies that show the physical ailments these substances trigger. This is the first book ever published that reveals the connection between MSG and the epidemic of Autism. Also included are chapters on the benefit of a natural zero calorie sweetener and a natural hormone proven to reduce breast and prostate cancer.“\nThis is some book. The thesis, as you might guess, is that we are being poisoned. What makes it potent is that every charge and detail is footnoted; this is a work of scholarship\n.” - Piers Anthony“\nThe problem with this book is that it is too true, and when something is too true, the public is not ready for it\n.” - Dr. Wayne McDermott, MD, Virginia“\nThis book is a Bible for all those who want to eat healthier and live longer lives\n.” - Dr. Christer Johannessen, Director of Undergraduate Physics Laboratories (retired), KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden",
