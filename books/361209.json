  "description": "2012 came and went.Â  The world prepared itself for impending disaster--and nothing happened.Â  Or so it seemed.Â Â \nBut by 2020, energy from a supernova is disrupting the sun. Solar storms ravage the globe with unprecedented ferocity, and debris in the form of comets and asteroids threaten to end life on earth.Â  The wealthy of the world hide in vast underground bunkers, but even they know that they cannot survive without a miracle.Â  \nIt all comes down to one manâ€”a young psychiatrist named David Fordâ€”who may hold the power to save the world.Â  Newly employed at the extravagant Acton Clinic, Ford encounters people who seem to understand what's happeningâ€¦ some may even possess an extraordinary knowledge of whatâ€™s to come.Â  One of them is the beautiful and enigmatic Caroline Light, who demands more from Ford than he could possibly giveâ€¦ another is cunning ex-CIA operative Mack Graham, a skilled killer with questionable loyaltiesâ€¦\nDecember 21, 2012 was not the end.Â Â \nThe end is The Omega Point: where time stops.Â",
