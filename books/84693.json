  "description": "Summer Heat is a nobody in NYC, but when ladies are murdered from the society gala she’s volunteered at the past three years, she’s suddenly in the limelight as a suspect and as the lover of two sexy brothers who’ve dated most of the unlucky women. Referred to as the Society Murders, terror grips the city as the FBI tries to protect the women and find the killer. As successful businessmen, Max and Logan Preston have found the lady of their dreams. She’s smart, witty, gorgeous, and refreshingly down to earth, and they don’t mind sharing—but not with a serial killer who’s coming for her when he finishes his list. Keeping her safe is the priority. Keeping her forever is a necessity.",
