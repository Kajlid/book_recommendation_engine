  "description": "Love may win yet in this delightful Christian, romantic comedy that follows two widowed neighbors who agree to join their antic-filled families for the sake of convenience. Jessie Vaughn has fallen in love with her husband but refuses his advances until sheâ€™s loved in return. Corbin, although more than willing to share his bed, fears to share his heart. As Christians will they choose to trust God, or let pride war against their marriage? Join this uproarious household as they struggle through riotous pranks by their children, nuances of their cat-crazed British neighbor, a waitress who presumably escaped a happiness cult and many more moments sure to keep you laughing.",
