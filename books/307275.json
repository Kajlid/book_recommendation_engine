  "title": "Deadly Encounters",
  "description": "Deadly Encounters is based in Murrells Inlet, SC. It's a thriller based on fictional characters identifiable to the South Strands hodge podge mix of transplants from every corner of our country. The restrictions in place caused by a virus are partly the reason the Deadly Encounters happen, but after reading you'll see the underlying reasons. I wrote this book after many months walking Brownie at Huntington beach park and creating the characters and stories while collecting shells and watching the sunrise each morning.thomaszegray.com",
