  "description": "The 25th Anniversary of the Groundbreaking Classic. \"If there was any doubt about the need for social transformation in 1970, that need is clear and urgent today....I am now more convinced than ever that the conflict and suffering now threatening to engulf us are entirely unnecessary, and a tragic waste of our energy and resources. We can create an economic system that is not at war with human beings or nature, and we can get from here to there by democratic means.\"--from the new Preface by Charles A. Reich.",
