  "description": "\"I have no idea what I'm doing. Being homeless was easier than this. How did I end up with a super-power, and what good is making holes, anyway? Especially when terrifying monsters are all that come out of them...\" Fifteen year old Taylor Brock was homeless, and she liked it that way. No one to tell her what to do, where to go, the works. So when Evan, a boy who claims to be able to control fire, tells her that she needs to come with him, she's more than a little skeptical. But then he proves his ability, calling forth a fiery phoenix when someone tries to kill her. \"Color me convinced. And where do we go? The Flagship. A haunted hotel turned boarding school complete with superpower classes, a mean girl that throws lightening and a boy who I just can't get a handle on. That happens to control gravity.\" Oh, and don't forget Taylor's forgotten imaginary friend, who turns out to be not so imaginary after all, in a very horns-wings-and-trying-to-take-over kind of way.",
