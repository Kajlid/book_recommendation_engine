  "title": "Determined Look: Life Lessons of a Youth Football Coaching Legend",
  "description": "“Determined Stories of a Youth Football Coaching Legend” is written by Three Year Letterman, a thirty-nine-year old college dropout who lives in a Northeast Georgia. He is the coach of a youth football juggernaut. Unlike many youth coaches, Coach Letterman rejects the notion that the purpose of youth sports is to have fun and instead adopts a win-at-all-costs approach. This sometimes involves him intentionally trying to make players quit, recruiting players that he knows are too old for the league, and “altering” residency papers. Coach Letterman is also very proud of the fact that he “rakes in $29.35 an hour plus bennies and a cell phone” and “lives in an apartment complex with a pool and computer lab.” He lettered for three years in high school football at wide receiver. He still wears his letter jacket to this day and stands in the student section when he watches high school football games. He’s also a rabid University of Georgia football fan who takes takes pride in the fact that he barks at opposing fans. This book includes twenty-eight chapters of Coach Letterman offering youth coaching tips and opining on a variety of topics. Topics include “How to Attend a High School Football Game and Post-Game Field Party in Style,” “Turning the Local School System from Adversary to Co-Conspirator,” and “How to Dominate a Deposition.”",
