At least the police think it’s the Bishop – it’s impossible to be sure, since someone has made off with his head.Fifteen-year-old Frank Sampson is the forensic sorcerer on the case. But he is easily distracted. By Kazia, the supposed victim’s beautiful, and possibly dangerous, niece. By Marvo, his police colleague, who seems dead set on making his life difficult. By the terror that he's losing his Gift – the ability to work magic. And by all those stupid rules which get in the way of proving that everybody is wrong about the case . . . except Frank.Donald Hounam has wrought a sharp, exciting, original new voice in teen fiction.",
