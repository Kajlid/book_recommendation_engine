  "description": "The Baby Boomer Generation sings out loud, clear, and funny in this kid-friendly multimedia package. Author/illustrator Sandra Boynton and composer Michael Ford has enlisted a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame roster of performers to belt out such children's ditties as \"Rabbit Tango,\" \"One Shoe Blues,\" and \"Speed Turtle,\" sung here by Beach Boy Brian Wilson. Also making appearances on the CD are Gerry and the Pacemakers, B.Â B. King, Davy Jones, Neil Sedaka, and Patti LuPone. Another Doo-Wop shop triumph for the authors of Rhinoceros Tap and Dog Train.",
