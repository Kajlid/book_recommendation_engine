  "description": "Our love affair wasn't what everyone wanted it to be. It was raw and full of absolute joy and unbelievable pain. My love for her had consumed me for years and now that Kaye was mine, I was never letting her go. I knew the consequences of our affair would be devastating and hated to see the hurt in Claire's eyes. I thought it would be so easy to just walk away...start a new life. I didn't expect to feel so conflicted about leaving. I needed her. She was my lifeline and we were determined to get our happily ever after....until one day, one event, one conversation threatened it all. \"I had to know what went wrong. My stomach was sick with grief and I didn't know what to do next or even how to help Kaye. I needed to get to her. It didn't matter what Rob or Claire thought. No one could stop me from going. I knew she needed me. I could feel it deep in my soul.\" Jake(less)",
