  "description": "The 1970s are coming to a close, and while Sterling Jackson’s city is in the midst of summer, change is here and cannot be avoided. Sterling lives a life full of recreation and little work, on account of his older brother Miles, the powerful drug dealer known around the city as Jamaica Jackson, who gives Sterling near anything he asks for. Charity, the woman he is dating, does much the same. Yet, Sterling will soon be dared to come to grips with the forces that have shaped what he has become, through his relationship with his mother, with whom he shares a unique bond, two of Miles’ closest peers, a homegrown celebrity singer, and a mysterious man bordering insanity. This summer, death is lurking under the hot sun. A story of family, love, hate, criminality, and one man’s journey to find meaning, Return to the City is one to remember.",
