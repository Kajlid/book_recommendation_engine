  "description": "The coveted erotic edition of the celebrated first novel in The Stone Masters Vampire Series.  Daumia Velde will be paying for his brother's death for the rest of his life. Not because he is guilty, but because those who are guilty need a scapegoat. Daumia would be dead himself were it not for the assistance of Sunaria, a mysterious woman appearing in the nick of time from the ghostly night of the graveyard.  After years of serving the corrupt Roelle at his ranch in Spain, Daumia at last begins to think of his freedom - of paying back the men who accused him and finding a way to rise in the world. What he cannot foresee is the extent of his danger or the depth of the depravity of those who would hide their own crimes behind his ignorance.  Freeing himself from their deceptions may take more than Daumia is prepared to give. It may, in fact, require his very life.  In this sweeping saga of betrayal and corruption in 15th century Spain, VMK Fewings introduces us to her epic Stone Masters Vampire Series. This is the story of the man who would become one of the most powerful vampires in history. Behind the legendary Orpheus is the history of a conflicted man fighting for his place in the world - and before that, a young boy who was not meant to survive the graveyard.",
