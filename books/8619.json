  "description": "\"When I Loved Myself Enough\" is a collection of wisdom that is startling in its simplicity. By the end of the book, the message becomes loving yourself holds the key to loving others and having others love you. By sharing her insights, the author also shows us how to feel the same sense of peace and quiet joy that illuminated her life. This book began as one woman's gift to the world, hand-made by Kim McMillen and handed out to friends. After Kim's death, her daughter Alison continued making the books - and word of mouth turned this into an underground bestseller in America. 'No one feels like they're enough. This book teaches you how to feel like you are enough so you can operate from self-reliance and self-love. Thank you for this book, I love it' - Mark Hansen, co-author of \"Chicken Soup for the Soul\".",
