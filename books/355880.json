The first Christmas cards were printed and sold in the United States by a German immigrant in 1874. Long ago, eating pie was believed to bring good luck, and during the holidays they were baked in an oblong shape to look like a manger.The message of Christmas is a message to all the world and is beautifully conveyed and illustrated in S is for Star.

In France, he is called Pere NoÃ«l. In Italy, Befana brings presents, and German and Austrian children wait for a visit from the Christkindl.Celebrate these and many other traditions of the holiday season with S is for Star: A Christmas Alphabet.",
