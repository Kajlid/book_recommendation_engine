  "description": "'One courageous woman'This true life story of one courageous woman demonstrates the awe inspiring strength and resilience of the human spirit, in the face of what to many of us would seem to be insurmountable adversities.Born into a better off than average 1950s home, with strict but loving parents Iris was a tough, independant and adventurous child until the age of eleven years, when her childhood was shattered by a brutal sexual assault that seems to have triggered a chain of disastrous events. Over many years Iris somehow managed to survive forced teenage marriage, domestic violence, brain haemorrhage, Cancer and much, much more.Dogged by disaster after disaster Iris nonetheless perseveres with astonishing resilience, snatching fun and laughter at every opportunity, making her story a powerful source of hope and inspiration.",
