  "description": "[Alternate cover and retitled edition for ASIN: B01JRFWDMG]This sh*t could get me killed, but I’ll risk it all to make her mine.  I’m not a good man, but I’ve never claimed to be. I’m the muscle for the Valetti crime family, and I fit the part with my hard, ripped abs, broad shoulders and cocky attitude.  I’ve never wanted for anything, until I met her. A woman I can never have.  She’s a cop, and I’m a suspect in her case. Just being seen together would put a target on both our backs.  She may be a sweet little thing, but she’s a badass at heart with a spitfire attitude. She’s f*cking perfect. I can’t help imagining those lush, sassy lips wrapped around the one part of me that doesn’t give a damn she’s off-limits.  All I wanted was a taste of her tempting, forbidden curves. One moment of hot, wild passion, and I’m f*cking addicted.  She’s too good for me, but that’s not gonna stop me from taking her. Everything and everyone else be damned. I’m making her mine.    This is a standalone, full-length mafia romance with a filthy-mouthed, possessive bad boy and no cheating. Guaranteed HEA.",
