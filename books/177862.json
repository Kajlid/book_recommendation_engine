  "description": "Brook Holliday has set sail on her honeymoon cruise…only she’s missing a husband. Her fiancé fled town just two weeks before the wedding, and although distraught, Brook departs for the Caribbean with her sister in an attempt to turn lemons into frozen daiquiris. Soon after boarding, Brook meets Scott Webster, an aspiring writer who lives just miles from her back home. Forget cabana boys. He gets her cylinders firing again, but turns out to be traveling with a vixen determined to stake a claim on him. Despite the obstacles, Brook and Scott form a connection and start to date back on land. When both their rocky dating histories catch up to them, however, Brook becomes torn between her attraction to Scott and her need to heal. Family and friends help Brook reshape her life, but good company and wine can only do so much. The solutions to her personal and professional woes must ultimately come from within, requiring her to face ugly truths and make some bold changes. Taking place in the Caribbean, Kansas City, London, and Chicago, Unbridled Holiday tells the story of a bride who didn't make it down the aisle, but ends up in a much better place.",
