  "description": "'Destiny's Forever' is the long awaited conclusion to the story of Lucy and James that we loved in 'Destiny's Foreshore' and 'Destiny's Hollywood.' The third and final instalment of the story between Lucy and James picks up where the 2nd book finished. Lucy has just announced that she's pregnant with James' baby. Under any other circumstances this would be a cause for celebration, but these two are not your average couple. He's a world-famous movie star, and she's the girl who has held his heart for over 20 years. Destiny allowed them to find each other again, and they are now trying to make their way as a couple with a ready-made family. But a baby? This was not on their plan at all. Throw in the demands of life in Hollywood, a devastating event that neither Lucy or James know how to deal with, and the fulfilment of a teenage dream come true for Lucy, and the scene is set for an exciting, sad, romantic, loved-up ride you will never forget.",
