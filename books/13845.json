  "description": "Craig is 16 when he returns from a drug-fueled visit with his dad in Miami to find his mom leaving town with her 23 year-old boyfriend. In the same moment, his dreams of settling down with his pregnant girlfriend are dashed when she is moved off to Texas by her parents. Left alone in small town Oklahoma, he embarks on a deranged, cross-country quest for a family of his own. STILL LIFE WITH BRASS POLE is Craig Machen’s funny, debauched and heartfelt memoir about young love and coming of age in the titillation business. And how a roaring White Knight Complex, an eccentric comedy club owner, and a trio of unpredictable striptease artists conspire to help him achieve his aims.REVIEW\"Still Life With Brass Pole\" is the product of a great story teller with a great story to tell. Craig Machen’s earnest and brutally honest recounting of his teenage search for love and family is weird, hilarious, fast paced, upbeat and straight from the heart. An absolute joy to read.\" -- Curtis Grippe, The Arizona Republic\"Still Life with Brass Pole\" has its own unique charm and is a read that should strongly be considered.\" -- Carl Logan, The Midwest Book Review\"Still Life With Brass Pole\" is Craig Machen's remarkable memoir about coming-of-age as a strip club bouncer, finding his way amidst a culture of sex, alcohol and drug abuse, and dysfunction, and finally realizing his dream of becoming a dad. Still Life is above all, a story of personal redemption, and what struck me most about it was the heart, humor, honesty, and compassion with which Craig writes.”-- Jennifer M.
