  "description": "Let's get this clear right away: I'm a dog. I'm 1'10\" and weigh 63 lbs, and although I'm a mutt on the outside, I'm a purebred on the inside. My good nature comes from the Golden Retriever side of the family, while my stubbornness is clearly from my Chowchow bloodlines. I've got Rastafarian ears, a black tongue for licking, and paws that should be on a dog twice my size. I type 60 words a minute. My name is Bo, and this is my story.From shelter dog reject to beloved pet and popular doggie blogger, Bo Hoefinger's life has been anything but ordinary. Join this incorrigible canine as he welcomes us into his life, complete with his wacky \"parents,\" a constipated feline housemate, and chipmunk warfare.",
