  "title": "What Is This Thing Called Love?",
  "description": "What is this thing called love? What color is it and what shape? Is it sweet or savory? Is it big or small? Like a lot of kids, Emma would really like to know. The problem is: everyone Emma asks—Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Grandad—seems to have a different idea of what love is. Can love really be in a piece of cake or a game of football? It seems there's a lot more to this love thing than Emma ever imagined! In this entertaining and ultimately touching tale of questions and answers, Davide Cali and Anna Laura Cantone remind us that, for a child, the most important love is that which lies at the heart of your own family.",
