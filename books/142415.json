  "description": "When a baby is abandoned in Peter and Lily’s courtyard, the safe world they once knew is rocked to its core. Lily instantly falls in love with Nissa—a baby with a shock of red hair just like Lily. Peter finds the child’s menacing black eyes and uncanny resemblance to his wife unsettling. But Nissa’s appearance isn’t nearly as disturbing as her penchant for mind control and chaos. Clearly, Nissa is in charge and on a mission.",
