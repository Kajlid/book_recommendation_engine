But as Hastings guards the senator, he uncovers a much different story about Reese, one that isn't as cut-and-dried as Preston would like everyone to believe, one that would give a man like Reese plenty of reason to want revenge at any cost.As Hastings races to stop Reese, he quickly finds that he's not the only one hunting this most dangerous prey and that Reese isn't the only one caught in the crosshairs of politicians and professional killers in The Silent Places , another pulse-pounding read from James Patrick Hunt.",
