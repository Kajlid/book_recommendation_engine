Calamity Kid and e-girl undergo technological re-formation that provides them with skills, knowledge and other abilities that allow them meet the gravest challenges facing Fundamentalist Christians and ultimately help them save their family, friends and neighbors before they're brainwashed, enslaved or worse by the One-State Neros.",
