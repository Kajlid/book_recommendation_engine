The fact that Caleb isn't freaked out over Boyd's long-lost daughter, Ella, is more proof, to Boyd that they're meant to be together.

Between keeping the situation hidden at work, and avoiding his family, it's stressful. Helping Boyd's daughter is not only the right thing to do, it's a great distraction. When Ella's nearly killed, Caleb steps forward to help the man he loves by taking over to care for her, adding yet another complication to their already shaky situation. But when Caleb's family decides to meddle, Boyd refuses to back down and will do whatever it takes to fight for his boy...and their happiness. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
