  "description": "Excerpt from Birdcraft: A Field Book of Two Hundred Song Game, and Water BirdsDo you want to know the birds and call them by their familiar names You may do so if you will, provided you have keen eyes and a pocket full of patience; patience is the salt of the bird-catching legend.The ï¬‚owers silently await your coming, from the wayside wild rose to the shy orchid entrenched in the depths of the cool bog, and you may examine and study them at your leisure. With the birds it is often only a luring call, a scrap of melody, and they are gone. Yet in spite of this you may have a bowing and even a speaking acquaintance with them.",
