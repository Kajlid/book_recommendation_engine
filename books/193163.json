  "description": "The love of Amelia’s life is dead…but is Ty really gone forever?  After Ty bled out in Amelia’s arms, the disappearance of his body sparked an unlikely union between mortal enemies to uncover what happened and if the lycan-hybrid is still alive—even though alive no longer has the same definition.  The Royal Vampire Council will take all necessary measures to protect Amelia, their vampire Oracle. The blooded daughter of a traitor, she is forced into seclusion from the human world to the Armaya—the vampires’ hidden Alaskan complex where even those in power have a hierarchy to answer to. The threat of the damned is escalating, and no royal is safe from the growing danger.  With her loyal best friend, Kendrick, at her side, Amelia will commit any act to uncover the story behind Ty’s disappearance. The only chance Amelia has to save her lost love is by learning to control her secret abilities—abilities gained through the engineered blood in Amelia's veins. But as her chances of finding Ty alive dwindle, her feelings for Kendrick begin to grow.  \nPowers, obligation, budding love, and lost love. There are battles to be won, but is the life Amelia’s fighting for already six-feet under?\n  Other books in the Blood Bound Series What Lies Inside, Blood Bound Series Book 1 - http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DJLO9P4/ Made By Design, Blood Bound Series Book 2 - http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M8UFLL8  Warning - This book contains some language and sexual situations.
