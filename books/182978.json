  "description": "You may call it a dream job . . . And in some ways, you'd be right. I actually get paid to study people's dreams. It comes much easier than my employers at the Sleep Center suspect; after all, I, Dawn, am the daughter of the king of the dream world, and I can roam the dreams of others, battling the nightmares that plague them. I call it a nightmare . . . Honestly, I could use a good night's sleep. But ever since I met Noah Clarke, I'm even more torn between the two smart, sexy, and able to control his own dreams, Noah could be my perfect manâ€”except he's being stalked in his sleep by an unearthly evil, hell-bent on destroying him . . . and the entire world.",
