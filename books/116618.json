  "description": "With her severe good looks and chilly demeanor, some people think Greta Steele must be a witch, or a vampire, or the evil queen from a fairy tale. But she’s really the owner of Steele Kisses, one of the world’s largest retailers of lingerie and sex toys. Besides being a rich, powerful businesswoman, Greta also has a passion for human psychology…one nearly as deep as her fondness for sexuality. To explore these two combined elements, Greta has invented a most unusual game. It’s based on the popular pastime Would You Rather, but instead of merely answering questions like \"Would you rather shave your head or get a tattoo on your face?\", the participants in Greta’s Game must go through with the actual dares. These sexy challenges range from spankings and public nudity to performing acts with Greta’s sex toys…or other players…or even complete strangers. When Greta convinces four neighborhood women to play her game, the young lovelies have no idea what they’re in for. They’re soon naked and humiliated—some at the hands of their friends, and some at the hands of their enemies. But then the tables are turned as Greta herself is forced to choose between two disgraceful punishments.",
