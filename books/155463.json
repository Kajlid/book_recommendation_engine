  "description": "The year is 1818, the city is London, and our heroine, 16-year-old Annis Whitworth, has just learned that her father is dead and all his money is missing. And so, of course, she decides to become a spy.Annis always suspected that her father was a spy, so following in his footsteps to unmask his killer makes perfect sense. Alas, it does not make sense to England’s current spymasters—not even when Annis reveals that she has the rare magical ability to sew glamours: garments that can disguise the wearer completely.Well, if the spies are too pigheaded to take on a young woman of quality, then Annis will take them on.She’ll follow the clues her father left behind and discover what befell him.She’ll prove she can sew an impenetrable disguise.She’ll earn a living without stooping to become a—shudder—governess.It can’t be any harder than navigating the London social season, can it?",
