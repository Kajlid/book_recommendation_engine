  "description": "When sixteen-year-old BROOKE BERLIN catches a taste of fame and her movie-star father's attention, she decides it's time to take her career to the next level - by launching a blog that will position her as a Hollywood \"It Girl\" who tells it like it is. But between schoolwork, shopping, and spray-tan appointments, she hardly has the time to write it herself...Enter green-haired outsider MAX McCORMACK, an aspiring author with a terrible after-school job pushing faux meat on the macrobiotic masses. Max loathes the celebrity scene almost as much as she dislikes Brooke, but wooed by an impressive salary, Max reluctantly agrees to play Brooke's ghost-blogger - and the site takes off. How long will their lie last? Can the girls work together to stay on top, or will the truth come out and ruin everything they've built?Along with an entourage of fame-hungry starlets, scruffy rocker wannabes, and sushi-scarfing socialites, the cast of Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan's dazzling debut, Spoiled, are back for another adventure in Tinseltown.",
