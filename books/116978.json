  "description": "Hearts melt and emotions sizzle when the Queen of Cakes meets the King of Burgers and Fries. Lily Peradou’s life is as sweet as a piece of her best chocolate cake. Her pastries sell off the shelf and her shop is a success. When her chocolate cherry cordial cakes are accused of having undue influence in the decision making of the late dress designer, Sally James, Lily’s plans to expand into the vacant shop next door start to crumble. Her chocolate pot bubbles over when she meets the mouth-watering Noah Adler, the owner of the new restaurant on the other side of the empty dress shop between them. He’s smart and deliciously sexy in his cowboy boots and chef jacket. He’s also full of secrets about his past and evasive about his interest in the vacant store. Even worse, can she trust a chef who doesn’t have dessert on the menu? A career change and opening a gourmet burger place help Noah get his life in order. But when he runs into the zesty pastry chef in the alley behind their businesses, his life gets complicated. Determined to secure her future, Lily must defend her cakes and convince Noah that dessert can be tasty when you have someone to share it with.",
