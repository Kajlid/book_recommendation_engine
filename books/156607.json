  "title": "Horses: Photographs",
  "description": "More than a hundred extraordinary portraits—lush, rich, textured, sculptural—that reveal the spirit and nobility of the horse. Portraits of horses gazing at the camera, standing in the golden light, stamping away flies, galloping, bucking, rolling in the dust.They are the work of Michael Eastman, a self-taught photographer influenced by Edward Weston, Walker Evans, and Henry Moore, who spent thirty years capturing the essential nature of subjects that range from Cuban life to landscapes to architecture in many places. Now he turns his refined eye to the magnificent horse.Eastman has caught the animal’s complexity and power, fear and courage, goodness, masculinity, femininity, uniqueness.“All animals are wonderful,” says Eastman, “but horses are truly mythic.”",
