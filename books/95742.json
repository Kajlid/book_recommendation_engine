  "description": "After an airborne virus wipes out over half of the world's population, a group of strangers take shelter inside WTIX, a TV station just outside of Indianapolis. Two alpha males, Kurt and Jack, quickly take charge of the group, but problems arise when the two can't get along. As food and water run low, several people get sick, but the group worries it is because of the virus looming outside. The group begins to break from within and is torn between siding with Jack or Kurt. When they finally decide to break isolation and head to the hospital, they learn that the contaminated air may be the least of their problems. The biggest threat they have to deal with is themselves and they realize that it is never good to finish Dead Last.",
