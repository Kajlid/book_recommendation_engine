But as she encounters the people who make Last Chance their home, it’s her heart that is flashing bright red warning lights.

Or will the past catch up to her even here in the middle of nowhere?Cathleen Armstrong pens a debut novel filled with complex, lovable characters making their way through life and relationships the best they can.
