  "description": "When she looks into her own eyes, she sees a ghost. And when she looks into his eyes, she knows she has seen them before ... Danielle Grayson is a beautiful, intelligent young woman in present-day Georgia, but when she closes her eyes, she becomes someone else in a different time, one hundred years earlier in fact. Danielle's other life is as entrancing and romantic as her current one, and the contrast between the lifestyles is intriguing and enlightening, but what starts out as being dreamlike soon becomes real and strangely familiar. Worse, whatever happens to her as Danielle seems to change the past, if it is a true past. And when she finds she is not alone in being able to flip between the two worlds, life, love and death become increasingly disturbing.",
