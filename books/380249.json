  "description": "Since Raggedy Andy first appeared in print in 1920, he has delighted millions of readers with his adventurous spirit and compassionate nature. Now he returns to captivate a new generation in this carefully produced reissue, which restores the book to its original appearance. All the original stories are here, as Raggedy Andy arrives in the mail at Marcella's father's office, displays his cheery smile, and is eagerly reunited with his sister, Raggedy Ann. After a warm welcome from the other dolls, Raggedy Andy adds to their fun with a dance, a pillow fight, and a taffy pull. His merry escapades frequently show his generosity in helping others, as he bravely ventures into the gutter to find the penny dolls, \"cures\" the French doll, and encourages the wooden horse. Other stories also include Raggedy Andy and the other dolls' encounters with the Easter bunny, Santa Claus, and a beautiful seashell. Johnny Gruelle's delicate illustrations are the perfect companion to the well-loved stories in this American classic, the only edition authorized by the Gruelle family. A brief biography of the author-artist by his grandson, Kim Gruelle, makes this edition especially valuable.",
