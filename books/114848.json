  "title": "Epictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life",
  "description": "The philosophy of Epictetus, a freed slave in the Roman Empire, has been profoundly influential on Western thought: it offers not only stimulating ideas but practical guidance in living one's life. A. A. Long, a leading scholar of later ancient philosophy, gives the definitive presentation of the thought of Epictetus for a broad readership. Long's fresh and vivid translations of a selection of the best of Epictetus' discourses show that his ideas are as valuable and striking today as they were almost two thousand years ago.  This is a book for anyone interested in what we can learn from ancient philosophy about how to live our lives.",
