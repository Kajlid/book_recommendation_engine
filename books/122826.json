  "description": "Ever since high school, Cal Hewitt and Eric Hamilton have had a thing for each other. But they are so different, so opposite, neither has had the nerve to do anything about it. Over more than a decade spanning the late 1980s and the 1990s, life's greatest challenges, victories, and tragedies keep them from ever truly connecting or, alternately, losing touch. When two men are this perfect for each other, however, nothing is going to keep them apart-if they can only stop hating each other long enough to figure that out.",
