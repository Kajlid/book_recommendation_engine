  "title": "Foxe Den",
  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN: B00AL1B9OY.FOXE DEN follows Skyler Foxe and his friends through the holidays, from Thanksgiving to New Year’s, in this collection of short stories. Along the way, Skyler gets to inflict his mother on his boyfriend Keith, meets Keith’s parents, and just generally tries to navigate the treacherous waters of a brand new relationship. Unlike the novels, this novella hasn’t any mystery to solve. It’s the sort of stuff that happens between characters once the book cover is closed; a gift of “DVD extras.”",
