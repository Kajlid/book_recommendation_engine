  "description": "Rachel Cunningham is a recently divorced woman living in Texas. However, when a chance encounter with an old college friend and brief lover’s mother leads to a rekindled friendship, Rachel immediately finds all of her old feelings rushing to the surface. With more than twenty years and two failed marriages between her and Luke Sterling, can they overcome the distance and adversity and restore their past friendship and possibly more? Furthermore, can Rachel conquer her insecurities and learn to trust Luke again? Because after all, he left her once and she can’t seem to get the question of whether or not he will leave her again out of her mind. Touching on topics such as self-image, disability, trust, and social class, Walk on Water is a romantic novel that forgoes the traditional and stereotypical structures and settings. With a mature protagonist who has deep-seated insecurities and her recently disabled love interest, the novel broaches the subject of love and how it can overcome life’s adversities. Between Luke’s disability and elitist mother, and Rachel’s inability to trust him or herself, their love proves to be a struggle that may not have the happy ending that Rachel so desperately wants.",
