  "description": "Reporter Paige Ellis and billionaire Tom Rowe are bound to cross paths at the economic summit on the island of Beau Mer. But the sparks flying between them are off the charts. And then there's the body that washes ashore, forcing them to work together to catch a killer who's turned his sights on Tom. As a member of the all-female Medusa squad, Paige is put into service as Tom's temporary bodyguard. Apparently the U.S. government finds his body as important as she does enticing...and infuriating. But Tom, whose Special Forces past hides just beneath his expensive suits, will prove to be the Medusa's equal under fire...and irresistible at close range.",
