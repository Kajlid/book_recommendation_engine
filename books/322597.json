  "description": "She s got him right where he wants her.Dominion sentinel Kaela Garrett will go to any lengths to gather evidence against a suspected traitor, even if it means auctioning off her body to the highest bidder. Posing as a slave should have been the perfect cover to gain access to an exclusive gala. Only she hadn t anticipated a sexy treasure salvager with a grudge outbidding everyone including her mark to possess her. Lorcan Hunt can t believe the very sentinel who had him arrested six weeks ago is on the auction block, completely at his mercy. What better way to get even and pass the time until his next job than force her to submit to every new and wicked revenge he can imagine? His every demand for her submission, however, comes with a price: a burning need that slides under his skin and grows stronger with every concession she makes. When Kaela finally gives in to the fierce desire between them, Lorcan finds himself hopelessly caught in an impossible choice. Honor the commitment binding him to his next job or hold onto the one woman he can never have.\"",
