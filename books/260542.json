  "description": "Robert B. Parker's legendary Spenser series has long been considered the 'ne plus ultra' of detective fiction. But the critics' praise for Jesse Stone's debut in 'Night Passage' proved there was room for an addition to the Parker literary canon. \"A novel as fresh as it is bold. Parker's sentences flow with as much wit, grace, and assurance as ever, and Stone is a complex and consistently interesting new protagonist. His speedy return will be welcome\" (Newsday).Let's look into number two, 'Trouble in Paradise.' Stiles Island is a wealthy and exclusive enclave separated by a bridge from the Massachusetts coastal town of Paradise. James Macklin sees Stiles as the ultimate investment; all he needs to do is invade the island, blow up the bridge, and loot the place. Macklin, along with his devoted girlfriend, Faye, assembles a crew of fellow ex-cons--all experts in their fields--including Wilson Cromartie, a fearsome Apache. If Macklin is a very bad man, Crow is even worse. As Macklin prepares, Paradise Police Chief Stone has his hands full. He faces romantic entanglements in triplicate: his ex-wife, Jenn, is in his jail for assault; he's begun a new relationship with a Stiles Island realtor named Marcy Campbell; and he's still sorting out his feelings for attorney Abby Taylor. With Macklin's attack on Stiles Island, both Marcy and Abby are in jeopardy. As the casualties mount, it's up to Jesse to keep Paradise, and both women, from harm.The 'Boston Globe' hit the mark when it said, the novel is filled with \"light, shade, texture, and complexity.\"",
