  "description": "The Murdock Sisters are close, unique, and beautiful. These are the only traits they share in common. Their lives are turned upside down after the sudden death of their parents. The tragedy leaves them fragile and wounded, each trying to make sense of their lives. Their only unified decision was to make a fresh start in a new city. Camille Murdock is a mild-mannered owner of a coffee house cafe. Bianca Murdock, wounded in love, is a pseudo-militant civil rights activist who free-lances as a journalist. The Murdock Sisters are forced to face their differences in life and love when Camille meets and falls for the handsome, up and coming executive, Preston Warner Hughes. Surprises and drama surface when Bianca, while following a lead, uncovers a plot which could destroy Preston, his career, and ultimately her sister Camille. This discovery may also put Bianca on a path towards love. The lines of sisterhood are drawn and tested between healing, romance and hate. Which one will prevail?",
