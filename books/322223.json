And those other fish? They bite. Except these \"fish\" are small(ish), furry, and they're just the minions.On top of that, for the first time ever, Meg's met a hero who isn't afraid of her, and that's going to be a problem. Because Meg doesn't need some bad-boy biker hero type in her life, mucking up the one good thing she's got going.Villains, and monsters, and cops, oh my!Shit's about to get real.",
