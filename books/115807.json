  "description": "From the author of 'Drunk in Charge of a Foreign Language (The Diary of a Spanish Misadventure)'. 'The Electric Guitar Daydream Quest' takes us on another alcohol fuelled rollercoaster ride through the life of a perennial daydreamer.Follow the twenty year quest as Matt serves up a real ‘How-Not-To Guide’ for anyone who has ever dreamed of strapping on an electric guitar and going in search of the perfect riff, groupie filled parties and rock ‘n’ roll immortality.The quest takes us from his humble beginnings awkwardly strumming folk songs on a battered acoustic guitar, through to awkwardly belting out rock anthems on a battered electric guitar, before graduating to performing with a half decent electric guitar in numerous bands across a multitude of genres and then finally finding a brief five (not quite fifteen) minutes of fame in the early 1990’s as the singer-guitarist of an indie rock band.Are you ready to rock?",
