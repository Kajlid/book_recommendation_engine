  "title": "Mōtītī Blue and the Oil Spill: A Story from the Rena Disaster",
  "description": "On 5 October 2011 a large container ship grounded on a reef off the coast of the Bay of Plenty, spilling an estimated 350 tonnes of heavy fuel oil into the ocean. The impact was devastating, not only for the people of the area, but for the many thousands of birds and sea creatures who were covered in the toxic oil. One of these oiled birds, a little blue penguin we’ve named Motiti Blue, was rescued and treated at the Te Maunga Oiled Wildlife Response Centre. This is the story of his recovery and release. Written in both English and Maori, this bilingual book includes colour photographs, fact boxes, maps, graphics and a timeline.",
