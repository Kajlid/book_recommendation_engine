  "description": "Halloween is terrifying for monster hunters. The days after are worse. For Sarah and the Roosevelt Society, destroying a batch of zombies is par for the course. But the cause of such a sudden manifestation points to a horror no one dreamed of. A family of powerful spirits has invaded Denver. Worshipped as gods by some, and feared by others, they are a force of nature that brings chaos wherever they go. Their presence brings more magical power to the city than anyone has ever seenâ€¦and with it the monsters that feed on it. Sarah and RoSo have their hands full. But wayward spirits are the least of their worries. One man foresaw the coming of this family of spirits. With the help of primitive magic, a holy relic that slew a messiah, and a literal monster from under the bed, he will siphon raw power from these chaotic beings and transform himself into a god. All it will cost is the death of a city. Stopping such power may well be impossible. The only hope is a young woman who hears a voice that speaks of the future. But that alone won't be enough. For the future that voice speaks of isn't pretty, and the spirits are closing in. Sequel to Hole in the Heart, The Voice As I Hear It is an urban fantasy adventure.",
