  "description": "The daughter of a literary feminist who follows a cult leader...A Baptist Christian film-maker who struggles with AIDS...A computer wizard who designs the escapes into an alternate universe...The son of a fast food magnate who burns down the city...areTHE NOTHINGSFour university graduates decide to play a sociological game - for a year. After stripping themselves of all identity, financial resources, family ties and education...in short, of all history, Boyd, Moses, Lot and Eliza vanish into the city in what they call Urban Carnage. With only $10 and the clothes on their backs, they must survive the city for one year and report back on what they learned. Set before a fractured landscape of the O.J. Simpson trial on CNN, Toronto is the stage of this urban tale of generational warfare. Will what they learn - murder, sex, the power of money, media lies - in the darkest corners of urban life prepare them to inherit the earth destroyed by their parents? Do \"THE NOTHINGS\" have something to teach Baby Boomers?",
