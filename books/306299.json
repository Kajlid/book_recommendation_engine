  "description": "I’m a city girl—born and raised. A towering high-rise that overlooks the hustle and bustle is where my future should lead. Living in farm country? That possibility never had a place on my bucket list. Until now.Bumping into Reeve Colton—local bachelor and shameless flirt—on my introductory stroll down Main Street is a pleasant surprise. The small-town charm of Bampton Valley begins sinking in that afternoon. Maybe this temporary relocation is a blessing in disguise.What starts as a bit of fun becomes complicated in a hurry. It turns out Reeve and I have more in common than our mutual appreciation for good barbecue.But that won’t change the inevitable.When my contract is done, I’ll be leaving him—and Bampton Valley—behind.Expected to release February 25, 2021.",
