  "description": "Rolly Smalls is on a mission to get himself retired. After 125 years in the same job who can blame him? He has to work to earn EverLife, the biological elixir that gives immortality, while looking forward to an idyllic retirement: absolute freedom for the rest of his very long life. Only a handful of people retire each year and Rolly is on the verge, but his number is too low. He’s not there, but it’s so close, so tantalizingly close, just a few dollars out of reach... Under pressure from his impatient wife, with an estranged son who could solve all his problems, Rolly pushes hard and risks everything to achieve the one thing everybody wants. A goal more difficult than he realizes because Rolly Smalls - reliable employee and upstanding citizen - has a secret that could end all his hopes, a secret even he doesn’t know exists.",
