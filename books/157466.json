  "description": "As a combat hardened Navy SEAL Thom Grande has fought terrorism around the globe, but the one thing he can’t fight is his ex-wife. Or her lawyer. Or the alimony payments. Just when he thinks it can’t get any worse bad luck smacks him up side the head—literally. Now, he’s got a traumatic brain injury and can’t remember his own name half the time. The good news? He can’t remember his ex-wife or the woes she’s causing him either.  Virginia is alone, partially by choice because too much time spent around her mother drives her crazy, and partially because she has the worst luck ever with romance. But maybe her luck is changing because one hell of a hot and very naked man just showed up at her door. One problem—he can’t remember anything, including who he is. The more she sees, the more she realizes, that might not matter all that much.  Don’t miss Night with a SEAL, Saved by a SEAL, and Kissed by a SEAL for Jon, Zane and Chris’s stories in the Hot SEALs series from New York Times and USA Today bestseller Cat Johnson.
