  "description": "Rai Jones, a 25-year-old virgin, has never really seen the ocean, shot a gun, or made love to three Elven maidens at the same time... but he lives in a world where technology and drugs make all things possible. Powered by computers, his life is one big virtual fantasy in which Rai can do whatever he wants to do and be whoever he wants to be. Yet in reality, he's merely average, trapped in a mundane job with no prospects for finding real satisfaction, and caught in the tension between his fantasy life and real life. Enter Winry: practically perfect, stunningly beautiful, intelligent, and witty. It's love at first sight with the aid of Love Pills (drugs that replicate the feeling of being in love) and as Rai begins to capture her imagination, the real Winry remains shrouded in mystery, hidden behind the curtain of cyberspace, and scared to have a real relationship. Swept up in a whirlwind of Love, fake violence, and virtual fantasies, Rai and Winry set out to find the secret to modern life and romance... There is no secret, seriously, learn to think for yourself.",
