  "description": "The dimensions of this mythic feminist imagination can be savored to the full in this first full-scale collection of the author's short fiction.Ever since the first publication of her stories in the late 1930s, with collages by Max Ernst, and over the decades in various small magazines and among small presses in all parts of the world, a small cultish group of fervent admirers has been tracking her work, which she herself, moving from continent and writing in three different languages, has never attempted to promote. Now, as John Russell has stated about her graphic achievements, she is \"An artist whose name will live in the history of twentieth-century art.\"The Seventh Horse includes such classics as \"White Rabbits,\" \"The Neutral Man,\" and a story version of \"The Stone Door;\" various tales published in Mexican literary magazines, or previously unpublished, and many early French stories discovered among the papers of Max Ernst after his death.",
