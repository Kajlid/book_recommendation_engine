  "description": "From Ashes to Ashes, and dusk to dusk, there are those that Cocoon themselves in the Little Lies they tell.  When the Wreckage keeps them Awake at night, they see the Sickness In The Sunrise. They Ignite everything in their path.  When their minds run through the Unbearable and Forbidden Sorrows. Until one day they find the thing that keeps them Grounded.  All while others feel the Hostile Takeover of their lives. The constant Loops and The Rows of Tattered Pieces and fragments that plague them. Sometimes those canâ€™t be Purged driving them to the edge of madness.  *This is an anthology covering topics of mental illness and disorders. There will be triggers.*  **All proceeds benefit To Write Love On Her Arms (TWLOHA) a non-profit movement dedicated to presenting hope and finding help for people struggling with depression, addiction, self-injury, and suicide. TWLOHA exists to encourage, inform, inspire, and also to invest directly into treatment and recovery.**",
