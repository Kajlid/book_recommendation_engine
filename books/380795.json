  "description": "Learn to read with the classic Amelia Bedelia! Ever since Amelia Bedelia made her debut in 1963, young readers have been laughing out loud at the antics of this literal-minded but charming housekeeper.  From dressing the chicken to drawing the drapes, Amelia Bedelia merrily does exactly what Mr. and Mrs. Rogers tell her to do. But even when things get a bit mixed up in the process, Amelia Bedelia always finds a way to make everything turn out perfectly in the end. Peggy Parish's beloved classic is a Level Two I Can Read book, geared for kids who read on their own but still need a little help. Through Amelia Bedelia's hilarious adventures, kids learn the difference between literal and nonliteral language and begin to grasp wordplay. Whether shared at home or in a classroom, the engaging stories, longer sentences, and language play of Level Two books are proven to help kids take their next steps toward reading success.",
