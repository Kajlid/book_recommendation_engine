  "description": "God Bless The Dead  \"The truth will not set you free. The truth will get you killed.”  -Screamin’ Jay Hawkins Gabriel Sheehan is in the truth business. He has invented a practical mind reading technology. But his wife, Helena, is no friend of the truth. Gabriel knew she was something of an enigma when he married her, but occasionally she seems more catatonic than enigmatic. And he definitely has the impression that she may have killed someone, though he’s not quite sure of the details. While his company is a success, the change his technology works upon society attracts the attention of powerful forces, both in and outside of the kind of forces that his wife has carefully been hiding from for her entire life. But now she can’t hide anymore. And those forces are intent on using his new technology in ways that Gabriel had never anticipated—in ways that may lead to his wife’s final disappearance.  God Bless the Dead  follows the lives of Gabriel, a failing grad student in Biophysics, and his wife, Helena. Helena is a brilliant, troubled, red-headed Irish émigré, the victim of abuse in a Sisters of Mercy orphanage. Based upon the most recent research in the field,  God Bless the Dead  presents a prescient and realistic look at our society in the immediate future, when secrets no longer exist and justice is defined by technology. It is a love story and a story of overcoming one’s past, an exploration of the nature of mental illness and, ultimately, an uplifting examination of what makes our thoughts manifest and our lives meaningful. All proceeds from each book sold are donated to research seeking improved care for mental illness.",
