  "description": "\"For every action there is an equal or opposite reaction.\"For every choice you make there are rewards, or there are consequences.It was my choice to walk away the first time.And my choice to chase her the second.But sometimes you don't get a choice, and all you get are the consequences.\"Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.”Unless that someone is Logan Matthews. Because loving him didn't give me the strength to walk away.It didn't give me the courage to fight for him.And when it was over, all it gave me was a broken heart.",
