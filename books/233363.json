  "title": "Eve out of Her Ruins",
  "description": "With brutal honesty and poetic urgency, Ananda Devi relates the tale of four young Mauritians trapped in their country's endless cycle of fear and violence: Eve, whose body is her only weapon and source of power; Savita, Eve's best friend, the only one who loves Eve without self-interest, who has plans to leave but will not go alone; Saadiq, gifted would-be poet, inspired by Rimbaud, in love with Eve; Clelio, belligerent rebel, waiting without hope for his brother to send for him from France.  Eve out of Her Ruins is a heartbreaking look at the dark corners of the island nation of Mauritius that tourists never see, and a poignant exploration of lives at the margins of society.  Published in the UK for the first time, this celebrated novel won the 2006 Prix des cinq continents de la Francophonie. With an original introduction by Nobel Prize winner Jean Marie G. Le Clezio, who declares Devi \"a truly great writer.\"",
