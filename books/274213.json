  "description": "In earth's provincial culture after the interstellar war women were to marry young, bear sons, and obey their husbands, but Ellia Kellzi was tough, smart, and fast â€“ and nobody was going to stand between her and independence. At the stone coast she learned to ride like the wind and fight like a man. In the great open city she won the trust of two of the People, wolf-like humanoids from a land across the sea. And in the dreaded blasted hills, she faced madness, terror, and even death to learn the most terrible secret of the Island.",
