  "description": "The Box Of Mirrors is a short, surreal comedy novel about the time that Sebastian England found that he was held against his will inside his own head. The story follows the actions of the various departments and workers inside Sebastian's head as they scramble to save their town from the cataclysm that is about to be unleashed.In a broken, disjointed, often badly informed manner, people like Courier, Archivist and The Agent do their utmost to avert the coming disaster, but their efforts are hampered by the minions of Despair. Will Sebastian figure out just why he's stuck in his own mind before the town's lights go out forever, or, will his crushing ineptitude see him still clueless even as the axe falls?The Box Of Mirrors, written in 2004-2005, was the last novel that Michael Pugh wrote before his brain injury and so it reads very differently to his more recent books.This ebook contains swearing and scenes of a violent nature and so is not suitable for children.Brief background: The Box Of Mirrors is about mental illness and emotional difficulty. It’s a story about what happens to you when you try to hide from the hard things and hope that just by hiding, you’ll get away with it. I wrote it when I was myself going through some very dark times and so the book reads very differently to my usual work. The Box Of Mirrors was written between 2004 and 2008 and took longer than any of my other projects to complete.",
