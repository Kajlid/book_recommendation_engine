  "description": "'Smart, sexy, and oh-so-romantic' Mary Balogh\nFor Miss Charlotte Windham, the best way to maintain her spinsterhood - and her independence - is a teeny, tiny brush with scandal. She chooses wealthy, handsome upstart Lucas Sherbourne as her unwitting accomplice. He's intelligent, logical, and ambitious. What Charlotte doesn't count on is that one kiss will lead them straight to the altar.Sherbourne has no love for polite society, nor is he keen on being anybody's husband of last resort. He is attracted to Charlotte's boldness, though - and her family's influence. Without a title, he knows he'll never truly be part of their world, even as he and Charlotte inch closer to a marriage that means much more than convenience. But a scheming business partner is about to test that tenuous trust, forcing Sherbourne to make a drastic choice: his wealth or his wife.\nThe sparkling fourth book in the New York Times bestselling Windham Brides series - perfect for fans of Eloisa James, Tessa Dare and Elizabeth Hoyt\n\nThe Windham Brides series:\n\nThe Trouble with Dukes\n\nToo Scot to Handle\n\nNo Other Duke Will Do\n\nA Rogue of Her Own\n\nPraise for Grace Burrowes: \n'Wonderfully funny, moving romance, not to be missed!'
