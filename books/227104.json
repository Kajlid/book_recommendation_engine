  "title": "Abnormal Psychology in Context: The Australian and New Zealand Handbook",
  "description": "Abnormal Psychology in Context is a practical and contemporary handbook for both students of abnormal psychology and allied mental health practitioners. This text is one of the first of its kind, providing a specific focus on abnormal psychology from Australian and New Zealand - rather than US - perspectives. Nadine Pelling and Lorelle Burton have crafted a highly relevant resource, showcasing the most recent Australasian research in a clear format designed for ease of use. Written by leading researchers from Australia and New Zealand, each chapter examines a particular psychological disorder, details symptoms and responses, and includes relevant statistics, case studies, further reading and links to community resources. The chapters give equal weight to Australian and New Zealand experiences in abnormal psychology matters. Succinctly written yet richly detailed, Abnormal Psychology in Context is an essential resource that students can carry from the classroom into the workplace.",
