  "title": "United Artists: Poems",
  "description": "A bold, new poet's vision of transformative, exuberant art, United Artists celebrates the primacy of imagination in the life well-lived. This beguiling first collection of poems by S. X. Rosenstock is an art lover's dream as well as a passionate, timely defense of the arts. With remarkable verve and grace, Rosenstock moves among the monuments and the ruins of society in comic, compassionate verses that challenge patriarchal codes and reveal authentic modes of pleasures. In fresh and provocative fashion, Rosenstock offers readers breathtakingly original encounters with the likes of Charles Baudelaire, Aubrey Beardsley, Fernando Botero, Francisco Goya, Lana Turner, Edith Wharton, John Woo, Madame Bovary's daughter, Petit Marcel's mother, and a host of others.",
