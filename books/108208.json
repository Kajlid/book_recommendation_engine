  "description": "Skyler Daratrazanoff always recognized the miracle that was Dimitri Tirunul, a man beyond any dream that had ever engaged her nights. But she is human. Vulnerable. He is Carpathian. Nearly immortal. She is nineteen. He is an ancient. Yet she holds half his soul, the light to his darkness. Without her, he will not survive.Caught between the two warring species, Dimitri has spent centuries hunting the undead to keep his people free and humans safe. He has survived honorably when others have chosen to give up their souls. Now, marked for extermination by the Lycans, Dimitri finds himself alone, and fearing for his life. But salvation is coming...No Lycan would ever suspect someone like Skyler to dare mount a secret rescue operation. A teenage girl. A human of untested abilities. But she has something no one else does. She is predestined for Dimitriâ€”as he is for her. And there is nothing stronger for Skyler than her desire to see her life-dream come true. Whatever the risk.",
