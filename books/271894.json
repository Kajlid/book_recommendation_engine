He lives and breathes his job providing library access to the rural towns south of Grayson City. But every weekend he heads to the bar in search of another alpha to go home with. If he preps himself beforehand, they never have to know his secret: Simon can't slick.Omegas who can't slick can't have children either, and alphas aren't accepting of that. At twenty seven, Simon's learned that relationships simply aren't worth the risk. It's better to focus on his job as a bookmobile librarian, and stop dreaming about the mate he's never going to have.Art Hitchens buried the love of his life five years ago. At forty five, he has no intention of chasing after omegas ever again. But when a bookmobile librarian shows up in his hometown and gives him a wild proposition, Art feels alive for the first time in years.Simon may be too young for Art and slow to trust after being rejected so many times, but Art feels a need to take care of Simon that's impossible to ignore.The Bookmobile Baby is a 48,000-word May/December romance with knotting, MPreg, BDSM, and a nurturing Dom. It's the second book in the Nerds Who Knot series, but it stands alone.",
