  "description": "How could a world so cruel and inhumane exist?Little did I know the one-time-job I’d taken would plunge me into a world filled with mob ties and illegal activities or bring me face to face with the woman of my dreams. Isla Chambers was a blinding vision wrapped in Kevlar and topped in a baseball cap with FBI stitched on it.With the sexy Isla working by my side, I gladly offered my assistance as the FBI’s only tether in uncovering this operation.Besides, this could launch my career even further so refusing wasn’t an option.The risk seemed small … or so I thought.Not only did it expose Isla to danger, it also placed a huge target on my back.It wasn’t long before I was drowning in unimaginable darkness.How could a world so cruel and inhumane exist?Days and nights merged until I was nothing but broken fragments.The beautiful face that had brought me so much joy, was stolen from memory as I surrendered to the blackness now ruling my soul. That carefree, innocent young man was beaten out of existence. In his place, only an empty shell remained.Until the day Isla walked back into my crumbling reality. Was I too lost for that dream to live on?If she still wanted me, I knew one thing.I wasn’t worthy of her purity anymore.",
