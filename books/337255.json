  "description": "My name is Remi Mars, and I am not a thief.I’m a messenger at best. I just deliver the messages that people don’t want to hear. Owe someone money? I break your kneecaps. Double-cross one of my clients? I blow up your car. People listen to me. And if they don’t...? I have to handle it, whether I want to or not.Especially after the mistake I made that forced me into this school of rich pricks in the first place.But tarnished bad boys Luc and Nico don’t listen, too focused on getting revenge. And Key? He doesn’t listen to anyone.The problem is that my new classmates at Silvermoor don’t know me as anything but the charity foster-care freak, the headmistress has my balls in a vice, and Bossman Barker has added an extra zero to my fee. And you don’t f*ck with Bossman.So, again, I’m not a thief. I’m just trying to survive.Don’t shoot The Messenger.",
