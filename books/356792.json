  "title": "Christmas Is Dead: A Zombie Anthology",
  "description": "Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a...zombie? That's right; this anthology explores what would happen at Christmas time if there was a full blown zombie outbreak. Reanimated turkeys, zombie Santas, and demon reindeers that turn people to flesh-eating ghouls are just some of the tales you will find in this merry undead book. So curl up under the Christmas tree with a cup of hot chocolate, and as the fireplace crackles with warmth, get ready to have your heart filled with holiday cheer. But of course, then it will be ripped from your heaving chest and fed upon by blood-thirsty elves with a craving for human flesh! For you see, Christmas is Dead! And you will never look at the holiday season the same way again. Edited by Anthony Giangregorio With stories from Scott Baker, Rob Rosen, Rick Moore, Keith Luethke, Anthony Giangregorio, Peter Naggi, Tom Hamilton, Marc Wiggins, Lance Looper, Sean Grigsby, Kevin Cockle, Kelly Hudson, Paul Snider, Val Muller, Jack Burton and David Bernstein",
