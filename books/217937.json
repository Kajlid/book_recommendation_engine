  "title": "Keep It Good: Understanding Creation Care through Parables",
  "description": "What does God think of His creation? Does it make any difference to you and me? He gave creation to His children. It's ours to enjoy, and we're getting a new heaven and earth someday. So does it really make any difference how we treat his creation now? It’s an important question. Unfortunately the topic has been spoiled by polarized opinions, controversial science, and political agendas. If it really does make a difference in God's eyes, there must be a positive way to tell that story. And that's exactly what Keep It Good It tells the story through parables. Using stories about familial struggles and successes, teenage escapades, tragic mistakes, historical figures, and updated versions of literary pieces, Keep It Good will open your eyes to how Christians are missing the mark when it comes to God’s creation and provide practical suggestions for how to get there. After all, how would you want your children treating your creation?",
