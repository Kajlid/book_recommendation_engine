  "description": "Too Many Questions It wasn't that thirteen-year-old Conrad didn't like living with his aunt and uncle in St. Louis. It's just that his mother and father both lived in New York and he hadn't seen them lately. And he had a few questions he needed to have answered. That's how Conrad happened to spend the strangest week of his life in New York City with a girl he hardly knew--and getting more answers than he had questions...about his parents, himself, and what real families are all about. Conrad lives in St. Louis with his aunt and uncle, who his divorced parents feel can provide the stable home life they can't manage in New York City. When his mother decides that he should spend spring vacation in London instead of with her, Conrad is sure something is wrong, and he goes to New York to find out what. Once there he contacts Nancy, a secretive girl with a family life just as strange as Conrad's. With Nancy by his side, Conrad embarks on a remarkable adventure of discovery-about his family and about himself.",
