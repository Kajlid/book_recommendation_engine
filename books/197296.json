  "description": "From the author of the #1 bestselling Sherlock Academy series...In a land of fortune telling, alchemy, and magic carpet racing, Dodie Rue feels out of place. Catching rats to help his family scrape by, Dodie wishes he could be more like his brother, Taj, a favorite to win first place in the upcoming Grand Flyer. But Dodie doesn’t have the nerve or stomach for racing, a fact that the town bully Atallah won’t let him forget. The race is just a few days away when Taj is poisoned with the rare Death’s Kiss by an unknown opponent. When Dodie finds out that Taj only has seven days to live, he decides to race in Taj’s place. Armed with his grandfather’s famous magic carpet, a secret map, and a nausea potion from his friend Binni, Dodie is determined to win the first place prize: a wish from a genie and the only hope for his brother. But the desert is a treacherous place with ghouls, sandstorms, and dragons around every dune. In a race with no rules, the racers are as dangerous as the desert. Will Dodie be able to outsmart the other racers, save his family’s shop, and rescue his brother from the grip of death?",
