  "description": "Cruel and Careless is a new adult MM romance with an HEA, and can be read as a standalone. Please read the content warning before beginning as there are dark themes that may be triggering to some readers.BenWake up. Smoke. Get drunk. Sleep. Repeat. I’m about to start my senior year of high school, and I don’t see that cycle changing any time soon. I’ve spent most of my life just trying to make it one more day, a precarious war in my head—one I was barely winning. But then he forced his way in and showed me what I was missing. A boy I’ve always looked at a little bit too long. He’s no better than me, though— He’s barely hanging on.DamonI’m careless and I probably shouldn’t have gone out of my way to hook-up with a very pretty, very straight, boy. He wants more than I have to offer. He may not even realize it, but it’s written all over his face. His bright eyes drill into me in a desperate attempt to rip me apart and dive inside, but what he doesn’t know is that would be the worst decision of his life. I’m no one’s savior.",
