  "description": "Athena Spencer works with her big Greek-American family (whom she also anonymously blogs about) at their garden center near Lake Michigan. She's also gained a reputation for crime-solving--and that's what brings flower-shop owner and fellow sleuth Abby Knight Salvare to her door . . . Abby has come from Indiana to this Lake Michigan town to help her cousin, Jillian, who was emceeing a local fashion show and now stands accused of murdering one of the models. Some of Sequoia's most prominent citizens were there on the catwalk, so there's increasing pressure to have the next event be a perp walk.The clueless Jillian is in jail after ignoring orders not to leave town, and she isn't happy--orange is not her color. Along with her handsome PI partner, Case, Athena starts making inquiries, while tiptoeing around the wives of the town's mayor and police chief. In the meantime, the two detectives are becoming fast friends. After all, in addition to homicide, Abby and Athena share an interest in horticulture--though right now the only thing they're growing is their list of suspects . . .",
