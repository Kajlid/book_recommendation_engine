He wants justice for the girl. Justice for her grieving family.Is homicide the career change he’s been looking for?The trio makes a solid team, and their banter takes the edge off a serious case. Working alongside Aslan again is fantastic. They have found a balance that works, but for as comfortable as they have become as a couple, for as inevitable as their future together seems, something’s missing.Aslan is ready to take the next step in their relationship, but Quaid needs certain feelings to be disclosed first.Do actions speak louder than words? Or is there magic in saying I love you?** Inevitable Disclosure is the fourth book in the Valor and Doyle Mystery Series. It is a same-couple series that should be read in order. Although each book has a self-contained mystery with no cliff-hangers, the romance is overarching and progressive throughout the series. **",
