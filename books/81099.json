  "description": "\"I saw that everything going on was tied up in a knot that held this at its centerâ€”'I'm not what I wanted to be.' \"It's been ten years since Joshua Rivers had his dream of the girl he believes he is supposed to marry, and she's still nowhere in sight. Now twenty-two, Joshua is stuck in a life markedly different from what he expected: he's unhappy with his current girlfriend and struggling with his doctoral thesis, and making no headway toward becoming a novelist, as he believes he must to win over his dream girl. Worse, his long-time lover, the nymphomaniac artist Lilian Lau, has cut him off because she thinks he's become dependent on her.Little does Joshua know that by the end of the year he'll have met his destined love at last, but for now he is mired in darkness. Global terrorism and the lead-up to the Second Iraq War have created an climate of fear and anger in the intellectual world, and Joshua himself begins to manifest the ugly face of radicalism. Finally, two chance encounters will see him revisit his family's secrets, and give him a reprieve from his loneliness that he knows he does not deserve.My Generation's Lament is the sequel to Kiss Me, Genius Boy, and the second volume in the No More Dreams trilogy.",
