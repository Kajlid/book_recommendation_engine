  "description": "Librarian's Note: This is an alternate-cover edition for ISBN 9781311561978 What would you do if you were torn away from your home and family, chosen by lottery to become a public symbol of the defeat of your people? To be put on display by the victor as a symbol of his power? To enter a world of service - of domination and submission - of pleasure and punishment?When Liz Peltier becomes a mere pawn in an old political game, she must struggle to answer these questions for herself. She must reconcile her thoroughly modern self with the growing realization that her deepest fulfillment comes when she is on her knees. And when she finds that the people who are holding her may not actually be the enemy, she realizes it might just be possible for her to find happiness in the midst of tragedy.Should she fight her feelings, or choose to embrace them?Come follow Liz on her odyssey - from fear to love, and from heartache to home.*This book contains adult themes that not every reader will enjoy, including difficult situations that our heroine must overcome, lots of spankings, some anal sex, nice doses of consensual sexual service, and a really hot Master who doesn't always know a good thing even when it's right in front of him.",
