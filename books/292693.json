  "description": "Seven authors have teamed up to distort the most sacred of virtues. An anthology to test your limits, to make you squirm, and stories to take you outside of the box.Don't bless us Father, for we came to sin.Through acts of kindness, our diligence will shine in the darkest of hours. With our chastity held in highest regard like a prize to be won, and the patience needed to persevere through these trying times, our humility will guide the way. And when our hearts have finally learned the importance of temperance, will we give back all we can through charity.So it is written, so it shall be done.",
