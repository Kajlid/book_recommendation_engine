  "description": "I never imagined my new roommate would be the man I’d actually fall for. Though I don’t get close to the people I sleep with, he’s been my exception. Archer acts emotionally unavailable while he focuses on starting over, but our connection is too strong to ignore.He’s rugged on the outside and sweet on the inside—the opposite of my usual type. I see the way his eyes gaze up and down my body, making it harder to keep my feelings in check. Knocking down his walls is no easy task, especially with my brother interfering, but I refuse to give up.When lines are crossed and emotions bubble over, trouble finds us. We both have pasts that have leaked into our present—now I’m scared it’ll destroy the one secret we’ve been keeping.WANTING YOU CLOSE is book 2 in the Archer & Everleigh duet and must be read in order.",
