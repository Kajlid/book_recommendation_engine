  "description": "Steve \"Sneeze\" Wyatt is proud to be known for his fabulous inventions, but, unfortunately, they are also the reason his parents have decided that he should skip a grade and leave all of his friends behind in junior high! There’s no way the resourceful Sneeze is going to let that happen. He’s on a mission to think of 101 surefire ways to get under his teachers’ skin . . . and fast. And not even a worrisome case of inventor’s block, or fear of his history teacher Ms. \"Fierce\" Pierce, will deter him from his clever plan.",
