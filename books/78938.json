  "title": "Arrow of the Blue-Skinned God: Retracing the Ramayana Through India",
  "description": "The three-thousand-year-old epic Ramayana chronicles Lord Rama's physical voyage from one end of the Indian subcontinent to the other and his spiritual voyage from Man to God. In Arrow of the Blue-Skinned God, anthropologist and journalist Jonah Blank gives a new perspective to this Hindu classic -- retelling the ancient tale while following the course of Rama's journey through present-day India and Sri Lanka. Ultimately, Blank's journey -- like that of Lord Rama -- evolves into a quest: to understand the chimerical essence of India itself, in all its overwhelming beauty and paradox. \"Quite possibly the most perceptive book that I have come across on India since the British Raj ended.\" -- Pranay Gupte, The Washington Post\"What Hollywood attempted on the big screen with casts of thousands in Gandhi and A Passage to India, Jonah Blank has achieved in 350 stylistically rich pages.\" -- Los Angeles Times\"This informative and entertaining book is something to be thankful for.\" -- The New York Times Book Review",
