  "description": "Workaholic, Maeve Burgundy, avoids any relationship where she might fall in love. She's forced by her best friend to take a vacation she won to the exotic Sodom Resort. They specialize in turning any erotic fantasy into reality-Virtual Reality. What Maeve doesn't know is that Angel, the owner of the Resort and her old college boyfriend, has rigged the contest in an effort to reconnect with Maeve. He wants to persuade her to become part of a committed ménage à trois with his best friend and lover, Luke. The two men have to figure out how to pierce the thick armor around her heart and open her to their love. Maeve meets Angel-in disguise- during her first erotic fantasy in VR. They connect right away and Maeve promises to spend the rest of her fantasies with him, as long as he reveals who he is in real life at the end of her vacation. During her second fantasy, Luke joins them and Maeve realizes she isn't in danger of falling in love with one amazing man, but two. Luke warns Angel that they may lose Maeve because of his deception, but Angel will take any chance to win Maeve back and convince her how good a loving ménage à trois can be.",
