  "title": "The Rules: Time-Tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr. Right",
  "description": "You are a creature unlike any other (Rule #1)--that's why you need . . . The Rules. A simple set of dos and don'ts, The Rules will lead you to where you want to be: in a healthy, committed relationship. Unlike today's haphazard dating customs, The Rules recognizes certain facts of life. That men know what they want. That a man is either attracted to you--or not! That men want a challenge, not an instant or easy victory. When you follow these commonsense guidelines, you treat yourself with respect and dignity--and demand that men do likewise. Although they sound old-fashioned (\"Don't see him more than once or twice a week\"), they encourage you to lead a full, satisfying, busy life--outside of romance. Although they seem tough (\"Don't talk to a man first\"), they will teach you how to accept occasional defeat and move on. And although they require discipline (\"No more than casual kissing on the first date\"), they will bring out the best in you and in the men you date. The goal? Marriage, in the shortest time possible, to a man you love, who loves you even more than you love him.",
