  "title": "The Perks of Being a Wallflower: A BookCaps Study Guide",
  "description": "The perfect companion to Stephen Chbosky's \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\" this study guide contains a chapter by chapter analysis of the book, a summary of the plot, and a guide to major characters and themes. BookCap Study Guides do not contain text from the actual book, and are not meant to be purchased as alternatives to reading the book. We all need refreshers every now and then. Whether you are a student trying to cram for that big final, or someone just trying to understand a book more, BookCaps can help. We are a small, but growing company, and are adding titles every month.",
