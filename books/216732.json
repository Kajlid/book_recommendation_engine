  "description": "Thresh.  Just the name suggests power, dominance, danger...and the man himself? Oh man. I’ve never met anyone like him. Larger than life, exuding raw power. He’s a mountain of rugged, masculine sex appeal.  But I have walls that no man, no matter how big he is, has ever been able to break through. Thresh doesn’t know how to take “no” for an answer, though. He’s determined to get past all my defenses and show me what I’ve been missing.  The only problem is Thresh has enemies. Powerful, deadly, merciless enemies who have no problem using me to get to him. And Thresh is injured, one arm left useless.  Can Thresh singlehandedly take on armed and dangerous men out to kill us AND my freight train of emotional baggage?",
