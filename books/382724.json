  "description": "Dear reader. My name is Trevor Beron and I am not insane. Not long ago I was a lot like you. I worked my tail off with little reward, battled through the day-to-day grind, and escaped reality through books on the science-fiction shelf. Now, thanks to a series of events that began around the same time Columbus landed in the Bahamas, I am a permanent resident of the Bermuda Triangle. In this novel a memoir of my first week in the infamous Triangle I explain how I got here. In addition to telling you my story, I will share with you the truth about: Aliens, Ghosts, Werewolves, Big Foot, Crop circles, The crash at Roswell, The pyramids of Mars, Nostradamus, Guardian Angels, Pigeons, and more. This is not a scifi thriller. This is not even fiction. This is my life. After reading it you may consider joining me out here in the Bermuda Triangle, but you ll soon learn that locating the station is impossible. The aliens guarding it and the humans running it make damn sure of that! For you, this will simply have to be another escape. That is, unless your dad also had a secret past life he never shared with you.",
