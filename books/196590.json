  "description": "Natalie Vellacott worked in Sussex Police for almost a decade, during which time she investigated almost every type of crime from traffic offences, thefts and minor assaults to burglaries, rape and murder. These revealing and often humorous stories from the frontline of policing address the questions Natalie is most frequently asked as a former \"cop\": what is the worst incident you dealt with? the funniest? the craziest? the most serious? She also shares personal life experiences, showing how these impacted the way she dealt with issues that arose in police work. A fascinating read; hard to put down!",
