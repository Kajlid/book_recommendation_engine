  "description": "Mojag is in his early twenties, in the prime of seeking adulthood by being willingly torn from his home. Finding himself in a position of a wanderer, he soon realizes that being away from the warmth of his \"safehouse\" is not the only cause of his self-perceived misery, but his reluctance to a natural change in life. The mental evolution of his character is what he unconsciously aspires to achieve. That is his only objective goal. His girlfriend, his comfort, his friends, his family are vivid aids in his quest of life; the foreign land of his childhood dreams only his playground.Mojag's honesty is what makes readers find themselves in his actions, in his unbiased feelings, in his lust for life, in his quest for freedom, in his restless character. Neither a hero, nor a spineless cord, Mojag is someone that we all claim we are not. And Indifferent is a story so real that it can be touched.",
