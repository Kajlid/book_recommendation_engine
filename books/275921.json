  "description": "HE’S EVERYTHING I CAN’T HAVE… Noah Abrams is the epitome of tall, dark, and handsome. And he has the starring role in all of my fantasies. There’s just one problem—he’s my best friend’s father. I know I can never have him. But that won’t stop me from trying.  SHE’S EVERYTHING I’VE EVER WANTED… Nineteen-year-old Corrine Tate is the stuff wet dreams are made of—all luscious curves and soft contours. She’s a walking temptation, and I don’t know how much longer I can stay away, especially when she’s constantly flaunting her body, daring me to touch her.  ONE TASTE IS ALL IT TAKES… One late night, one innocent touch, one brush of her lips against mine… One fleeting moment of weakness is all it takes to break me. And now that I’ve had her, I’m not letting her go. But keeping her could cost me my daughter, my reputation, and my sanity.",
