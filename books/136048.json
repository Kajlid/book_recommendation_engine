Except for Josephine Harlow. From now on, Josie Harlow is living life full throttle. First task: find a nude model for her next photo series. Next up: getting rid of her pesky v-card. No more trying to gain her family's approval. They all think she's in love with her high school boyfriend. Instead she dreams of his brother, tattooed, mohawked mechanic Zachary Marshall. He annoys her and they fight constantly, but worst of all, he only sees her as \"Gabe's girl.\" Until Zack makes the most shocking offer of all, to be the model for her show. And the first man in her bed.",
