  "description": "Monogamy Songs is some kind of new beast. Maybe it's a memoir. Or a book of prose poems. Or maybe those \"poems\" are really mini-snapshots of true, horny, heartbroken, frustrated, medicated, nervous, passionate, jealous, sweaty domesticity. Sherl's language in this book is spiked and unguarded, sometimes in shocking ways. It's also breathtakingly beautiful. Monogamy Songs is the most personal book so far by this exciting young writer.\"Being in love is finding a person to be lonely through, and when that person goes to the hospital, stuffing that hole of loneliness with a ball of bright red construction paper. \"I'm dying,\" you'll say, with the paper everywhere, stuck with sweat to the walls where you fucked someone else, taped to the bottom of the bathtub. Gregory Sherl's Monogamy Songs is a book of lies. Everything is a lie, even this. And it's one of the truest books I've read.\" --Zachary SchomburgGregory Sherl is the author of two poetry collections: The Oregon Trail is the Oregon Trail and Heavy Petting, as well as the chapbooks I Have Touched You and Last Night Was Worth Talking About. His writing has appeared in Pank, The Los Angeles Review, The Good Men Project, Columbia Poetry Review, NAP, New Delta Review, and many other publications. He lives in Oxford, Mississippi.",
