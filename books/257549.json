  "description": "Scattered through the galaxy are thousands of worlds colonized by humans. Many have native microbes dangerous to the human immigrants. Others have diseases brought to them accidentally -- or on purpose -- by visiting ships. When millions of lives are threatened, it's a job for the Interstellar Medical Service, and a Med Ship is sent to solve the problem. Calhoun is the best the Med Service has, and hard experience has taught him that often the major obstacle to curing the sick is... the sick. And removing that kind of obstacle may take very strong medicine.This book is a compilation of four books released in the 1960's: The Mutant Weapon, Doctor to the Stars, S.O.S. from Three Worlds and This World is Taboo.3 • Med Ship Man • (1963)57 • Plague on Kryder II • (1964)121 • The Mutant Weapon • (1959)231 • Ribbon in the Sky • (1957)285 • Tallien Three (aka The Hate Disease) • (1963)351 • Quarantine World • (1966)425 • The Grandfathers' War • (1957)505 • Pariah Planet (aka This World is Taboo) • (1961)632 • Editors' Afterword by Eric Flint and Guy Gordon",
