  "description": "Follow orders...or follow her heart?Lena Stanton’s a sharpshooting zombie hunter with a hot-pink rifle and an attitude. Her latest assignment—guard bitten hero, Dr. Lucas Nye, and be ready to shoot the moment he starts to turn zombie. In the meantime, considering she’s the last female the man will ever see, Lena’s happy to indulge the doc in hot, steamy sex until he becomes symptomatic. After all, everybody has to do their part to help repopulate the planet. She tries to tell herself that’s all it is, but the good doctor has a way of slipping through her defenses. When last-minute research and a daring treatment could save Lucas, Lena has to choose. She can follow her heart and give the man a chance to live…or follow her commander’s orders and shoot to kill. Author's Note: Initially self-published, this book was subsequently purchased and re-released by Ellora’s Cave. The current (2014) edition is once again published by the author.",
