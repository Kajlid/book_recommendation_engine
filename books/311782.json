  "description": "The first two novels in Printz-winner Aidan Chambers’s Dance Sequence are at last available in a fresh format that will draw teens to these classics of YA literature.Literature is crap. Fiction is, anyway. A pretense. Ersatz. . . . When you read a story you are pretending a lie. —Morgan  What begins as a game for Ditto—the refutation of his friend Morgan’s Charges Against Literature—quickly escalates into a multilevel challenge. After Ditto’s father suffers a heart attack in the middle of one of their fights, Ditto decides he has to get away for a few days to sort out his life. His chronicle of his experiences becomes his rebuttal to Morgan’s Charges. But is this thought-provoking examination of people and ideas all fact . . . or fiction? Aidan Chambers leaves it up to the reader to decide in this novel that Publishers Weekly calls “excruciatingly funny as well as touching.” Includes a new afterword from the author! Praise for Aidan ChambersMichael L.
