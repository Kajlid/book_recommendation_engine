Fans of Bella Andre, Jill Shalvis and Kristen Proby will fall madly in love with the Abbotts and the heartwarming, sexy romance of the Green Mountain series. Almost seven years after losing her husband in Iraq, Hannah Abbott Guthrie isn't sure she's ready - or able - to move on, but the attentions of a lifelong friend are making her think about it for the first time. The memory of the sweet kiss she shared with Nolan Roberts hasn't strayed far from her thoughts, but she also fears that pursuing something with him would mean betraying her husband's memory. Nolan has loved Hannah for years, but he'd been giving her the space she needed to heal from her devastating loss. Now, when an opportunity arises to show her how he feels, Nolan can't resist, but he knows earning her love will take more than a kiss. Somehow he has to prove to Hannah that finding love twice in a lifetime is possible - and well worth risking her heart.***Published in the USA as \nI Want To Hold Your Hand\n***Don't miss Cameron and Will's story in \nYour Love Is All I Need",
