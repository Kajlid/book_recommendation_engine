  "title": "The Shepherd's Song",
  "description": "Joshua ben Levi, a young Judean shepherd, is in search of a miracle. His wife, Miriam, is expecting their first baby, but complications threaten to take the lives of both mother and child. In desperate need of God s help, Joshua journeys to the temple in Jerusalem to make an offering and to pray. What follows is a compassionate, emotional story about God s love as Joshua becomes one of the shepherds chosen to greet the Christ child on the night of his birth. Torn between concern for his wife and a desire to follow the angel s directive-- to go and find the babe lying in a manger-- Joshua makes a startling discovery that will change his life forever. What sets this Christmas story apart from many others is that although it is written as fiction, the descriptions of time, place, and circumstances are based on fact. This is a story that will penetrate your heart and remind you why the shepherds rejoiced on that wondrous night in Bethlehem.",
