  "description": "I'm surrounded by beautiful monsters, and they think I'm one of them.Sometime ago, I was captured by the Fae and stolen from my home to a place of eternal spring. It's beautiful here, or at least it would be, if everything wasn't trying to kill me.Arcadia isn't good to humans. The one thing I've got in my favor is, I don't look human anymore; not since my ex-roommate Kady stole my appearance, forced me to look like her, and then made tracks back to Earth, leaving me trapped here, pretending to be someone I'm not.Kady was supposed to take part in some Fae competition called the Favoring, but she's gone, and now I'm the one holding the ball. I'm outclassed, outmatched, but even worse than all that, I find myself constantly thinking about the tall, dark, and distant man that kidnapped me.The Viscount. He could've killed me by now, but he hasn't, and as the days go by, I feel like I'm drawing closer to him. He's a distraction I can't afford, not if I want to find a way back home.",
