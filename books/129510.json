Honorable Mention in the Los Angeles Book Festival. In this practical approach to mindfulness, there are no new belief systems to adopt or special rules to adhere to. Rather, whatâ€™s required is a letting go of our set beliefs and acceptance of what simply is. In this moment, this experience, peace is within our grasp.In This. Only This., veteran workshop teacher Michael H. Brooks presents a unique and humorous approach to mindfulness based on two main concepts: Paying Attention and Just Being. The former explores the many states of mind we engage in daily, highlighting their trends, patterns and causes. In simple language, Brooks shows how to unravel these thorny mindsets, and thus diminish their harmful effects. In Just Being, the author discusses the concept of being present and explains why we struggle so hard against being still, both mentally and physically. The book includes a wealth of exercises to anchor the concepts and help the reader connect them to his or her own circumstances.",
