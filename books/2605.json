  "title": "The Invention Of Curried Sausage",
  "description": "A bestseller in Germany, The Invention of Curried Sausage was tagged a \"novella,\" in the original sense of the word, \"a little piece of news.\" This is what author/narrator Uwe Timm uncovers about a popular German sidewalk food, curried sausage.Timm is convinced it originated not in Berlin in the fifties as generally supposed, but much earlier in his native Hamburg. He tracks down Lena Brucker, now living in a retirement home there. And, yes, curried sausage was her invention but it's a long story, one that Timm cajoles from her during a number of tea-time visits. It all started in April, 1945, just before the war's end when she met, seduced, and held captive a young deserter. The war was over, the lover escaped, and Lena Brucker, with remarkable ingenuity, went into business. That's where the sausage comes in!",
