  "description": "Briar Rose, a clever peasant girl, feels only pity for the mysterious Princess Rosalinda–the hidden princess who was cursed to prick her finger on a spindle and fall asleep until true love’s kiss awakens her. But her pity turns into horror when Briar learns she is the secret princess, and Isaia, her childhood friend, is really a Magic Knight sworn to protect her.  Briar reluctantly embraces her new life as a princess, and is reunited with her mother, father, and her grandfather–the king. But calamity strikes when Carabosso, the evil mage who cursed her as a baby, returns and plunders the countryside. Unfortunately, the king refuses to dispatch the Magic Knights to protect the people, and instead orders the knights to stay in the capital to guard Briar. But Briar is not the demure princess her family desires, and she vows to save her people if her parents and grandfather will not.  Will the curse consume Briar, or–with help from Isaia–can she beat Carabosso at his own game?  SLEEPING BEAUTY is a fairy tale retelling and the eighth book of the TIMELESS FAIRY TALES series. The books in this series take place in the same world and can be read all together, or as individual, stand-alone books.
