  "description": "SOME GIRLS HAVE ALL THE LUCKUnfortunately, I am not one of those girls. Not when I lost my apartment because my roommate let the lease lapse while I travel for work. Not when my brothers keep finding love and my mother keeps reminding me I’m still single. Not after a one-night stand during my older brother’s wedding has me waking up pregnant. I have to keep it a secret—from him, and my family. I sure can’t tell my brother his teammate, Mateo Espinoza, is the man I slept with.Confident, funny, Mateo…A GUY CAN’T CATCH A BREAKJust when I thought I’d found the girl of my dreams, she ghosts me. Worse? Her brother refuses to give me her number, and my calls to her office go straight to voicemail. I thought I was a catch; professional athlete, charming, raised with six sisters—I’m a guy who knows his way to a woman’s heart! What reason could she possibly have for avoiding me? When I finally catch up to True Wallace, I’m going to get the answer.",
