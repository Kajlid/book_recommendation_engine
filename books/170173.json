  "description": "World War II left thousands of New Zealander families without husbands and fathers when they answered the call to serve in the ANZACS military. Many of them owned working cattle or sheep stations where tremendous responsibilities fell on the young shoulders of sons and daughter left behind. Nineteen year old Matthew Patton is no exception, but as well as his deceased father he is now facing the stark reality of raising his brothers and sisters when his terminally ill mother also passes. Finally reaching a desperate moment of need he is encouraged to seek help from a young Aussie governess looking for a new post. There is just one problem. The letter he composes and sends her is written as though it were penned by his father. Matthew is painfully aware she may come, realize he has lied to her and leave immediately as did the other prospective but undesirable governesses. But nothing prepares him for the tenacious personality of Srenna Adelaide James when she not only excepts the position but attacks the young orphaned family's needs with a zeal unlike anything he has ever experienced. In spite of their rocky beginning the two find themselves facing the daunting every day challenges of five children, 1200 acres of land and 1500 sheep. Their greatest test will be their budding relationship as they learn to love, heal, forgive and trust ultimately in the God who never missed a single step they took.",
