  "description": "New York, 1924. Vivian Kelly has gotten a job at the Nightingale, a speakeasy known to the young and fun as a place where the rules of society can be tossed aside for a dance and a drink, and things are finally looking up for her and her sister Florence. They might not be living like queens?still living in a dingy two-room tenement, still scrimping and saving?but they're confident in keeping a roof over their heads, and every once in a while, there is fried ham for breakfast. Of course, things were even better before Bea's Uncle Pearlie, the doorman for the Nightingale, was poisoned. Bea has been Vivian's best friend since before she can remember, and though Pearlie's death is ruled a suicide, Bea's sure her uncle wouldn't have killed himself. After all, he had the family to care for...and there have been rumors of a mysterious letter writer, blackmailing Vivian's poorest neighbors for their most valuable possessions, threatening poison if they don't comply. With the Nightingale's dangerously lovely owner, Honor, worried for her employees' safety and Bea determined to prove her uncle was murdered, Vivian once again finds herself digging through a dead man's past in hopes of stopping a killer.",
