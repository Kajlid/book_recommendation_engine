  "description": "CALL OF THE WILD â€” Forced to share an office with the science department's new darling, Doug Traxler, Meredith found that her year teaching literature was a nightmare. She never knew what she might find floating in formaldehyde on her desk. Now, to her horror, she had to hike with Doug's ecology class all summer. Nature Girl she was not, but when Doug dared her to come down from her ivory tower and meet the demands of the wilderness, she accepted the challenge. She found that far more than her pride was at stake. Doug had opened her heart as well as her mind to the world around her.",
