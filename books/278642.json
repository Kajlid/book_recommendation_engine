  "description": "Four thousand years from now, the last remnants of humanity battle for survival beneath a hostile sun. Two thousand people remain suspended in endless slumber while others toil for the means to wake them. Carnal desires and the lexicon of physical pleasures have been forgotten in the long age that passed since the last humans made love. Barbaric dreams and strange fantasies are all that remain. Ehlana, historian and time traveler, becomes the unwitting bridge between her own time and ours as she travels in search of an answer. She discovers that her own primal memories provide the key which unlocks the door to another world and her own sexual awakening.",
