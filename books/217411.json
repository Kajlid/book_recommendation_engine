  "description": "Alice was green eyes, a smile from across the room, a delicate kiss easily missed, and the brief touch of hand. Alice was dancing, laughter and hair you could run your fingers through forever. Alice was everything. Now Lepus had nothing. Lepus, a teacher, a scientist, an engineer, a philosopher, a thinker; he knew the circumference of the world and everything there was to know about the fundamental theorem of calculus. He was a calming stillness, while all of Alice was movement and adventure. Now Lepus only had the four walls of his plain white room. Left wondering why and how it all changed so quickly. Trapped and lost in the maze of his mind, he searches his memories for a moment. For a missed word, a glance or any sign. Sights, sounds and the past converge, twisting and turning to form this allegorical account, of his descent from sanity. Joined by an ensemble of colourful characters, the reader follows Lepus as he treads a tangled path back to reality. This is modern day fable that will have readers questioning until the last page. The Plain White Room is a novel about mental illness, love, friendship, and the white light that will one day beckon us all",
