  "description": "To Faedra, faeries were nothing more than the figurines she collected and displayed in her curio cabinet. Or so she thought... Faeries control nature. With a book, no less. But Faedra doesn't know that...yet. She is next in line to protect an ancient fae amulet that controls weather. And she's blissfully unaware of that fact, too. She also doesn't know that the book has been stolen and now the thief is after the amulet and willing to kill for it. Ignorance is bliss, and then you turn 18.",
