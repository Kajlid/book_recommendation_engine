  "description": "This is a short story. Job would preach his sermons with a powerful voice that echoed throughout the church. All would stop and make their way to the sanctuary to hear and hope. Hope ... was all they had left. The undead horde outside would pound upon the barred church doors when Father Job addressed the congregation. It had made Claire wonder if it was too late for salvation.",
