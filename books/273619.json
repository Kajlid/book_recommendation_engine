  "description": "It's the middle of the breeding season in Upstate New York, and the top stallions in Kent Stephenson's veterinary practice are being systematically eliminated by sudden death, rare disease, and mysterious disappearance.Kent, his Redbone hound, Lucinda, and his teenage daughter, Emily, put their lives on the line to find out why. Their investigation leads them from horseracing's seedy underbelly of fixes and doping, to the staid aristocracy of Kentucky's famed bluegrass horse farms, struggling to keep their legacy of great stallions. Then they descend into the world of a super-rich, South American drug lord, who collects horses the way he collects beautiful women. It's a race to the wire as they jockey to keep themselves alive, save the stallions, and stop whoever is behind it all. What they discover rocks the horse industry.And it will rock the very soul of any lover of these great beasts.",
