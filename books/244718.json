  "title": "Smoke and Mirrors : An Experience of China",
  "description": "Winner of the Vodaphone Crossword Readers Choice Award 2008 by far the most well-informed and entertaining account of life in the Middle Kingdom by an Indian India Today India and China share a 3500 km border and have interacted with each other for over 2000 years. It is remarkable then that their people know so little of each what they think, how they live, their language, customs and philosophy. Or even their cuisine. Very much the average Indian in her knowledge of China when she set out for Beijing in 2002, Pallavi Aiyar soon became intrigued by the country and its strange mix of material prosperity and authoritarianism. As she compares it with Indias experience of development, Pallavi Aiyar provides a perceptive analysis of the strengths and weakness of the process in both countries. An intimate look at a society undergoing relentless change, Smoke and An Experience of China destroys many clich√©s as it opens new gateways through the Great Wall of China.",
