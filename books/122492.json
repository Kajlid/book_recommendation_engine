  "description": "Someone once told me I give Daddy Issues a bad name. I laughed at the time, but since I found myself living with my dad’s best friend, Stuart Wiseman, it doesn’t feel all that funny anymore.Living with him is a nightmare. He’s super pedantic about everything. He took one look at me and decided I need help with adulting, and he seems absolutely positive he’s the man for the job. He’s hellbent on improving me, scolding me about this and correcting me on that.Obviously I don’t take it lying down, I give as good as I get.Things come to a head one night and I find myself staring down the barrel of a thick, angry index finger pointed close to my face.“You’re playing with fire, Boy, and you’re headed for leather.”Every schema I’ve ever used to make sense of the world implodes.I’m furious. I hate it. Fully hate it. Hate every single thing about it.Except that I don’t - and that makes it worse. Way worse. Some stupid part of me loves it. Some even stupider part craves it.Lucky for me, Stuart knows a Daddy’s boy when he sees one. He offers to discipline and take care of me, to do the hard parts of adulting for me until I get back on my feet. Obviously, it isn’t a relationship. He’s literally old enough to be my father. So no, it’s not a relationship. Get your mind out of the gutter. It’s an arrangement…A Daddy Arrangement.And that’s all it will ever be.Right?",
