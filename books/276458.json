  "description": "The secret is out.I’m officially dating the entire Student Council, but that’s not the only thing that’s outside the norm at Adamson All-Boys Academy.Nah, I think the murders are a bit more remarkable, although my dad might disagree. He’s not exactly thrilled with my fake fiancé or the other four boys that make my pulse race.With two current students dead, and three attackers on my tail, it looks like I’m next. The fact that I’m a target isn’t in question, but are the people closest to me involved somehow? Everyone’s a suspect—my family, my classmates, even my new boyfriends.Okay, that’s it. I’m going to do it: I’m going to attend Adamson in a fucking skirt, and kick some ass.Follow the clues, catch the bad guys, secure my future. Because, murder-mysteries aside, this is my final year of high school, and nothing lasts forever, right? Not even a forever crew.***THE FOREVER CREW is a 120,000 word lighthearted reverse harem/high school/murder-mystery romance novel with a bully/suspense twist. This is book three of three in the series (with a fourth book crossover coming, titled \"Orientation\", that connects this series with my \"Rich Boys of Burberry Prep\" series). Contains foul language and sexual scenes; any sex featured is consensual.",
