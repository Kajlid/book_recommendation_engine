  "description": "Social media has changed everything about the way we communicate, yet sometimes it can all feel so overwhelming. Where do you start? Maybe you want to blog, but where do you begin? What do you say? How do you get anyone to care about what you have to say? “Are You There, Blog? It’s Me, Writer” is a compilation of social media expert Kristen Lamb’s best social media blogs and lessons, and some additional material only found here. This book is designed to be a laugh-out-loud journey to the heart of social media.Many of us know we need a social media platform, but what exactly does that mean? Most of us would rather have brain surgery with a KFC spork than learn about computers and social marketing. Fortunately, “Are You There, Blog? It’s Me, Writer” is not your average social marketing book. This book will strip away all those fears and teach you how to make the most of Twitter, Facebook, and blogging and give you all you need to build a worldwide platform based on relationship and community. Kristen will show you how to manage time, be more productive, and maximize the top social media tools. The best part is you’ll be having so much fun, you will forget you’re supposed to be learning.",
