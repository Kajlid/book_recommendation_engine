An angle that teaches him the true meaning of friendship, loyalty and trust in ways he had never experienced before.

In a struggle to handle this situation he gets pulled deeper and deeper into a swamp of conspiracies and coincidences surrounding a young girl and the very truth about magic in the real world...",
