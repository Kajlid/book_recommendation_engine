  "description": "In a modern day American city, there are those who track and hunt down humans for their fear. They are indiscernable from you and me. A young woman with attitude in her mid-twenties, Ame, has fallen in with them. Her abduction was foretold by the voices in her head. She has the same light in her eyes that marks them. In this sequel to Katya Mills' urban fantasy, Daughter of Darkness, Ame has fallen in love with a young man who shares the dark gift. He skateboards into her life and they roam the streets together. Conflicted by her own violent nature, she has become nevertheless intoxicated by the ways. She thirsts after 'the tangy energetic'. A death dealer of a different kind prowls around the boarding house where Ame and her boyfriend live. Meanwhile her best friend, Bless, vies for her attention. Hendrix, a bloodhound for tracking fear, inadvertently leads Ame to Kell, a kindred spirit in the grips of a terrible addiction. She takes her little sister with green eyes under her wing. Just as Ame seems to have found her rhythm in the chaos surrounds her, someone very close to her disappears. In her search she uncovers a secret, revealed on the tapes of a security camera, which threatens to uproot her, once again.",
