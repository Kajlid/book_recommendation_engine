It recounts the tale of a social worker from the South, who started to telephone famous men she admired, wondering what it would be like to know them up-close and personal. Organized chronologically, spotlighting six intimate, long-lasting relationships, as well as others that were fun but fizzled, this is irresistible reading for any fan of celebrity gossip.Miranda Rites explores celebrity, power, and the loneliness and isolation fame can bring -- even stars just want somebody to talk to. A loving friend, therapist, and confidante to the stars, Miranda became an urban legend -- and this is her story.",
