  "title": "One Hand for Jenny",
  "description": "We are sometimes given works to do that we do not understand the meaning there-of, nor do we know the how, or the why, that we believe that we are given to accomplish these works. The meaning and the way remain unclear unto us, and yet we have the conviction that this is what we are being asked to do. This, then, becomes our journey of faith. My journey of faith has been travel. For three decades I crossed the oceans, deserts, mountains, and jungles of this world. I sailed the seas, flew the skies, and traversed the land without sponsors or fanfare; traveling this world perhaps as no other has before. One Hand for Jenny is the account of one of my travels; that of sailing around the world alone. I hope you enjoy this voyage.",
