  "title": "Spider Silk",
  "description": "A suspicious death leads to a manhunt and the capture of self-confessed killer Bill Casey. But when Sheriff Henry “Bud” Blair reads the autopsy report, he begins to suspect that someone other than Casey is the actual killer. Set in a sparsely settled, high desert landscape of fault scarps, hot springs, marshlands, big lakes and timber mountains, Spider Silk is also a love story. Burned badly by divorce, Bud Blair steers shy of women. But his work makes it almost impossible to avoid contact with the beautiful Yakima Indian woman, Nancy Sixkiller, who manages the Emergency Services Center for Lake County, Oregon. That contact is intensified when Bud is injured and Nancy takes on the role of care-giver.",
