  "title": "Earth and High Heaven",
  "description": "Earth and High Heaven is, simply, a drama of human relationships -- of two people in love who are confronted by the obstacle of racial intolerance -- presented with such cutting truth, such fidelity to life, such compassion and understanding, that their problem becomes, indelibly, the reader's own. With rare perceptiveness, Gwethalyn Graham takes the reader into the lives of Erica Drake and Marc Reiser, whose two worlds are separated by families and conventions. Here is the story of a man and woman who dared earth and high heaven to make their vision real.",
