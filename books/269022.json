A place we could start over, open our tattoo shop, and ignore the rest of the world.It’s a great plan, except for one little we never expected to find her up on the mountain.Gorgeous, sassy, innocent, and tempting in that way where she doesn’t even know it. We know two outlaws like us should stay away from Kennedy McKinnon. We know those sweet curves and soft, pouty lips are off limits. But when one night of mayhem brings us crashing into her, there’s not a power on earth that could keep us from her and from claiming what’s ours .The ghosts of our past aren’t through with us though. There’s a sociopath of a mob a-hole looking to take us down and hurt everything we love.But that is not going to happen. Because what’s our is ours . Ours to protect, ours to share . And we’ll fight like h*ll to keep her safe.Kennedy’s worried about coming between us. But trust me, that’s our goal. She’s worried about having to choose one of us.…She’s not going to have to.Please note that the Blackthorn Mountain Men books can be read in any order.Hold on tight! Double the outlaw seems to have turned into double the book length for this one! Get ready for the longest Blackthorn book yet - wildly over the top and stuffed, packed, and filled to the brim with more growly alpha outlaw than you ever saw coming ;).This mfm romance is ALL about her – no m/m. As with all my books, this standalone is safe, with no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.",
