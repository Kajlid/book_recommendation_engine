  "description": "Charity Styles is a world class sharpshooter, martial arts expert, and government assassin... but after a stressful assignment, all she wants is a little time to unwind on the quiet side of St. Thomas, the picturesque Magens Bay. What does she get? A hurricane, an ex, drug dealers, a psychotic murderer, an amorous developer, and forced to stay in the rowdy tourist town of Charlotte-Amalie. Naturally. By the time she sails Wind Dancer back to her beloved Magens Beach, a storm is brewing that threatens to displace her again, but this is a man-made storm and Charity has had all she can take. She's stressed and reckless and not even her friends can hold her in check as she takes on a fight that could change her future and the future of those she cares for.",
