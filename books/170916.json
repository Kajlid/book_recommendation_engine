  "description": "An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here.Having found his place as a squire to a Norman knight, Roland Inness sets off with his master, Sir Roger de Laval, and fellow squire on a perilous mission to the Holy Land. King Richard has sworn to take Jerusalem from Saladin and orders Sir Roger to assess the military situation. Joining them is the Templar Knight Tuck as they contend with Moors, Berbers and a Sicilian usurper before reaching the battlefields in the east. There, Roland sees the ugly face of war and tests his mettle.  In England, the land is awash in political intrigue, led by Prince John and Sir William de Ferrers, Roland's mortal enemy. Countering them is Queen Eleanor who picks Sir Roger's daughter Millicent for her own missionâ€”one that puts her at the centre of a plot to turn England against King Richard.  Warbow, the action-filled follow-on to Longbow, is the second book in The Saga of Roland Inness series.",
