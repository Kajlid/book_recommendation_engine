  "description": "In 1964, Dr. Luther Terry released the monumental Surgeon General’s report revealing the connection between smoking and ill health, specifically linking tobacco use to lung cancer and heart disease. And yet in 2014, fifty years later, more than fifty million Americans still smoke.Quit or Die Trying isn’t a self-help book about giving up smoking—it’s a candid, irreverent, eye-opening story about one woman’s struggle to overcome her tobacco addiction.In 1986, a good twenty years after everyone knows tobacco is bad for them, when twelve-year-old Alison Beard should be playing ding-dong-ditch and chasing butterflies, she starts smoking instead. Like a lot of Americans, she believes the persistent propaganda that it’s just a habit she can quit at any time—until one harrowing day in her twenties, when she awakens with a collapsed lung.In her heartfelt memoir, Beard shares the crazy cocktails of medicine and diversion tactics she employs in her attempt to rid herself of her addiction. Having tried to quit more times than she kept count, she identifies the false assumptions and unhelpful social attitudes to reveal changes that would have a powerful impact on the success rate of quitting.",
