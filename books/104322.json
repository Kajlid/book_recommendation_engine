His Martian overlord, Pandarus, has implanted a dark voice in his mind, a voice that urges betrayal.

Posing as double agents and investigating cryptic rumors of \"hollow ships,\" they find him impersonating a London banker and worm their way into his confidence.But their success brings them trouble in spades. Pandarus takes them into the belly of his ships, where he plans to transfigure them into mindless automata. And with Earth on the brink of invasion, Frost's old flame Theodora reappearing and Pandarus's brainwashing growing more effective, Mason and Frost will find their bond tested as never before.See how it all began in Agamemnon Frost and the House of Death. 28,000 wordsSteampunk male/male romance",
