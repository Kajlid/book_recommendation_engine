  "description": "This is an ACE for ISBN13:9781626819245 The Office AdventureA comic choose-your-own-path novel for adults. Play as a miserable, hungover office worker just trying to zombie through another awful day at work. Should you show up for the big meeting or duck out with Debby, the weird woman from HR who keeps making suggestive comments about FDR? Play the fatty lump in your back for office-wide sympathy, or dive into a WebMD spiral that can only end in “cancer?” Tell someone about the weird genital-fondling that’s happening at the crystal healer’s, or just accept that this is the best substitution you’ll find for love, today...or maybe ever? In CYOM: TOA, you have countless “options,” but they rarely end well. It’s okay, though. A life of adventure would require so many uncomfortable sleeping situations. Besides, you have dental. Keep reminding yourself about the dental.",
