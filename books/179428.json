His kind lived in a palace in Noble's Rest, the largest town of the land. With his son at his side, his rule had been long and comfortable.  This all threatens to change when his son takes a human girl as his Chosen. With the Nobles of the palace upset, the Patriarch tries to guide his son while guarding the secrets of their race, letting slip information that sends his son away from the palace... and his bride unprotected.  Dartein has been alive for centuries, but never felt truly alive until he met Josaleene. Defying all Noble customs, he took her as his chosen and bound the two together for eternity. But their happiness does not seem destined to last, as long-buried secrets surface and begin to tear them apart.  Upset that his father, the Patriarch, seems unwilling to help, Dartein is desperate to find the answer that will save their love. With the threat of enemies lurking nearby, he leaves his lady to seek out the one thing that could help them. The price of the answer is blood... but whose?  Praise for BLOOD PRICE: \"Blood Price gripped me from the first page until the last.\" - Charlotte Web Anderson, author of Treasure of Pi \"This book is packed with everything a fantasy reader craves.\" - J.
