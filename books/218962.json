  "description": "Given a choice, I’d prefer never to return to Egypt. Isis doesn’t do choices.\nThe old world is dead. Legend tells us the gods are myths. But some remain, like a noose around Ace Dante’s neck. And none are more dangerous than Isis. She demands the Soul Eater return to the land time forgot, break into a newly discovered tomb, and retrieve the skull from the sarcophagus inside. If Ace does this one thing, Isis will reveal the secrets he desperately seeks. Ace knows there’s a catch, there always is, but the truth is far worse than even he can imagine. As Isis’s true intentions unravel, so does Ace’s past, leaving him no choice at all. History is wrong. The past is a lie. And for the Soul Eater, the truth found in Egypt is far more terrifying than any god.",
