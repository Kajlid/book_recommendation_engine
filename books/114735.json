  "description": "Sixteen-year-old Callie Baxter refuses to just sit tight and accept the invaders who have occupied her city. Underneath the new Government’s façade of order and fairness lies the ugly reason for its being here, and it’s up to Callie’s group of underground rebels to expose its brutal objective. She’s worked hard to keep her fledgling group of passionate rebels alive, but as the Government’s hit squads narrow in on them, she realises she has only just begun to understand the pain of loss, and the true cost of growing up. Abi Godsell uses the groundbreaking new format of a short story science fiction series for a highly entertaining and smart read. In the first instalment of the Idea War series, we’re introduced to the characters behind the resistance to the Chinese occupation of Johannesburg, South Africa. Through the perspectives of various characters, it soon becomes clear that the new government’s first priority is far removed from the one they propagate on the blimps that dot the city’s skyline. The city represents a shining example of recovery to the outside world, but can a small group of determined teenagers overcome the decay that has taken root at its core?",
