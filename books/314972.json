  "title": "Young Medieval Women",
  "description": "The book consists of a collection of interdisciplinary essays, each of which takes an individual approach to young women or the notion of 'youth' as a stage in women's lives in late medieval Europe. Topics include prostitution, Joan of Arc, a New interpretation of the representation of young women in the Malterer Embroidery, rape in medieval literature, queenmaking during the Wars of the Roses, female wardship, virgin martyrs, and maidenhood as the 'perfect age' of a woman's life. Together they form a unique collection which is both wide-ranging in its examination of numerous themes related to young medieval women and coherent in its social and historical focus on the culture of late medieval north-western Europe.",
