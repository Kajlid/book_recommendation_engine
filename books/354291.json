  "title": "Dachshunds Can Fly",
  "description": "Traveling with a dog, especially a dachshund, is entertaining and challenging. In the early nineties, my husband Richard and I spent a short time traveling in Germany and Greece and after that lived in France for one year, with our dog. Our dachshund's name was also Richard; in order to avoid confusion, we called him the Little Dog. The Little Dog, who already had strong opinions about his likes and dislikes, fell in love with French bread. No one could remove it from his mouth once it had landed there, which happened frequently. His antics, and his relentless energy and enthusiasm are a formidable presence in this tale of travel, food, and daily life in another culture.",
