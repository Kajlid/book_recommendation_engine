  "description": "My father once told me, above all else... Live and die for Sparta.  Honor. Loyalty. Duty. These were the things that mattered most.  And then Axios came into my life, teaching me other lessons: humility, brotherhood... love. There were moments when the brutal training stripped me of my humanity, where it turned me into a mindless beast of flesh and muscle set to destroy everything in my way. But then Axios stood in my way, ever vigilant, never failing to bring me back to myself.  Love had no place in Sparta, they said. It made you weak.  So why did I feel stronger with him by my side?   *Eryx: A Spartan Tale is a 149k word historical gay fiction featuring a love story between Spartan warriors. Although told in an alternate point of view of the events in Axios, it includes extended scenes and more content. It can be read as a complete standalone.*",
