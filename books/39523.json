  "description": "Regan Taylor is already heading toward a date she'd rather not entertain. She thinks her night can't get any worse, until blue lights illuminate the night behind her, and the strong, commanding voice at her window strikes a nerve she didn't know was there.Officer Alex Shaw is amused when the innocent brown-eyed woman staring up at him starts to argue at his accusations; she awakens a part of him that he has kept locked away. Despite his haunting past, pieces of his dominant side peek out, and he lets her go with a warning not to speed through his zone again.When sparks fly between them, Regan sets out on a mission of self-discovery, but soon finds out the intense desire Alex brings out in her, leaves him cold. Can Alex overcome his past and act on his dark desires with her, or is it too late?",
