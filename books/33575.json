  "description": "Android replicas of comic book superheroes live among us. They were created to be the ultimate indulgence of the very rich, but as a result of a ruling by the Supreme Court they are now free citizens. Free super-powered, thinking, feeling beings with deeply programmed tendencies toward good or evil. And now the most evil one of all has found a way to deactivate the mind hobbles that keep him docile and law-abiding. Can a reluctant, down-on-his-luck android, created in the image of the greatest comic book hero of all, find a way to stop this deadly being before he either crushes a terrified humanity beneath his feet or forces them to destroy all artificial people, good and evil?",
