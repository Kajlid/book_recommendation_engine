  "description": "It is the year 3748 A.D. An alien race from beyond our solar system now rule Earth and Venus. All is not lost, as hope for man may lie with a beautiful lost princess. 19-year-old Karl Sabers’ only knowledge of life is existence on a generational ship launched centuries ago. When his evangelical-minded sister, Denise, is propelled into space after an alien attack, Karl must journey into the depths of the unknown universe in a rescue attempt. Surviving the attack but shanghaied into piracy, his fate is entangled with a mysterious alien girl’s quest. He might perish, but for an unexpected appearance by man's best friend – the cat. Long thought extinct, the cat returns to aid and abet descendants of past feline owners. Karl, seeing himself as protector, hides the animal to keep it safe, but soon finds himself dependent on the feline’s wiles. Escaped from a research laboratory jail, the kitty bodyguard named Lightening has his paws full helping his new master cope with perils of the galaxy. To safeguard his human, Lightening must mark new territory throughout the universe. The entry of the female alien complicates this human-feline relationship, as they become the target of both pirates and bouty hunters. Lightening has to work even harder to keep Karl out of trouble. In the 38th century, where the kingdoms and empires of old have been replaced, Karl will find a destiny he could never have that imagined.",
