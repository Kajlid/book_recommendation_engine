Revenge would be the only way to clear her soul of the darkness placed by that man, and if a few criminals are taught a lesson along the way all the better.

So by day she is still the sweet woman she was before, but by night she is The Dark Angel.An edgy psychological thriller, Rise of the Dark Angel is not for the faint of heart with some mild violence and references to sexual abuse and torture.",
