  "description": "A sarcastic storyteller traps three characters in his web in order to get hold of a special book.  Daniel, Cassidy and Igor are three unique individuals, considered outcasts for different reasons. They are about to meet and stick together, as coincidences and forced situations lead them to a journey all around Europe.  As everyone is after the Book of the Forsaken, the coming Game is about to take place on the dark side of the moon. But there is a cost to that knowledge. Let alone to the wish to partake.  \"The Book of the Forsaken\" got the gold medal on authonomy.com's HarperCollins UK hosted competition on Feb 1. 2012.",
