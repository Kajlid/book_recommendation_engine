  "description": "In Prosperity Glades, a small town on the shores of Lake Okeechobee, you can run across Dr. Axel J. Hyde, the County's Assistant Medical Examiner. He's an eye-catching man, yet hides a dark secret from the age of ten. He's a remorseless murderer with a weird twist: a 'Rider' urges him to hunt and dismember 'people who feeds on fear'. Sexual killers, rapists, pedophiles - none escape his cold fury. ​However, when someone begins 'poaching' into his territory, Axel is caught between the urge to find and kill this kindred soul or greet another of his 'species'. Is the Rider a real spiritual entity or just the product of a kid's scarred psyche? ​Do you dare to find out?'An Inner Darkness that must be Fed.'",
