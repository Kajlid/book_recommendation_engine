  "description": "The Shadow Hero is based on the adventures of the Green Turtle, who solved crimes and fought injustice just like any other comics hero of the 1940s. But this mysterious masked crusader was hiding something more than your run-of-the-mill secret identity . . . The Green Turtle was the first Asian American superhero. Now, New York Times–bestselling author Gene Luen Yang has created a riveting, hilarious, and moving origin story for the Green Turtle. With artwork by the unmatched Sonny Liew, this gorgeous graphic novel about heroism and heritage is also a loving tribute to the long, rich tradition of American superhero comics. ———The first issue of The Shadow Hero, \"The Green Turtle Chronicles,\" introduces our hero, Hank. Living with his mother and father in Chinatown, Hank dreams of nothing beyond the small grocery his family runs. Little does he know that his mother has other ideas for her son's future!",
