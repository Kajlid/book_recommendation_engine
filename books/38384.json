  "description": "I thought she was brave for going on her honeymoon alone. I just didn’t think I’d wind up joining her.I've been known to jump headfirst into adventure without thinking about the consequences, but pretending to be married? That was never on my thrill-seeking to-do list.It's not Molly's fault her ex left her high and dry, but his loss is my gain. If she needs a fake husband for the honeymoon of a lifetime, count me in.Fancy dinners? Excursions? A romantic joy flight over the Hawaiian Islands? No complaints from me.But the more time I spend with Molly, the more trouble I'm in. I'm not the knight in shining armor Molly needs for the long haul. But when I'm with her, I feel like I could be.",
