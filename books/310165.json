No one knew what happened to them. Until now.When Kit and Red set foot on French soil during the Normandy landings, they know they have to rely on each other. As they head for the battlefield, their aim is simple: save lives. But when they're called away on a top-secret mission to patch up a few men behind enemy lines, everything changes.Alongside fellow nurses, Roxy and Gail, they're told to prepare for the worst, trading in their nurses' fatigues for civilian clothes and hiding medical supplies under their skirts. But it's a lie. Their real mission tasks them with the impossible â€“ to infiltrate the Reich and steal something the Nazis desperately need to win their losing war.In an ultimate test of courage and comradeship, each woman must decide what she is prepared to risk and what she has to live for.",
