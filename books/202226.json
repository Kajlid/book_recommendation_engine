  "title": "Shivaratri, How I Saw God",
  "description": "Shivaratri â€“ How I saw God is a story of personal and spiritual development, as well as testament to a passage from bad karma to good. The author alerts us to the existence of an intelligent force that moves everything in the universe, and to the fact that suddenly anything in our lives can change.  With her mind completely lost after a troubled life, Susana decides to travel to India where she is charmed and somehow feels reborn into a new life. Her experiences in the main religious centres of Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism; a meeting with the Dalai Lama; and a whirlwind of emotions that cause her immense inner suffering, motivate her to improve herself spiritually.  Meanwhile, Susana meets her twin soul who ends up leaving her. But fate is pragmatic, insisting on coincidences and discreetly pointing the way to Africa. The action of this story takes place amid the bustle and smells of India, the magic of Africa and chaos of a Portugal submerged in financial crisis.  Yoga and Transcendental Meditation appear as an escape from reality by the author who lives immersed in an ocean of existential questions.  The answers to all these questions come to her through karmic astrology, past life regression and two trips to Uganda. Finally, Susana returns to India where meets her Guru who invites her to plunge deeper into Transcendental Meditation and to see the Divinity.  This book tells a wonderful story that is not just a story of life guided by delivery and abandonment, love and loneliness, altruism and disappointment. This story is also about self-knowledge, Karma, Dharma, Faith and evolution of the soul. It is above all, a story that shows us how meeting with our spirituality becomes a refuge in our everyday problems.",
