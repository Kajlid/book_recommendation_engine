  "title": "Atomic Cover-Up: Two U.S. Soldiers, Hiroshima & Nagasaki, and The Greatest Movie Never Made",
  "description": "Now also available in Kindle edition: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005CKK9IGThis is a detective story, a profile of two remarkable military officers, and one of the last little-told stories of World War II (and its aftermath). The cover-up even extended to Hollywood. And there was no WikiLeaks to get the film aired.Mitchell, co-author of the classic \"Hiroshima in America\" and eleven other books, has written about parts of this story for leading newspapers and magazines, but now tells the full saga, based on new research -- from the Truman Library to Nagasaki.How did this happen? Why? And what did the two military officers, Daniel McGovern and Herbert Sussan, try to do about it, for decades? \"Atomic Cover-up\" answers all of these questions in a quick-paced but often surprising narrative.",
