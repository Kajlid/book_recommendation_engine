  "description": "Luna Lodge series, book 5.Still bitter over the loss of his last real chance at bonding, the hybrid Apollo has slowly alienated his friends and colleagues at Luna Lodge. Trying to convince himself that love makes the hybrids weak, he’s decided to dedicate his life to protecting the other hybrids, even if it means he can never find true happiness.Though he’s convinced the hybrids are ignoring the continuing dangers in their midst, including harbouring the affable but suspicious Rem, his superiors seem more interested in having him babysit a security technician than putting his skills to use helping to secure their compound.Val Hart pulled a lot of strings and committed more than a few cyber-crimes to get herself a temporary technician job with the suspicious hybrids for a mission that may allow her finally to understand why she’s felt different all her life. When her unexpected and intense attraction to Apollo threatens her focus, she has to do what she can to distance herself from the hybrid. After all, Val knows the truth about love: it’s nothing but a gateway to loss.As the pair tangle over their emotional wounds, the enemies of Luna Lodge wait in the shadows, preparing to launch their deadliest strike yet.",
