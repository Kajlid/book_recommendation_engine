  "title": "Framed & Hunted: A True Story of Occult Persecution",
  "description": "Backpacking around Australia in the year 2000, the author unwittingly found himself the target of occult persecution by some very devious, sinister and well organised others. Barely noticeable at first, this true story details the nature, methods and gradual intensification of the target's gang stalking, from intimidation, gas lighting and neuro-linguistic programming which, ultimately, led to repeated druggings, poisonings, remote mind control, sexual honey traps, rape, murder, lost babies and more.Spanning fourteen years and five continents, prostitutes, hitmen, intelligence agents, ladyboys, thieves, junkies and shaman are just a few of the people encountered in places as far and wide as the Rif Mountains, the Amazon Rainforest, South East Asian jungles and the Australian Outback. From Bangkok to Beirut, Medellin to Johannesburg and a hundred other cities in between; from Jamaican strip clubs to South African military bases and gangster villas in Thailand to bus crashes in Panama, this is a story like no other.It is strong, bold and brutally honest. Will suit those interested in the subjects of gang stalking, targeted individuals, mind control, international travel, backpacking, freelance journalism, sex, drugs and rock n roll, and anyone else who likes to be transported into another world by the pages of a good book.",
