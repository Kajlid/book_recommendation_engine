  "description": "The Ladies Historical Society is proud to take you on a tour through the rich history of our fair town. From its humble founding by the ill-fated explorer Percival Rumph, to its most famous mayor, Arthur Blackburn, Portsong stands out as a place of culture and flair. Meet Mortimer Lee, who is singlehandedly responsible for saving the city from the Yankee's path of destruction during the War Between the States. You will even get a laugh at the incident now refered to as The Great Sheep Donnybrook of 1908. It's all here in our little booklet we call, A Concise History of Portsong. Why, it's almost as good as sippin' lemonade on Ms. Prattlematt's back porch.",
