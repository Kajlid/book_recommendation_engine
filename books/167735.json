  "description": "Lives have been lost, alliances have been split, and the answers to Brynn’s unending questions are in sight, though still escaping her. But after losing both Ty and Jonah inside of the mazelike facility of A1 with a promise to herself that she’ll come back for them, Brynn wakes up in a mysterious cabin with no idea of where she is, how long she’s been there, and no memory of how she escaped from A1 and the murderous A.I., Eris. Now Brynn must try to piece her broken memories back together while finding herself instinctually drawn back to A1, as if someone else is calling the shots in her mind. With time for her home-continent Halcyon’s termination drawing near and time running out for her friends who are trapped, Brynn has to make sense of the conflicting thoughts in her brain before everything around her comes crashing down. The final stand-off between Brynn and Eris will prove that only one can remain when the truth comes out.",
