  "description": "All it takes is one DEFIANT man... Monty Randolph has always bristled under his eldest brother's tight rein. He's his own man, and he's determined to prove it―and himself―whatever the cost. Getting out of Texas has always been the plan, and now he's got the perfect excuse: driving herd to Wyoming where he can put down new stakes. It's dangerous, brutal, back-breaking work, but he's more than ready for the challenge. There's just one problem. Iris Richmond has been a thorn in the Randolph boys' side since she was a little girl. Fiercely independent, she's vowed to save her ranch by driving her own herd up the long and dusty trail―and Monty's just the man to help her get there. Monty swears he has no intention of taking Iris to Wyoming, but she's never taken no for an answer. As the two fight their way through impossible odds, they'll need to form an alliance that could impact the course of their lives forever. Previously published as Iris",
