  "description": "How to build a meaningful career with a moral center and a purpose in the worldSome of the world's most successful companies—Google, Disney, Starbucks—are not simply profit-driven, but purpose-driven. They identify the purpose behind why they do what they do, and let their \"why\" drive what they do every day. Nicholas Pearce argues that we all should do the same: discover our \"why\" and commit to the journey of aligning our daily work with our life's work. The Purpose Path is for people in any field who long to have more than just a job or a career, but a true vocation that allows them to connect their soul with their role. The Purpose Path is organized around five key questions: What is success? Who am I? Why am I here? Am I running the right race? Am I running the race well? Nicholas Pearce sits at the unconventional intersection of academia, business, and faith. With examples and advice, he shows how he and other people in a variety of fields and at different life stages have asked and answered these five questions in order to start, shape, or even radically change their careers. Inspiring, thought-provoking, and practical, The Purpose Path is an essential book for anyone who seeks the clarity and courage to advance their authentic life's work every day.",
