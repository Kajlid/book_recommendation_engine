  "description": "This unique, funny and inspiring book of poems documents the poet’s journey into greater and greater joy as she spends more time with her statue of the Laughing Buddha. “She practically dares the universe to bring her down, and it cannot do so. In poem after poem, laughter triumphs over whatever comes her way. It is a literate, knowing laughter,” that will set the reader “smiling, then laughing, then seeing, then smiling a deeper kind of smile.” Jane Marla Robbins is a National Endowment of the Arts Poetry Grant finalist.",
