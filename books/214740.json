  "description": "Lilly Perkins’ world has come crashing down around her. Her boyfriend is dead, and she must lean on her best friends, The Knights, in an effort to find herself again. Their journey takes them from the comforts of their small town of Barneveld, to anonymity of New York City. Along the bumpy road of healing, they all stumble, uncovering more questions that need answers. The Knights must determine who within their rival groups (The Shepherds and The Prestige) are friend or foe, all the while trying to figure out where they fit into a world that isn’t ready for their super powers. As the truth is unraveled, it seems that the Knights’ fates have already been determined. Like it or not, they will all be thrust into a war and all they can do is prepare for the worst.",
