  "description": "\"We'd better get out of here in a hurry,\" Jim said. Trixie nodded, unable to say anything.A rush and a roar of water followed the collapse of the bridge. About fifty or seventy-five feet from them, water swirled angrily. Big tree branches floated by out in the current, then the bloated body of a cow, and half a dozen chickens.\"Turn the car around as fast as you can,\" Honey urged, terrified. \"Oh, you can't turn around, Jim! There isn't any road anymore!\"",
