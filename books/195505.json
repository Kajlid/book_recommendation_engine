One wants to hurt me, the other seems to want to heal me, but there's more that he's after and I don't know if I can give him what he seeks.  Cash I was sent to find answers when no one else could find them. What I found was a woman in need and a psycho dealer working toward his own agenda. I wasn't to get involved, but her eyes call to me and I know they hold the information I seek.  Phil She doesn't think I'm good enough for her. But I'll show her. Hazel belongs to me and has since that night that I claimed her. I'll get back into her good graces. I have to. She has something of mine and I'm not stopping until I have it all.  *This book contains scenes of drug use, rape, and brutality. It is intended for readers over 18. Reader discretion is advised.",
