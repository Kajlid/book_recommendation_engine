  "description": "Helen Tanner lives alone and likes it that way. She runs her own business, spends her evenings out with friends, and tries to think as little as possible about the tragedy she has left behind. Until, that is, a dark-haired vet walks into her shop and into her life. Her first unpromising encounter with Llanelli vet Dai Evans turns into a tumultuous affair which brings about irrevocable changes for both of them. Dai becomes closer to his farming family, and helps them through the BSE crisis, while Helen is forced not only to consider a new future, but to face up to a troubled past.An intriguing and accomplished debut novel with that comparative rarity, a superb ending - Robert Nisbet, Western MailWell-written and thought-provoking, the book is definitely worth reading for an insight into human relationships, or simply as a great story â€“ Suzanne Oakley, Llanelli Star",
