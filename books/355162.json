  "title": "The Religious Subversion of Democracy",
  "description": "We have no evidence that there is any personal Superbeing who has anything to do with our lives. The best evidence we have is that we live in a universe of chance and probability, with physical laws that can describe only the interaction of large objects. The only god we know is the god of chance which chooses, by natural selection, those who have adapted to their environment, and unceremoniously, without remorse, eliminates those who do not adapt. If we accept this apparent fact, we will make entirely different decisions about how we manage our personal lives, and the structure of our societies. We will see that blind allegiance to the wild mythologies of our major religions is ripping apart the fabric of our societies. The religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam are schizophrenically bipolar. Until we realize we are blindly hating and killing each other on the basis of false myths, peaceful co-existence of all people will not be possible.",
