  "title": "Pihu: A Tale of Finding Meaning and happiness",
  "description": "What is happiness? Where can we find it? Is it in the innocent safety of our homes, or in the full exploration of our potential? Is it when we are alone, or when there are others around to share it with?This book is a tale of Pihu, the peacock. Pihu was not just any peacockâ€”he was special. He was the most beautiful dancer. Then how could he lead an ordinary life? Of what use would his talent be if it stayed hidden behind the forest greens?He found someone who took him out from the innocent but stagnant comfort of the forest to the scintillating glory of the stage where he could showcase his potential, push himself and grow better each day. But soon these glorious lights became chains that entangled him. He was throttled with despair, unable to move. He then found someone who gave him the keys to open his shackles, dance freely and enjoy the stage, the growth and the glory.Pihu learns what true happiness is and how he can find it and live it. This is his story, but it could very much be ours. May all of us find that happiness we seek.",
