  "description": "Alexandra Raker is starting her freshman year at Leighton-Prep, and living in her own perfect little world. She plans to rule the school with her best friend Camryn, and that shouldn't come difficult seeing as how she comes from the wealthiest, most powerful family in the small town of Leighton. Her fairy-tale quickly descends into a nightmare when she starts hanging out with kids from the wrong side of the tracks. After someone mistakens her for her deceased Aunt, some questions arise and Alex begins unraveling the Rakers' mysterious family history. With the assistance of her new friends; Kenzie and her bad-boy brother Karter, Alex is forced to learn the hard way that some secrets are meant to be kept. And that there's no loyalty among Leighton's royalty.",
