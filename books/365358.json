  "title": "Listening to Prozac",
  "description": "Since it was introduced in 1987, Prozac has been prescribed to nearly five million Americans. But what is Prozacâ€”a medication, or a mental steroid? A cure for depression, or a drug that changes personality? Reported to turn shy people into social butterflies and to improve work performance, memory, even dexterity, does Prozac work on character rather than illness? Are you using it \"cosmetically,\" to make people more attractive? More energetic, more socially acceptable? And what does it tell us about the nature of character and the mutability of self?",
