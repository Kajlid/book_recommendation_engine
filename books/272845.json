  "title": "Forty Whacks: New Evidence in the Life and Legend of Lizzie Borden",
  "description": "The Fall River, Massachusetts, murders of well-to-do Andrew Borden and his wife, Abby, are as fascinating to the audience of today as they were to those who followed the trial of Lizzie Borden -- the daughter accused of the murders.This vivid account gives a detailed picture of the nightmarish murder scene, the suspects, and the frenzied days when the nation hungered for news of the trial. Combining newly released evidence and extensive court transcripts, the author shows why there was insufficient evidence to prove Lizzie's involvement -- and why her jurors had no choice but to free her.",
