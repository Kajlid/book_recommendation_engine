  "description": "Relath Talasar is a wizard, not the scam artist Khat, the local sheriff, thinks he is. Mainly because Khat does not believe in wizards, or dragons, or magic of any kind. Belief in such things can put you in jail and practicing magic can actually get you executed. All Khat is trying to do is force Relath to leave town so he doesn't have to deal with it.But after coming to LockShire on the heels--or should he say tentacles?--of an evil Angel Walker, Relath has fallen hard for the lawman. Now not only does Relath have to protect the big dumb sheriff and defeat the Angel Walker, he also has to stay ahead of a colonel hell-bent on seeing him hang for the crime of being a wizard... Gay / Fantasy / Witchcraft / Magic / Shapeshifter / Action / Adventure / Suspense / Thriller / Romantic Comedy / BDSM (Light)",
