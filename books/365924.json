  "description": "This title is updated to include the release of their fifth studio album \"The Resistance\" and their 2009/2010 world tour. \"Out of This World\" is the definitive story of Muse and features thousands of words of exclusive, previously unprinted interview transcripts taken between 1998 and 2007 by author Mark Beaumont. Charting the bands stratospheric rise from a Battle of the Bands contest in Teignmouth to being the first band ever to sell out the new Wembley Stadium, Muse's story is one of UK rock's most fascinating and incendiary tales. This edition follows their every step from 16 year old punk kids to Wembley Stadium, featuring everyone of their albums and the wild nights, theories and falsettos they experienced along the way.",
