  "title": "A Bridge Too Far",
  "description": "Another classic WWII Book This book is a powerful and well documented account of Operation Marker Garden. Mr. Ryan gives a vivid desciption and analysis of why Monty's ambitious plan failed. He covers both sides of the story (Allies and Axis) at such great lengths that you almost feel as if you are right in the middle of the action yourself. The most compelling part of Mr. Ryan's book is his perspective of this disaster from the individual soldier level, both officer and enlisted. The drama that resulted from this opeartion, especially in Arnhem, will keep you turning the pages to find out what happens in the end. I definitely recommend this book for anyone who has read Mr. Ryan's other books (The Longest Day, The Last Battle), or has an interest in WWII, and airborne operations. The movie that was made based on this book is also a classic.",
