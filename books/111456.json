  "description": "Lifelong best friends Derrick and Jeremy met Hanna at a bar ten years ago. Both wanted her-one married her. Now the other man has been invited to join in for one hot weekend. Everything would've been fine if they'd had their fun that weekend, then gone back to normal. But they didn't. And when past demons resurface, things will never be the same-for any of them. Crossing the Line is a dark contemporary romance that contains explicit sex and mature situations.",
