  "description": "When new labor laws and environmental standards came to Europe, the ship-breaking industry and its associated environmental hazards moved to places with fewer regulations, such as Chittagong on the coast of Bangladesh. Buerk, a BBC correspondent, follows the demise of the Asian Tiger, one of many ships destroyed in the ship-breaking yards of Chittagong, and chronicles the lives of those who undertake this arduous and dangerous work.
