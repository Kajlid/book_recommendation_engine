  "description": "\"The sparks of attraction lead Ben and Olivia into distinctly unprofessional situations, while Olivia has to navigate the scars of her own past…a pleasant and gratifying read.\"\n ~Publishers Weekly Welcome home to the great place, a small town the home of America’s Army, where the men are strong and the women are tough enough to love them. Olivia Hale believes in following the process for one simple reason — the rules are simple and clear. Rules give her a sense of order and control in a life that has had anything but. She loves her job as an Army lawyer. And she’s definitely not interested in a fellow officer who has never met a rule he couldn’t break. Ben Teague has a way of getting under people’s skin — he’s hiding a painful past under a joking exterior, never taking anything too seriously. When he’s thrown into a job he’s spent his entire career avoiding, he’s got no choice but to become the thing he hates more than anything: someone who has to play by the rules. With everyone counting on Ben, he’ll have to make a choice…ignore the rules and risk losing everything including the one woman who dares to believe in him. Or find a way to follow them and maybe, along the way, follow them to an unexpected home. **previously published as It's Always Been You**",
