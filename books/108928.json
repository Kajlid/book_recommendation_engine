  "description": "February “Ary” Felina, an ocelot shifter with a weight complex, knows going out on her dirty thirty birthday is a bad idea, especially when she ends up in Charlie Wylde’s bed. The big, powerful alpha bear shifter is known in the town of Sweet Water for never having the same female twice. But that one-night stand turns into a disaster when the condom breaks.  When Charlie sees Ary for the first time he wants her. The bear in him needs to mark and claim her until everyone knows she is his. When she tells him she is pregnant and he’s the father, he has no choice but to step up and take care of her and his baby. It was only supposed to be that one night of pleasure, so when a jackal shifter comes sniffing around her, can Charlie show him that a bear always takes care of what’s his?",
