  "description": "Bella Breaux was having a pretty good day as a Property Manager in Orange Beach, Alabama. Her morning run was great and her day was moving along smoothly until the new owner showed up. Their personalities clashed in the first five minutes, but soon the sparks were flying.  This big cowboy made Bella’s engine roar. She had been so caught up in trying to get her writing career going, that a man was not in her future plans. Pete Morgan had a different plan for Ms. Bella Breaux. He had his own agenda. Moving on as a widow had become a priority number one and he hoped Bella could help him out.  As their relationship progressed she wondered if her independence, the fact that she had been in prison and he had been a District Attorney in Montana, or the crazy man trying to kill them would be the end of this unexpected world wind of a romance. This book is full of sarcasm and wit, but at times can pull at your heart a tad. It’s a little bit of everything with twists and unexpected turns. An easy and fun read.",
