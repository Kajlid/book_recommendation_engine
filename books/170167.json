  "description": "Never take home a stray unless you plan to keep him.  Dean is down on his luck with the ladies when he comes across a violent gay bashing in progress. When he saves twenty one year old Tommy from the thugs, the younger man is grateful and has no where to go.  Unwilling to you a young man freeze in the New York winter night, Dean takes the poor guy home to crash on his couch. He wasn't planning on keeping him, but when Dean wakes up to Tommy's gratitude he realizes that the young guy loves to be dominated, controlled, and trained.  Maybe having a pet around the house to serve Dean's needs wouldn't be the worst thing; but can he keep his heart from getting tangle up with this stray puppy?  This Erotic short contains graphic depictions of MM sex, including spanking, control, domination, and messy aftermath. Enjoy!",
