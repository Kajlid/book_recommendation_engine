Two women from disparate halves of this frightening future earth become entangled in an archaic conspiracy that threatens the existence of all of mankind.Peppermint is just like every other Denizen trapped inside the Utopian splendour of the Dome: hedonistic, self-centered, and utterly naive.

Peppermint must learn to control her power - or risk becoming a slave to the elite. Living under a harsh military dictatorship deep in the African savanna, life is a constant struggle for Jinx. But revenge fills this volatile soldier's mind. When the search for her mother's killer takes her into the center of a rival colony of Diggers, Jinx is faced with a terrifying decision. Her choice reins in the truth about her past and the depraved nightmare she’s unwittingly plunged herself into. While both women struggle with their new realities, Peppermint and Jinx must remain true to themselves while battling for mankind’s most valued human right: freedom.",
