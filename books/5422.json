  "description": "Do You Believe in Second Chances? \"Sometimes I think the universe must be very peculiar,\" she announced, drawing me from my rambling thoughts, \"that God might actually have a wicked sense of humor.\" Frances Thompson is a young, privileged Englishwoman, newly married to a war correspondent for The London Times. When he is sent to the French countryside at the outbreak of World War I, he agrees to take his young bride with him. That was his first mistake. When a brutal attack by a stranger compels them to leave for Dessau, Germany, Frances is befriended by Elsha, a young German woman, and Derek, a Belgian art student. These two people will challenge-and forever change-her preconceived notions of love, friendship and loyalty. Set against the dramatic landscape of both France and Germany during World War I, this haunting and romantic story pits the uncertainty and sacrifice of war against the enduring force of love. \"A story that is sweet, tender, and love (and life!) affirming.\" - Bill Kirton, author, The Figurehead, Material Evidence, Rough Justice, The Darkness \"Lowes paints her romance on a rich, European canvas. With each brush stroke, the reader becomes more entwined with each character.\" - Joann Keder, author, The Something That Happened in Pepperville",
