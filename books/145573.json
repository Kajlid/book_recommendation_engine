  "description": "Weight loss would be so incredibly easy, if only it weren't for those damn food cravings!  You really want to make some changes. You are serious about your commitments. But no matter how you restrict your diet, the desire to return to your old ways just won’t go away.  Then, your natural instincts kick in.  You try to fight these urges for your favorite foods. You desperately want to get rid of these thoughts. You just want to stop thinking about food all the time!  But it doesn't work. No matter how much you try to fight it, at the end of the day you simply lack the motivation, willpower, and self-discipline to get lasting results.  Now answer this.  What’s the difference between you and the guy who ran a marathon every day for 30 days in a row?  In a single word, training.  Yes, proper training makes the difference between barely making it out of a marathon alive, and being able to comfortably run it for 30 days in a row. The exact same thing is true with dieting.  This book won't teach you how to train your muscles. This book will teach you how to use powerful psychology to make any kind of changes to your diet. It will teach you how to stick to them for as long as YOU decide to.  You will not only learn how to deal with cravings. You will learn to eliminate them, to destroy them completely.  You will not only be able to survive a weight loss diet. You will be able to make it through without any of the usual struggles involved.  Weight loss is easy. But until you learn how to properly prepare your mind for it, I can guarantee you will continue to struggle.",
