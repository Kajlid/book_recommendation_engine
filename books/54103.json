  "description": "Come take a crazy ride down to the Buckeye state, where you will find a headstrong teenage girl named Anna, encounter a journey full of supernatural and crazy situations. Ripped away from her small hometown, Anna is forced to face and reveal happenings around every corner when she moves to Cleveland. Whether it's dealing with her young and crazy mother or encountering things making hostile noises in her bedroom. This haunting tale shows Anna that human society is more to hate than the supernatural and she may or may not have a dark hidden secret...or two. In a world where vampires and werewolves do not exist for once, join Anna on her whimsical adventure. An adventure where she'll release the judged and tormented supernatural, while head-butting with the shallow society we live in today...cops in particular. If you love stories that teach valuable lessons about diversity and accepting those who are different than others, you'll be in for a bloody treat.",
