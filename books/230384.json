  "description": "I’m Gabriel Stone. Half human. Half angel. And poker-playing badass.  Thrown outta Heaven for gambling sins, I’m forced to hunt demons on Earth for a living. So when a fat bounty for a fire demon turns up at the Angel Guild, I’m straight on the case.  But this isn’t any regular fire demon. He’s already wasted two half-angel bounty hunters and zapped a bunch of Russian mafia shifters. Only a master in dark arts could’ve raised such a powerful entity and they must’ve had a damn good reason.  Maybe it’s got something to do with the siren I won in a card game; the one with the magical powers no regular siren should possess. She’s got this demon all worked up in his mission to raise Hell and it’s my job to stop him.  I hope I haven’t bitten off more than I can chew.  Cause if I have, Hell itself will come to Earth. And that would not be cool.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Heart of Stone is the first book in an exciting new urban fantasy series. Take a trip with Gabriel Stone across a Chicago teeming with gangster vampires, cartel super werewolves, cranky fae kings and talking trees. If you’re a fan of authors such as Jim Butcher, Ilona Andrews or JA Cipriano, you’ll love Heart of Stone. Buy your copy today!",
