  "description": "Incognitoâ€™s \"submissive dominatrix,\" Angela Patterson, juggles separate love lives with two men who hold keys to her heart. Her wild side craves Garrett Storm. A sexy-as-sin hunk of a construction worker who is every submissives' dream. He's big, strong, rough, and domineering. Then there's sweet, gentle Blaine Worthington, a white-collar businessman with sophisticated tastes. He wines her and dines her, and in the bedroom will do anything and everything to please. For a while, they fulfill her every fantasy, but when each man demands more commitment, her two separate worlds collide, and the competition for her heart ignites.",
