  "title": "Flowers Foreplay Facelifts Flatulence: A humorous romp through the four stages of relationships.",
  "description": "We all experience the four stages of relationships. Many people experience these stages without any relationships. Children all start out equal. Boys and girls play with reckless abandon, knowing they have no one to impress. They just want to have a good time. As we reach puberty, men feel the need to impress women and begin by giving little gifts, like chocolates and flowers. Some are even willing to go so far as to fake foreplay just to impress women. Women at this stage know they are really in charge. As we begin to age, the pendulum swings the other way as women begin to feel a bit vulnerable and feel the need to get facelifts to remain desirable. Most men would not consider a facelift. Finally both sexes become equal again. Both sexes are completely comfortable with themselves and just want to play (or nap) with reckless abandon. They know flatulence is just a bodily function (although men have known this from birth).",
