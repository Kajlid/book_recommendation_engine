  "title": "Wander Woman: How High-Achieving Women Find Contentment and Direction",
  "description": "After years of coaching high-achieving women, master coach and personal development expert Marcia Reynolds started noticing something many of the clients with whom she worked were plagued by anxiety over their own restless responses to the world. Â These women were jumping jobs regularly, defining and redefining their relationship with the marketplace, constantly questioning their roles as wives and mothers and sisters.Dubbing her subjects \"wander women,\" Reynolds found that the mentoring and personal development resources currently available don't address this audience's needs. They don't want to balance their lives; they want to find peace of mind in the chaos. They don't necessarily want to learn how to gain a seat in the boardroom; they want projects they can run with or businesses they can run on their own. The problem isn't their level of stress; it's about knowing who they are and what they want to accomplish in this one lifetime.Wander Woman explores how generational shifts and changing expectations of working women have fostered a new kind of restlessness among many. Through real-life stories she reveals the hopes and dreams, disappointments and challenges this group of high-achieving women are facing. And, most importantly, she provides exercises and development strategies for readers as they make their journey to peace and finally come to rest with a strong sense of identity and purpose.",
