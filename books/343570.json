  "description": "Myka can spot an ant carrying a crumb in a faraway field. She can see an inchworm sliding along a twig in a distant wood. She’s a brave-hearted, sharpeyed fairy scout. Then one morning Myka thinks she spots something dangerous and sounds an alarm—a false alarm. Now Myka’s no longer so sure of herself. She’s starting to think something is wrong with her eyes, but she doesn’t want anyone to know. Can Myka count on her other senses to help her fool everyone?",
