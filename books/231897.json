  "description": "As the Galactic Cold War continues, the threat of a new Soviet weapon unveils an even darker danger\n \nNo home, no family and only faded memories of the life she lost. After the rebellion destroyed New Hong Kong and left Jiang Chen with a brain injury, she found a new place to belong aboard the Mombasa as its pilot. But after discovering she poses a danger to ship and crew, Jiang leaves, not wanting to risk causing them more harm. Security chief Ryder Kalani blames himself for the mission failures plaguing the Mombasa—his sole duty is to protect his crew. Having lost his right arm in the rebellion and now fit with a prosthetic, he's unsure whether he's still the capable fighter he once was. The only thing he knows for certain is that Lieutenant Jiang Chen needs his help. Jiang doesn't trust herself anymore, but Ryder does. They're on the hunt for the Soviets' new weapon, and Jiang's forgotten past could lead them straight to it. Ryder just needs to get Jiang to trust in herself—and in him—before the weapon deploys.  \nBook two in The Galactic Cold War series \n\n \nThis book is approximately 65,000 words  \nOne-click with confidence.
