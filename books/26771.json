  "description": "YOU THINK YOU’VE HEARD MY STORY BEFORE…At twenty-seven, I’m too young to be a widow. I’m trying my best to start over though: new city, new job running my own little shop. I try to fade into the background where I can, but the police won’t let me disappear completely. There are too many unanswered questions about the night my husband died.YOU THINK YOU KNOW ME…I even have a new lodger, Elizabeth. She’s friendly, but definitely not a friend. Beautiful, too – tall and slim with the sort of swishy blonde hair I’ve always coveted. She smiles at me when we pass on the stairs. It occurs to me then that I don’t know the first thing about her.…BUT YOU’RE SO, SO WRONG.If I were to tell you what happened to us next, you wouldn’t believe me. You might believe Elizabeth – she’s the type who people trust – until it’s too late.I guess you’ll have to find out for yourself.If you read one book this year, make it this one. A tense, gripping psychological thriller for anyone who raced through The Girl Before, Behind Her Eyes, or The Girl on the Train.",
