  "description": "It wasn’t that long ago that the world we live in was run differently. Some of the past still surrounds us, but is much less prevalent. The world of which I speak was controlled by money and power. Those who had it suppressed the weak and poor. The suppressed had no choice but to abide by the suppression. This show of power existed in every aspect of life, from love to war. During this time, bias and prejudice were ways of life. The wealthy did as they pleased. They married to keep status. This still happens today, but not to the same extent. Many were forced to learn to love, rather than be free to find it as were the poor. The poor could find their mate, rather than be forced into an arranged marriage. Love and life were very much dependent on the class into which you were born. This book is the story of a man, who wished to be his own man. He knew his place in this world wasn’t what was given or laid out before him. Jacque wished to make his own way. During his exploits, he found himself on foreign and biased soil. This is where his life would change; it would begin. He fell in love with a woman he was forbidden to marry. Their love for each other carried them to places neither of them thought possible, both good and bad. This is a story not just about love, but life. Unfortunately, it is honest and true, for life is filled with as much happiness as it is pain. Here is Jacque, a Frenchman, who loved Elizabeth, an Englishwoman, and their story.",
