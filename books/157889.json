  "description": "This book will dig out the master planner that has been hiding inside of you, and who is hungry for getting things done and having fun while doing it. It’s ironic how much time and energy we dedicate to figuring out how to plan an entertaining evening out, how to make our one-week trip to an exotic place unforgettable or how to make others feel bad for things they’ve done to us or, yet when it comes to figuring out how to make our life easier, better and happier, we tend to put any sort of planning aside.",
