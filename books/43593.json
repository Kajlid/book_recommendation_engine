  "description": "Renee thought she had gone through the worse nightmare thought possible, but little did she know that more danger lurked in every shadow. Her intentions were to go back to Cuba and fulfill a promise made to ‘the two’ that helped her escape an unbelievable hell. What she discovers on her return, changes her destiny and places her on a path that could only be imagined by the morbidly insane. Many questions remain… will she be able to fulfill the needs that have taken hold of what little heart she has left? Can the faith of a country girl turned breeder, with the help of those who would follow her into hell itself… be enough? Or will they find themselves in a situation that no one could get them out of?",
