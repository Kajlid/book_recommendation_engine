  "title": "Sphere: The Form of a Motion",
  "description": "\"There wasn't one page of his poem that didn't delight me.\"―Donald Davie, New York Review of Books Sphere is the second of A. R. Ammons's long poems―following Tape for the Turn of the Year and preceding Garbage ―that mark him as a master of this particular form. The sphere in question is the earth itself, and Ammons's wonderfully stocked mind roams globally, ruminating on subjects that range from galaxies to gas stations. It is a remarkable achievement, comparable in importance to Wallace Stevens's Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction .",
