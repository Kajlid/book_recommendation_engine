  "title": "The Case of the Sulky Girl",
  "description": "Frances Celane is unable to marry due to a stipulation in her late father's will, which states that, although she is his only child, she will lose his millions if she does wed. Headstrong, she hires Perry Mason to get around the clause. Complications arise, and he soon finds himself deep into a family murder. Too deep perhaps?\"Sulky Girl\" is #2 in the successful Perry Mason series, but it's a first in one category. \"The Case of the Velvet Claws,\" #1, did not contain a courtroom drama. In #2, for the first time, Mason illustrates his ability to drive the judge and the prosecuting attorney crazy. Now that's the Perry Mason we know and love.",
