  "description": "I thought that going after those who'd destroyed my life would help me move on. At the very least, that it would ease the thirst for vengeance singing in my blood. I was wrong.\nWith my guns at my side, I continue to search for ways to punish the one man who took everything from me. The man who killed my family. Death is far too good for him.I want to make him suffer, to take from him everything he loves.To that end, I need a code breaker, one who deals in magical glyphs. But in the hunt for her, I discover there are far more secrets to my life, and my blood, than I ever could have imagined.Secrets that are burning their way out of the past and the shadows.A promise dangled in front of me by the enemy of my enemy is too sweet to ignore. And I will cast all my cards on the table for the one chance that the promise he offers is true.That my son is alive.God help those who stand between my boy and me.",
