  "description": "\"Christmas! 'Tis the season for kindling the fire of hospitality in the hall, the genial fire of charity in the heart.\"No holiday has the power to captivate our senses or dominate our memories quite like Christmas. And perhaps no contemporary artist has the power to captivate our imaginations quite like Thomas Kinkade. His tranquil, light-infused paintings evoke a world where love, faith, family, and home provide guiding lights for life. In this enchanting book, Kinkade's luminous paintings are accompanied by inspired and joyful words about Christmas from some of history's greatest writers, poets, and thinkers. The Light of Christmas will shine as a family tradition for years to come.Copyright 2005 Thomas Kinkade, The Thomas Kinkade Company, Inc., Morgan Hill, CA",
