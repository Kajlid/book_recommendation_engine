  "description": "A devastating EMP. No power. No communication. And no help...On the five-year anniversary of his wife Hannah's disappearance, small-town deputy Noah Sheridan takes his young son Milo to a local ski resort for some much needed father-son time. In a blink, the power grid goes out. So do the resort's brand new generators. Noah and Milo find themselves trapped on a chairlift thirty feet above the ground.  Help is not on the way. Night is coming, and with it the killing cold. Getting down before hypothermia sets in is only the beginning... When an impending blizzard cuts off the town from the rest of civilization, it'll take everything Noah has to keep his family and friends alive. The only things more dangerous than mother nature's wrath are the desperate people willing to do anything to survive. Don't miss the second book in the riveting post-apocalyptic EMP thriller series, Edge of Collapse.
