  "description": "Sixteen-year-old boy crazy Kacey Jones thinks geometry and biology are boring compared to more interesting things, like boys. When she is put in educational support for her suffering grades, she is paired with the most annoying know-it-all boy in the entire school. The smartest boy in the senior class, Jack Landry. When she really wants to be in study hall flirting with her current boyfriend, she’s stuck studying with Jack. He forces her to work when she wants to be on her phone. He also has the nerve to call her out on her dating habits, not being able to keep a boyfriend. But as time goes on, it seems as if her tutor-tutee relationship with Jack is the longest one she’s had with a boy. When her feelings become more, will she run like she always does, or will she listen to her heart and finally allow herself to love?",
