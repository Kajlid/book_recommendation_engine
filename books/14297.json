  "description": "The Times Top 5 Thriller Novel of 2011.  Past, present and future collide head on in a unique and twisting thriller.  A naked male, dead in an alleyway with bullets that don’t make sense. A note, written in 13th Century Latin secreted about his person along with the name and room number of an autistic mental patient. Fingerprints burned away and tattoos completely removed. Of all the possible duties, the last task LAPD detective Nick Lambert wanted was the drive to Oakdene to interview the girl. It gets much worse when he discovers that as well as being autistic, she’s also mute.  But when an off-hand comment from the nurse piques Nick’s attention, he can’t help but follow the lead. What he finds will turn his entire world - his entire existence - upside down. Clues to the location of valuable stone tablets, the only tablets described in Exodus as being ‘written by the hand of God’. These are not the Ten Commandments… these are ALL the commandments, and Nick suddenly finds himself at the heart of a centuries old struggle to find, and hide, the kind of extremely valuable information that mankind was never meant to possess.  It is only when Nick realises that he was a key player in the game long before it started, and that he will be a key player long after it is over, will he discover the true importance of those around him.  Nick has inadvertently stumbled into the most important human being who has ever lived. One who will not only change the world once, but will do it over and over again.  He will discover many things about the girl.  What she has to hide is the most important thing of all.",
