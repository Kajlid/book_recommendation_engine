  "description": "The name of the doll was Lady Vanderbilt, and she was very beautiful. Her gown was of lavender taffeta, and around her neck she wore a pearl. When Ginnie and Geneva heard about her, they longed to see her, but the doll had disappeared thirty years ago and no one knew where she was. Then, suddenly, she appeared at a church auction, and for a tantalizing moment the girls thought she would be theirs. But a twist of fate took her away once more, and it required all Ginnie's ingenuity and determination to find the doll and solve her mystery.",
