  "title": "Sean Rafferty: Collected Poems",
  "description": "The poetry of the Scottish writer Sean Rafferty's has been a well-kept secret over four decades. Concentrating on his life and his art, he was hardly noticed until 1973 when a small Grosseteste selection appeared. A decade later his poems were featured in PN Review, submitted not by the poet but by an admirer, Ted Hughes. Later still, two small selections were published. In the year before his death he agreed that Carcanet could publish his Collected Poems. This book includes the only interview he ever conceded, with his editor the poet Nicholas Johnson.",
