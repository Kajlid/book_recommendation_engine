He lives with chaos as a constant companion, that is, until he meets Avery, a cat shifter who quiets the demons inside of him and shines light into Rez's dark world. When Avery mysteriously disappears, it's up to Rez to find his mate. He tracks down his mate who is in the clutches of the same man who tortured him all those years ago. Worse, Avery is dying and Jaden shows up to claim his soul, but Rez isn't giving his mate up so easily, not when Avery is carrying his child. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
