  "description": "Leo is haunted by the ghosts of his lost platoon.  Having lost his entire platoon years ago from an ambush, Leo Graves hasn't been able to overcome the immense sense of guilt he feels about surviving. The only solace he finds in the civilian world is his position of VP in the Lima Six Motorcycle Club--a 1% club made up entirely of former veterans on the small border town of Vallecito de Grande.   Jamie is more than just another girl associated with the club.  Tough as nails and the sister of an active duty Marine, Jamie Boyles supplements her income by helping the MC launder much of its illicit profits through her bar. Never one to back down from a challenge, she understands exactly the kind of danger that both her and the club faces from across the border.   When the club's conflict across the border reaches a dangerous breaking point, Leo knows it's only a matter of time before Jamie is caught in the cross-fire.   With the cartel's ruthless reputation for going after any and all loved ones of their enemies, Leo is determined to keep Jamie safe. But will the ghosts of his past return to haunt him or is there still a sliver of hope for love to prevail? How far is either of them willing to go to keep each other safe?",
