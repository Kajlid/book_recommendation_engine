  "title": "Separate Little War: The BANFF Coastal Command Strike Wing Versus the Kreigsmarine and Luftwaffe 1944 - 1945",
  "description": "Every day for nine months from September 1944, young British Commonwealth and Norwegian airmen flew from Banff, Fraserburgh and Peterhead in northern Scotland to target German U-boats, merchant men and freighters in the fjords and leads of southwest Norway, encountering the Luftwaffe and flakships every step of the way. Truly this was a war within a war, bitter and bloody, at low level and close quarters. By recording their crucial contribution to winning the world war, in a compelling, accurate and fascinating way, Andrew Bird has ensured their memory will not be overlooked.",
