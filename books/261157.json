  "description": "Ever since I can remember, poetry has been part of my life. The words and the flow come easily to me, like the rhythm of the music.It brings me immense joy in happy times and soothes me, even in the darkest nights of the soul.It is my constant companion; my words pour out on the page almost as quickly as they are created in my brain.We all have a dark side, but there is a balance in us. Mine manifests in ink rather than deed.If I can write poetry, you can do it too. You don't need a captive audience; you don't even need to have talent. The most important thing is that you write it for yourself; you don't need to share it with anyone if you don't want to. All you must do is, to be honest, use your love, use your pain in your writing.Words are healing; they can be a tool to release negativity inside when you make them manifest on a page.Do not fear to walk in the darkest of places; You will be a beacon of hope in the caverns and the shadows.",
