  "description": "Elen McNally is arrogant, intelligent and gorgeous. She's also desperate for a ticket out of Aroostook County, Maine. Signing on for a hitch in the Army, she quickly discovers that life for a woman in the military can be brutal. At first believing that relationships with men will ease her path, a violent confrontation leads to the surprising, welcom discovery that other women can be friends...and more.  Transformed by living inside and outside the rigid requirements of Army life, Elen finds that while she cannot speak of her love for women, it is a thin fire running through her heart and her life. Returning home to the peace and beauty of the Maine woods, there is another mystery to that the complement of loving is being loved.  Unforgettable women populate this vivid, provocative and sexy book from the author of The Grass Widow.  Originally published in 1993 by MadWoman Press.",
