  "description": "FIRE CANOE FINNEGAN is historical fiction, action, adventure, and romance at its finest. This story gives a rare insight into the contribution steamboats made to pioneers and army forts along the Missouri River. Captain Glazer, of the steamboat, The Dakota Dawn, hires Clint Finnegan to become his second in command and to learn to pilot the dangerous snag-filled waters of the Missouri River. What Finnegan didnâ€™t expect on his very first trip was to have the army payroll stolen and a beautiful woman kidnapped. Risking his life, he chases after the girl and the money, ultimately encountering angry plains Indians protecting their hunting grounds. Told from both the Sioux Indian point of view and that of conquering whites who wanted the land at all costs, this is a thrilling western tale. Filled with strong characters, the reader will walk away mesmerized with a well-researched and well-told story.",
