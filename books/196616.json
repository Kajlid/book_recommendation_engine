  "description": "Poetry. Poetry is what ties the threads of world together. Poetry is the balm that soothes our burns. Poetry is what binds love with lust, for where would one be without the other? Poetry is what gives words to what you're afraid to say. Sreesha Divakaran's second collection of poetry, Wine, Fire, Satin, Dew explores these threads through 29 poems - intoxication, passion, sadness, love, loneliness, togetherness, despair. Savour these poems with all your senses. Let go of reality.",
