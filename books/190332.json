  "description": "\"Cougar's Gift\" is the third book Pacific Northwest Cougars series.Communicating with others didn’t require the use of a lot of words in Stryker’s mind. He was a man and a cougar…what more needed to be explained. But when the fates give you a mate that needs to be talked into forever a cougar needs to man up and start talking. Tucked away in her tiny town, Libby was happy with her job at the library, her epic book collection, and her kooky parents. Until one day a mystery man rides into her little world on the back of a motorcycle. Libby knows all about sex and love in romance novels, now she has to figure out how that translates to real life. A rough biker shifter and a sweet innocent librarian find that a new world of passion can open up with the turn of a page. Prepare to read about a hot grunting shifter who has to convince the shy librarian that he’s not only her mate, but the right man to be her first. There may not be enough sage and crystals to enlighten this cougar. Intended for readers 18+ as adult material with sexual situations and language",
