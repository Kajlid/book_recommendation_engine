  "description": "Hello blog!It's the start of another term and there are three things that SUCK about my life:1. I am STILL sharing a bedroom with my step-brother Gav (AKA Shrek's stinkier twin).2. My mum is 6 months pregnant and therefore cabbage-kickingly MENTAL.3. I'm about to have a high speed rail line (i.e. brace) installed in my gob! The only non-sucky thing is that I've got a GIRLFRIEND! A real one! Who actually wants to SNOG me!!! The problem is her dad officially HATES MY GUTS and is determined to make my life a LIVING HELL. Oh, and this smarmy loser called Seb is trying to steal her off me with his rubbish DJ skills.There's just one thing for it - me and my best mates Harry and Ad are going to have to enter the same DJ competition as Seb and WIN!What could POSSIBLY go wrong? The hilarious sequel to The Private Blog of Joe Cowley.",
