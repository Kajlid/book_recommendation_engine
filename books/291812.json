  "description": "My name is Tamsin Vale, and I survived my first semester at Artemis University… And several Biblical plagues. Of all the things I’d been expecting, plagues weren’t one of them. We still don’t know who the culprit was or if it was simply a prank, so there’s possibly another threat out there against me.Add it to the list.Unfortunately, that damn list is getting long.But despite all of that, I think I’m getting the hang of this college thing. I like my classes, I’m doing well in them, and I’m making progress on also finishing high school. I have some normal in my completely crazy life with friends, a boyfriend, and typical worries someone my age should have.Granted, I’m still sleeping with my professor and a dragon prince, while trying to save all fairies, fair folk, and Faerie, but also help my friends and women in an extremely sexist society that treats them like property and fight the corruption of the councils. That should be enough to keep a woman busy for the rest of her life.It should have been… Except there’s a serious problem the dragons are facing, and they need my help. The lives of millions are at stake, so as much as I want to only focus on my people and my problems, they might have to wait a little bit longer.This will definitely end with more threats against me.Artemis University is an ongoing hot burning reverse harem, university-age paranormal academy series with darker elements, strong language, violence, and a heroine who follows her own moral compass of what is right… And who she ends up giving her heart to.",
