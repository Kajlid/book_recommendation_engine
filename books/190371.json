  "title": "Not Working",
  "description": "For fans of HBO’s Girls , Bridget Jones’s Diary and Where’d You Go, Bernadette? , a laugh-out-loud, irreverent debut novel about a woman trying—not to have it all—but to figure it all out. Twenty-something Londoner Claire has just resigned from her job without a plan—and although she is pleased, her family and friends can't seem to understand. Before too long, she manages to push away both her safe, steady, brain-surgeon boyfriend and her difficult but loving mother.      Quirky, questioning Claire hilariously navigates and comments on the emotions and minutiae of day-to-day life as only someone without the distractions of a regular routine can. Brilliantly observed, touching and wildly funny, Not Working is the story of a life unraveling and a novel that skewers the questions that have been keeping us all awake at night.",
