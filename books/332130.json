I'm living with Diego and his son, desperately trying to forget how right it felt to be on my knees for him and how badly I crave to hear more of his praise.Except Diego doesn't forget. All day I take care of his son, and every hot summer night, he takes care of me. He tells me I'm perfect. Beautiful. Sexy.I want to belong to Diego Garza in every way. But he hasn't asked me to stay when this job is over at the end of summer.The question is...when I'm not his nanny anymore, will I still be his?",
