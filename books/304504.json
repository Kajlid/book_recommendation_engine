  "description": "President Lyndon Johnson distrusts the Russians and sneaks a scientist into Siberia to examine hidden mines. He discovers the Russians working on a deadly bacteria to sneak into the United States. But where and how? The Russians go undetected until the people on the Hill, on the edge of Philadelphia, begin acting strangely. They no longer needed to sleep. People 80 felt like 20 and thought they'd found the fountain of youth. But four rugged kids on the Hill trying to accomplish their first winning baseball season begin noticing signs that things weren't right. The parts started falling into place when an Irish grandmother from Drumcondra, Ireland, who spoke to the dead and two clever detectives, and yes, the four hard-bitten and resilient Hill kids, go after the Russians. Another unputdownable in the On the Hill Series.",
