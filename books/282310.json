  "description": "\"I felt his eyes corrupting me from the inside out. Felt them burning on my retinas like I was looking into the sun—a pitch-black sun. His left arm lifted upwards and pointed at me like he was transferring all blame onto me. As if to say I was the one who caused this, and I was the one who wanted this to happen.\"Key has been trying to pick up the pieces after the death of his young daughter from an accident on the beach—A day meant for fun, instead opened the door to a realm Key deemed unimaginable.As he lifted her up from the sand, his wife Susan stood before him, tears streaming down her face. The image of the woman he found to be the most beautiful in the world, would forever haunt him.And that was when he met him, Deyn, a small boy with blond hair and piercing eyes. With an ambiguous smile, he made Key a promise. A promise he meant to keep until the end. At the time, Key even interpreted it as a caring one.That was a mistake.",
