  "description": "These stories are funny! The 29 Turnbuckle tales offered here mix black humor with formula” crime stories in a hilarious twist to the hard-boiled detective tale.\nTurnbuckle’s cockeyed reconstructions of a murder exasperate his logical and long-suffering sidekick, Ralph, but they lead to a solution anyway -- most of the time. Turnbuckle may or may not know whodunit but he’s always confident that there will soon be another murder.",
