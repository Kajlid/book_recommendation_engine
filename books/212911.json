  "description": "This is an anthology of 25 stories, mostly first published from 1991-2001 in Dreams & Visions, a Canadian-based Christian literary journal (which Stanton also edits), all by Christian authors and all representing the realm of speculative fiction in its broadest definition.\"The anthology mixes modern themes - genetic engineering, android rights, and artificial intelligence - with new twists on old standbys like time travel and vampires. The stories are thought-provoking and often powerful. Together they make for eye-opening and heart-felt writing.\" - Faith Today",
