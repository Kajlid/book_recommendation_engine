  "title": "The Eye of Erasmus: Erasmus the Omnipotent",
  "description": "'The Eye of Erasmus' is the first of a series of four inter-related fables about time and fate, told in Teresa Geering's characteristic hypnotic prose. It tells of Erasmus, a baby born during a thunder storm, who is clearly destined to be special, with his flashing black eyes and haughty ways, until he finds love. The trouble is that the girl literally ‘of his dreams’ hasn't actually been born yet. No problem …… Oh, but there is ……. Danger lurks …….. \"'The Eye of Erasmus' is a tale gently and beautifully told. Like the Harry Potter novels, it is a book that readers of all ages will enjoy. It is definitely a book that I will read again and again,\" George Polley, author of 'The Old Man & The Monkey' and 'Grandfather and the Raven'.",
