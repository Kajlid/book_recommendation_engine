  "description": "When we read a novel, all the characters in it are suppose to be fictitious; and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, must be entirely coincidental, right? But what if one day you find a Novel and when you start reading it, you feel that you know the characters in it? You feel that you are familiar with the incidences in it. Will it be just a coincidence...?Sometimes some people come in our life, they live and then leave, with a hole in our soul, which we can feel but can't fill, we try to survive but end up DeadAlive.",
