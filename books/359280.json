  "description": "USA TODAY bestselling author Kathryn Springer brings holiday cheer in this festive story about fresh starts and unexpected love blooming on a snow-covered Christmas tree farm.It's three weeks until Christmas, and Lucy Gable is not in the holiday spirit. She’s the assistant to bestselling romance author Brynn Dixon, who’s been suffering from major burnout. Hoping to reduce Brynn’s stress, Lucy’s organized an intimate book tour—one that includes a charming little Christmas tree farm. And they're still hoping that no one discovers that Lucy was the one who finished writing Brynn’s last book…But Lucy’s carefully planned book tour is going completely awry. The Christmas tree farm owner is a reluctant host, the fans are going wild for the changes Lucy’s made to the book and Brynn’s adult son—who no one else knows about—is an unexpected (if handsome) distraction. And, as if those challenges aren’t enough, a winter storm at the farm is ensuring that hiding the truth is all but impossible.Yet somewhere between snowy sleigh rides, a cozy bonfire, caroling and the promise of new love, Lucy is experiencing her first winter wonderland. And Brynn is discovering that it might not be too late to find her own happy ending. With a little courage and a sense of adventure, it might just be the start of whole new chapters for both of them—and an accidentally perfect white Christmas.",
