  "description": "Corin’s back and now he has a job and a little money. Life is good, but when are things ever that simple?Recovering from injuries sustained on his last repair job, he is offered the chance to travel, to leave Tyler’s city, his home, and see a little more of the world under the oceans. An easy job, easy money and a bit of rest, nothing can go wrong.“Nothing’s really changed since we left the surface and came to live beneath the waves. The rich get richer and the poor struggle to get by. Those with money escape justice and those with none feel the full wrath of the law. There has to be a better way and, one day, I hope someone finds it. Until they do, I’ll keep my head down, my fists up and live a simple life. Beer, whiskey, work and sleep. Rinse and repeat till death.” – Corin Hayes.",
