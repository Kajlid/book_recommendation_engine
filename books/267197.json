  "title": "Tequila Rose",
  "description": "He tasted like tequila and the fake name I gave him was Rose.Four years ago, I decided to get over one man, by getting under another. A single night and nothing more. I found my handsome stranger with a shot glass and charming but devilish smile at the end of the bar. The desire that hit his eyes the second they landed on me ignited a spark inside me, instant and hot. He was perfect and everything I didn’t know I needed. That one night may have ended, but I left with much more than a memory. Four years later, and with a three-year-old in tow, the man I still dream about is staring at me from across the street in the town I grew up in. I don’t miss the flash of recognition, or the heat in his gaze. The chemistry is still there, even after all these years. I just hope the secrets and regrets don’t destroy our second chance before it’s even begun.",
