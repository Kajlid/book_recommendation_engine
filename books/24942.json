  "title": "That Sik Luv",
  "description": "Fornication is a sin. As it reads, we should flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. They teach us that these thoughts, these actions, are immoral. But that dark side that lives inside all of us, the true nature of man, drives us to seek the need that burns within, demanding to be set free. Deep inside of our bones lies that intrinsic need, one desperate to escape. An innate behavior, seemingly out of our control. One that screams for sins they tell us are condemning. Aero is the throat from which I scream. The dark parts of myself I want hidden from this world are all he sees when he gazes at me beneath yet another mask. He’s the demon drowning me in my own underlying desires. He may never stop. Not until I succumb to my truths, or die beneath the weight of his unrelenting grasp. Because according to him, the life I’ve been living is a hell far worse than death.",
