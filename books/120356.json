  "title": "My Dear Boy, Jack - Fate Took, God Gave.",
  "description": "Told largely through recently uncovered letters from the 1930s written by a boy crippled with polio. This true story develops into the life journey of one who would not allow his disability to define who he was; as a boy, through his adulthood, and into his last years. He gave back and back again. He got up - time and time again. He served others - over and over again. This boy, Jack T. Harris, Sr., listened and learned from the one he sent those letters to - Dr. George Washington Carver. Each letter Carver sent back to Harris began with, \"My Dear Boy, Jack.\" The treasures inside this book, which include many letters from the famous and not so famous, provide a path of servant leadership at its best - all taught through the words of a small disabled boy trying to make good with his life. He did! My Dear Boy, Jack is Book I of the Leadership for the Soul Series.",
