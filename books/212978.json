  "title": "The Old English Elegies: A Critical Edition and Genre Study",
  "description": "The nine elegies have all been edited separately between 1933 and 1983. Klinck builds on the extensive previous scholarship in the field and also draws on recently available materials - notably the microfiche Concordances, the first letters of the new Old English Dictionary, and Bruce Mitchell's Old English Syntax - to make new suggestions about problematic words and passages. Going beyond an exploration of the literary potential of individual poems, Klinck examines them as separate manifestations of a common generic impulse: she moves from palaeographical and philological detail to broader literary and cultural considerations and, finally, to a definition of Old English elegy.",
