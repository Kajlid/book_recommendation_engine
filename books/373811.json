  "description": "Introducing New York PI Jack Dooney. Boyhood friends move on after Regis High Sal to the family business, Billy to law, and Jack to private investigation after a stint in the NFL. A simple errand for Billy sets Jack off on the race of his life through the streets, bridges, penthouses, subways, offices, churches, and bars in every borough of the city. Jack s loyalty is soon tested but never waivers. Calling on an improbable and outrageous assortment of local characters and his own ability to bluff, charm, and think fast, Jack perseveres for answers he may not want. Knowing the City as only a lifelong New Yorker can, he plays it to his advantage especially since the bad guys are just boys from another neighborhood. Wickedly funny and occasionally poignant, Neighborhood Boys Who Ran is a raucous, energetic tale of what a man can do in size thirteen gazelles.",
