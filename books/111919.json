  "title": "Moments of Being",
  "description": "Virginia Woolf's only autobiographical writing is to be found in this collection of five unpublished pieces. Despite Quentin Bell's comprehensive biography and numerous recent studies of her, the author's own account of her early life holds new fascination---for its unexpected detail, the strength of its emotion, and its clear-sighted judgment of Victorian values.   Editor's Note and Introduction -- Reminiscences -- A Sketch of the Past -- The Memoir Club 22 Hyde Park Gate; Old Bloomsbury; [and] Am I a Snob? -- Appendix -- Index.",
