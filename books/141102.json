  "title": "Exquisite Trouble",
  "description": "This is the first book in the Iron Horse MC series, with Swan and Smoke's story . . .Before I met Smoke I'd never been kissed, really kissed, by a man, let alone a biker sex god bent on taking my virginity and my heart. I got dragged into the deadly world of the Iron Horse MC by my crazy twin sister who is engaged to the club's President and even crazier mom who only cares about herself. Smoke has been assigned by the club to keep me safe even though he's everything that I should be afraid of. He's the kind of man who lives by his own rules and does whatever he wants whenever he wants, but he treats me like I'm something rare and precious, not a socially dysfunctional basket case who has no idea how to love, but needs him more than her next breath.  Not that my feelings matter, because if we don't find my mother soon, the only thing I'll have to be worried about is who is going to kill me first.*-*NOTE: This book, \"Exquisite Trouble\" is the first part of two, telling the story of Swan and Smoke, with a 'Happy For Now' ending.
