  "description": "Time Limits is the first of the Marc McKnight time travel adventure stories.Time Limits is Somewhere in Time meets Timecop. Time Limits is a story about time travel, a murder mystery, and a man's obsession with the one woman he can't have. What if much of what you have read about time travel is wrong? In 1985, a corporate executive was murdered in an Atlanta office tower and the case never solved.  Fifty years later, a powerful US Senator pressures a team of experts to use newly developed but limited Time Travel technology to investigate the murder. Army officer Marc McKnight travels back in time to observe the event and bring back the answers, but he barely arrives in the past before he modifies history by distracting an attractive young security guard from a life-changing event.  With the help of his support team, he struggles to set things right and complete his mission, but further exposure to the woman creates more severe wrinkles in time. McKnight must now race against time to solve the murder and correct history.",
