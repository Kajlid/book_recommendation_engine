  "description": "In 1980, Rosie Ruiz ran one of the top times in the New York City Marathon by secretly taking the subway! In 1844, a balloon crossed the Atlantic in an unprecedented three days, an invention of a sales hungry newspaperman. And in 1915, Fritz Kreisler became one of America's best known violinists, playing little known works by composers like Vivaldi, which Kreisler wrote himself. This huge volume spotlights fakers, phonies, and hoaxters, in stories illustrated by a wide variety of cartoonists.",
