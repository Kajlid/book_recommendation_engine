In general, we have tried to avoid jargon derived from specific traditions and attempted to keep historical and background information to a minimum, while striving to provide clear behavioral instructions for developing specific, concrete skills. This is a book about how to do things. We have tried to make it as difficult as possible for you to reject the material in this book out of prejudice against one tradition or another. If we have been successful, you will see that the only way truly to evaluate the practices in this book is to try them for yourself.The EBook version of The Book of Good Practices is divided up into three volumes:Volume I: Learning Mindfulness and Self-AwarenessIntroductionAttention: Observances and AbstentionsRelaxation and StretchesMetabolism and FastingBreathingSense WithdrawalConcentrationAttention II – MindfulnessLoving Kindness and Compassion MeditationsAppendix I – Suggested Programs of StudyAppendix II –Additional ResourcesAbout the AuthorsVolume II: Neurological Skills for Well-Being and ExcellenceIntroductionChanging HabitsBeliefs and ValuesDecision Making and Goal SettingMaintaining and Improving Brain FunctionHemispheric ExercisesPeripheral VisionPain Control TechniquesLearning and Mnemonic TechniquesDreaming and Dream WorkAppendix I – Suggested Programs of StudyAppendix II –Additional ResourcesAbout the AuthorsVolume III: How to Empower Yourself and Influence OthersIntroductionSensory ProcessingAnchoringTrance and Trance Induction MethodsSensory Processing II – Sensory Sub-ModalitiesSensory Processing III – Sensory ImaginationSensory Processing IV – The Classical Elements and Subtle EnergyLanguage Patterns: Clear Thinking, Communication, and TranceSensory AcuityPacing and RapportPatterns for ChangeAppendix I – Suggested Programs of StudyAppendix II –Additional ResourcesAbout the AuthorsThe print version of The Book of Good Practices (available sometime in 2014) will be arranged with the chapters in a slightly different order and will be contained all in one volume.About the AuthorsTaylor Ellwood is the author of numerous books on the occult, as well as several books on business.
