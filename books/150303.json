  "description": "These selections from the sermons and writings of Archbishop Oscar Romero of San Salvador share the message of a holy prophet of modern times. Three short years transformed Archbishop Oscar Romero from a conservative defender of the status quo into one of the church's most outspoken voices of the oppressed. Though silenced by an assassin's bullet, his spirit--and the challenge of his life--lives on. He was beatified by Pope Francis in 2015.",
