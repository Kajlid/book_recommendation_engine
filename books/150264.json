  "description": "An exciting sexual adventure somewhere between 9 ½ Weeks and 50 Shades of Grey. Orphaned at birth, Alexandria Jones had always lived a Bohemian lifestyle, seeking the most out of each moment. She not only didn’t live the routine life most people lived, she had a hard time understanding why people were nearly robotic. She escaped the sequence of random homes child protection services placed her in by enlisting in the Marine Corps on her 17th birthday. Times were rough during her childhood, but the Corps fit her well and she felt pretty good until she met an older man who would ultimately reinforce a reality she knew well from her orphaned life – never trust anyone. Enrique intrigues Alex, but she finds herself pushing boundaries in her mind, her psyche that she never dreamed she would. He shows her alternative lifestyles and thought processes and how to find and fulfill dark desires. As their torrential relationship becomes the center of her thoughts pushing her to new levels of exotic, erotic experiences she never dreamed of. Together they take each other on a roller coaster ride of extreme sports, mixing risk with risqué sex.",
