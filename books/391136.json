  "description": "“The old woman laughed out loud, unbuttoned her calico shift and let it fall to her ankles. Annabelle kicked free of it, and pulled the pins from her hair. Naked in the moonlight, she whispered his name…“ They thought it was over. The werewolves Joan, Consuela, José and Mark, fought to save Tundra. Now they sit on Topaz’s High Council where they’re feeding the hungry, tackling race riots, rebuilding their world... But a daemon walks their streets by night. He knows about the little girl with the big secret. He knows all about her mirror and of the ancient evil that’s been awakened. A new war has just begun… Cover art and design by Quinton Veal",
