  "description": "THE TRAJECTORY OF DREAMS, chosen as #15 on Typographical Era's Best Reads of 2013.Lela White hasn't been the same since the space shuttle disintegrated into a bright blue sky when she was a ten year old girl--since her mother disappeared without a word or explanation. As an adult, Lela's life revolves around planning for the worst case scenario: the day she might have to kill to keep the space shuttle from exploding again. When a Russian cosmonaut on loan to the U.S. shuttle program finds himself drawn to Lela, he puts her carefully-constructed world at risk of an explosion as surely as he does his own upcoming launch. As Lela's universe unravels, no one is safe.“The Trajectory of Dreams is unsettling, beautifully written, and truly original. In Lela White, Nicole Wolverton has created one of the most haunting characters in contemporary fiction. This is a remarkable debut.” –Emily St. John Mandel, author of STATION ELEVEN",
