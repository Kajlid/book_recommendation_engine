  "description": "SHADOW HOUSE is a psychological supernatural thriller about two men, alive in different times, who share a terrible secret that, through a quirk of fate, saved one, but damned the other. These seemingly unconnected lives begin interleaving between five year old PJ McAvoy—critically injured when his family dies in a mysterious fire in 1920’s Massachusetts—and contemporary suburban family man, Aaron Molina, when he purchases an antique tool box at a flea market.Through Aarons “visions” into PJ’s tragic past, he witnesses the killer’s life firsthand, from the childhood injury that precipitates his paranormal ability to kill, through his orphaned youth and horrific WWII years. For every tragedy that befalls PJ, or act of mayhem he inflicts, he senses Aaron’s interfering presence and holds him responsible.To save himself and his family from PJ’s vendetta, Aaron must learn the secret that binds them together. PJ’s plans, however, go far beyond mere revenge, where his own death is not an obstacle, and Aaron’s demise will only be a footnote.This novel is aimed for avid thriller and horror readers who cuddle the \"chill of terror\" from authors such as Anne Rice and Stephen King, and even further, to mystery lovers who tantalize over the who, why, and how aspects of crime and death, from Dan Brown to Jonathan Kellerman.This is NOT a traditional ghost story.",
