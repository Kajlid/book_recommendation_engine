  "description": "Poppy the Pirate Dog is in charge of keeping the treasure safe, so what happens when some jewelry goes missing?It’s Mom’s birthday, so Tim and Suzy are planning a special pirate show for her. Poppy’s job is to guard the treasure, but while on duty, she hurts her eye and has to go to the vet. Worse yet, she comes home not with a pirate eye patch, but with a big plastic cone around her neck! While the rest of the family searches for Dad’s missing present—a sparkly necklace for Mom—Poppy sulks alone outside. But then Poppy catches sight of something twinkling in the grass. Is this her chance to redeem herself as the best pirate dog ever? This third early reader from Liz Kessler sparkles with warmth, humor, and a dash of pirate gold.",
