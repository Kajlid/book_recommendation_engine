  "description": "Robin Hood was a thief, and Rapunzel was a princess lost in the forest.I do a job, and I get paid. It isn’t complicated.Until her.I was to save the princess of Sherwood from a tower she was locked in and return her to her parents—the king and queen. I get a tidy sum as payment, and the crown pardons my merry men and me for our past crimes.But things did get complicated. Rapunzel wanted to go to the sea, and I ached to make that wish come true for her. As we made our journey, the passion and longing this princess brought out in me were impossible to ignore.I was caught between duty, honor, and desire. I had wanted her to trust me so she’d return to her parents. But I soon realized if I took her to the castle, I would never see her again. Never hold her in my arms again.At least, that’s what I thought would happen.I rescued Rapunzel, but in reality, she saved me.Rapunzel and Robin Hood is a fractured fairytale—not a retelling. It’s the first book in The Twisting Fairytales series. All characters are 18 and up, and this novel should be read only by a mature audience.",
