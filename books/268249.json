  "title": "Dragon Conversion Camp",
  "description": "Sam was always raised to believe dragons were evil, but when adolescence struck and he found out he was one, he quickly had to come to terms with his identity and hide the secret from his evangelical parents. Eventually he was discovered, however, and was forced into a dragon conversion camp where psychics and proselytizers swear that draconity can be prayed away. Can Sam and his new friends survive the camp's ordeals, or will one of the many disasters pressing down upon him sweep him into oblivion?",
