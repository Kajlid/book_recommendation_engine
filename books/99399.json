  "description": "We call it \"The Money Thing\": the elusive, often difficult mystery of acquiring, keeping, and continuing to produce enough money to be able to life the life of our choosing. While prescriptions and advice about one's money are as available and varied as diet plans for once's physical health, financial fitness appears to be as rare a thing as 3% body fat and proper cholesterol. But it doesn't have to be that way.The principles of financial fitness are available for everyone. Just as with diets for physical health and fitness, where fanaticism and extremism are not only suspect but are unsustainable, so too with financial fitness. What works best is knowledge and application of basic principles. Learning and applying these principles, over time, can produce incredible results, and, perhaps surprisingly, can also be a lot of fun.What is required is an understanding of the principles behind the Offense, Defense, and Playing Field of personal finance. With a basic understanding of these three areas, which are rarely taught together as a whole, anyone can learn to prosper, conserve, and multiply the fruits of his or her labor.",
