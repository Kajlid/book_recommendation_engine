From tea parties to teaching Leia how to fly a TIE fighter, regulating the time she spends talking with friends via R2-D2's hologram, and making sure Leia doesn't leave the house wearing only a skirted metal bikini, Vader's parenting skills are put hilariously to the test.Edition MSRP: $14⁹⁵ U.S. / £9⁹⁹ U.K. (ISBN 978-1-4521-1869-7)",
