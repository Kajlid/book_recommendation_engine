Employing Western philosophical categories to describe significant issues in the history of philosophy, Wen Haiming considers Chinese political philosophy in the pre-Qin era, Chinese metaphysics from Han to Tang dynasties, Chinese epistemology from Song to Ming dynasties and modern Chinese-Western comparative philosophy. Chinese Philosophy provides a clear, accessible conception of the Chinese philosophical sensibility and its evolution throughout history.",
