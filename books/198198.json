  "title": "Jesus, Why and How?: Heaven-Sin-Forgiveness-Punishment",
  "description": "This book explains the hardest questions in the Bible by approaching them from a totally different direction. For example, no one can adequately define the word \"sin\". We think we know what it means, but we use it to refer to specific behaviors (stealing, murder, adultery, lying etc. - basically anything the Old Testament commandments forbid). The Bible says Jesus came to take away our sin - not simply change our behavior. Sin is not behavior, but something far deeper, more personal, and fixable - an invisible condition. In Genesis after the man sinned, God said, \"The man has become like one of us.\" This is a real problem because God and the man were separate beings, and God tolerates no rivals. How do you fix the fact that the man has \"Become like one of us?\"     Additionally, Jesus, Why and How offers an explanation for Christ as life by defining the word \"life\" and laying down life's requirements. We'll use the temporal, biological life we see around us to make the case for the eternal, spiritual life that is also all around us and within some of us.     Later in the book we'll discuss the two commands God has given us. One was a command to not do something. The other is a command to do something. God has and will punish mankind for doing and not doing these two commands. I'll tell you what they are in this book.",
