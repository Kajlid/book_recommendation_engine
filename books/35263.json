  "description": "Sometimes you can be your own best cheerleader! Eight-year-old Annie McRae is irresistible―with her toothless grin, turquoise-blue cowboy boots, and her upbeat twist on life, she spends most days surrounded by cheers of “Hip, hip, hooray for Annie McRae!” from Mom, Dad, Mr. Garcia, and Grandma C. But what happens when the grownups are too busy to cheer? Don’t you worry―Annie pulls herself up by the bootstraps and realizes that the best “hip, hip, hoorays” come from herself and caring for others. •As an added bonus, readers can try to spy the “hidden” horseshoes in each illustration! 800L Brad Wilcox is a prolific author who has devoted his life to teaching both children and adults.
