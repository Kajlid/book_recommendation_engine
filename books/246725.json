  "title": "A Dream Called Home",
  "description": "An inspiring new memoir from Reyna Grande, the National Book Critics Circle Award finalist and national bestselling author of The Distance Between Us, about her quest for belonging, a writing career, and a home built of more than words and dreams.A Dream Called Home is the follow up to Reyna Grande’s national bestselling memoir The Distance Between Us. In that book, Reyna recounted the pain and poverty she experienced growing up in Mexico without her parents, who had immigrated to the U.S. years earlier. When she was nine years old, Reyna made her own journey across the U.S.–Mexico border in search of a home. What she found instead was an indifferent mother, an abusive, alcoholic father, and a school system that didn’t honor her heritage. Against all obstacles, Reyna’s love of reading and writing propelled her to rise above all challenges and ultimately be accepted to the University of California, Santa Cruz.A Dream Called Home tells the story of Reyna’s pursuit to become the first in her family to earn a college degree and to find her place and a home in her adoptive country. At UC, Santa Cruz and on her own for the first time, Reyna faces new struggles and learns to forge ahead toward her dreams despite the alienation and estrangement from her family and her new community. Back in Los Angeles after graduation, Reyna attempts to parlay her creative writing degree into a full-time job only to discover she knows nothing about the publishing business. Through it all, Reyna holds fast to her dreams and makes the impossible possible—she goes from being an undocumented immigrant to an award-winning author. Reyna details the arduous journey of pursuing her dream of becoming a writer and finding that one thing she has desperately longed for ever since her parents left her behind in Mexico—a home.This is an inspiring account of one young woman’s quest to find her place in America as a first-generation university student, a Latina, and a writer determined to change the course of her family forever. Reyna’s story mirrors the journey that millions of immigrants have taken as she creates her own path toward a better life for herself on her own terms.",
