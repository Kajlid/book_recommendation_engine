  "description": "Eli Arnold headed to Florida for a quiet summer vacation. Sixth grade behind, he and his older brother, Brady, were ready for some fun. Little does Eli know, however, that he was chosen millennia ago to save the world. Manipulated by unknown forces, Eli is plunged into a centuries old battle between the Keepers and the Order of Disorder. Botched alien abductions, lost civilizations, and “blood-thirsty” mummies (that’s Eli’s story and he’s sticking with it) are just a few of the many dangerous situations in which Eli finds himself. The action is non-stop as he travels time and the globe in an attempt to recover the powerful Keys to Forever, find his brother, and get home.",
