  "description": "Valentina Rossi.She was our first and only love—our f*cking everything.She was also the one who tore us apart and crushed our hearts into a pulp. After all these years, we three are still desperately trying to fix the mess she made of us. Even if that meant pretending she was just a childish memory, pushed to the confinements of our mind, just so we could survive without her.But now she’s back.Demanding we give her what she stole from us to begin with; our very souls.But behind her tempting proposal, there is an underlying despair.We all feel it. We can even taste the bitter melancholy with each kiss we steal from her.Valentina ripped our hearts out when we were still too dumb and stupid to know any better.Now I fear if we give in to her again, there will be no coming back from the heartbreak that awaits all of us.She will end up killing what’s left of us, with every last breath she takes.And I’m not sure any of us can stop it.",
