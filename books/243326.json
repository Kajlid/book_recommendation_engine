  "title": "Ask a Manager: How to Navigate Clueless Colleagues, Lunch-Stealing Bosses, and the Rest of Your Life at Work",
  "description": "What do you say when your new job is very different from what you agreed to? How do you tell your boss that your workload is too heavy, or that you need more training? How do you deal with a colleague whose loud speaker phone calls are driving you insane? And how do you repair your reputation after getting drunk at the company holiday party? Ten years of writing a workplace advice column have taught Green that people tend to avoid difficult conversations in the office because we simply don't know what to say. But the stakes are just as high if we don't speak up, because problems that could be solved with a simple conversation can fester if they aren't addressed. In this witty and practical guide, Green tackles 200 of those delicate discussions that you need to have, but might not be sure how to begin - and arms you with the wording to do it. Along the way, she shares some of the most outlandish and hilarious letters she's received from readers over the years - from an employee who placed a black magic 'curse' on her coworkers to a boss who repeatedly stole an employee's lunch.You'll learn what to say when:*Your coworker keeps pushing her work on you*Your new job is very different than what you agreed to*Your boss seems unhappy with your work*You catch an employee in a lie*Colleagues keep making judgmental comments about your diet*Your coworker's loud speaker phone calls are making you homicidal . . . and plenty more difficult or awkward situations you might find yourself in!",
