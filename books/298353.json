  "description": "Fulfill your sex kitten fantasies and your crafting jones at the same time: knit naughty! Naughty Needles is a fun and feisty knitting adventure filled with designs that can go from bedroom to costume party and back again. Play it sweet in a Fembot babydoll nightie or sex it up in Hootchie Kootchie pasties. When you're feeling frisky, knit up the Baby Blue-Ball Gag or play dress-up in the naughty nurse cap or the felted Red Riding Hood cape. New and experienced knitters alike will find inventive and easy-to-follow patterns. And since the garments aren't exactly full-coverage, they don't take much time to complete. With inspiration from retro icons like surfer Gidget, Mrs. Robinson, and cavegirl Raquel Welch, Nikol Lohr pushes the boundaries of the traditional \"wifely\" crafts into the age of Sex and the City and cuddle parties. Part how-to guide, part peep show, Naughty Needles is a brash, tongue-in-cheek take on an age-old art. From the demure to the bizarre, with a splash of fetish thrown in, these are the projects that will make you smile--and make your partner growwwwl.",
