  "title": "Bill Smith Goes to College",
  "description": "Those who have attended college know that it is a life-changing event. The university experience is an adventure, one that embodies the summit of our highest hopes and the pit of our deepest fears. This strange tale is a fantasy about one young man’s college experience. His convoluted quest weaves a path through unforeseen challenges and surprising test scores. Oh, and the characters! Who could be more enticing in a novel than droning teachers and paper-shuffling administrative bureaucrats? Yes. Now you get the picture. Enduring endless lectures in crowded classrooms can be just as exciting as alien space battles on distant planets. Honest. I wouldn’t kid you. This is more than just a cute little novel. It is a search for the real graduate in all of us. It will change your life as no book has done before. Scared yet? Just keep telling yourself: it’s only a story – it’s not real life. Or is it?This book is about 55,000 words long (a short novel). It may be suitable for the oldest teenagers, though most will not know what the story is really talking about. It is intended for adults who want their paradigms challenged. For more information: http://www.amazon.com/Bill-Smith-Goes...",
