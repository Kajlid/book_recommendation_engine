  "description": "Sophie Leighton is a Faery living with her parents in Sydney, and Boke Maiga is a powerful Witch from a lineage of one of the most powerful and revered sorcerers of all time. Boke stumbles upon a secret so big, it threatens her own survival. But she made a promise to Chu Mana, and can’t turn back now, not after betraying her. When Sophie said she’d gladly help Boke in breaking Chu Mana out of the supernatural prison, she had no idea that Boke would call in the favour so soon. Breaking random school rules is tolerable, but breaking into the most secure prison in the world is, without doubt, suicidal. But Boke insists Chu Mana must be freed from Apros, even though the action will anger the High Coven, an ancient coven of the most powerful Witches in the world. With the stakes being so much higher than other ventures they’ve undertaken before, the consequences this time are equally as high, and the task itself proves near impossible. The third semester at Drachenburg might just be their last semester at school, and maybe even their last semester as free members of the Supernatural Society.",
