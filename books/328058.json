A forgotten woman of history - Napoleon's last love, the audacious Albine de Montholon - narrates their tale of intrigue, passion, and betrayal. After the defeated Emperor Napoleon goes into exile on tiny St. Helena Island in the remote South Atlantic, he and his lover, Albine de Montholon, plot to escape and rescue his young son. Banding together African slaves, British sympathizers, a Jewish merchant, a Corsican rogue, and French followers, they confront British opposition - as well as treachery within their own ranks - with sometimes subtle, sometimes bold, but always desperate action.Interspersed within the exile story, Napoleon finishes his real novel \"Clisson\" that he started writing as a young man. Now it's a father's message to the young son whom his enemies took from him, but how can they get it to the boy?When Napoleon and Albine break faith with one another, ambition and Albine's husband threaten their reconciliation. To survive, Albine must decide whom to betray. To succeed, Napoleon must learn whom to trust.Two hundred years after Napoleon's death, this elegant, richly researched novel reveals the man history conceals.",
