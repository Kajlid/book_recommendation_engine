  "description": "A darkly comic short story, a fable about the all too real impact that we humans have on the environmentFox 8 has always been known as the daydreamer in his pack, the one his fellow foxes regarded with a knowing snort and a roll of the eyes. That is, until Fox 8 develops a unique skill: He teaches himself to speak \"Yuman\" by hiding in the bushes outside a house and listening to children's bedtime stories. The power of language fuels his abundant curiosity about peopleâ€”even after \"danjer\" arrives in the form of a new shopping mall that cuts off his food supply, sending Fox 8 on a harrowing quest to help save his pack.",
