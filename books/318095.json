Finding her on the side of the highway broke down; she rocked my world. She’s self-assured and not taking shit from anyone. Who is she and where did she come from?  Makayla I can’t believe my eyes when he pulls over to help me—riding a Harley with a leather cut on. I thought I left that behind me when I left the only home I had known I was raised by my dad who was a member of an MC until he died in a freak motorcycle accident. I swore I wouldn’t fall for a man in leather, but there is just something about him that calls to me.",
