  "description": "Belle has it all—beauty, brains, and an extravagant inheritance from her father, the most powerful banker in the city.  There’s only one problem. Her glittering life is a waking nightmare just beneath the surface.  When Belle’s brain is damaged in a horrible attack on the morning of her final exam, everything unravels. Before long, she’s lost it all—her memories, her inheritance, and her freedom. Then she finds herself at the mercy of the Beast, who’s even harsher than she ever imagined him to be.  How much will Belle have to sacrifice to end her nightmare? And what happens when everything she has isn’t enough? Twisted: Belle’s Story is a retelling of Beauty and the Beast and Book 3 in the Destined series, a collection of overlapping fairy tales set in the same magical world. Each story is self-contained, with its own protagonist and satisfying happily-ever-after, but they also tell an over-arching story. Read them in order: Torn: Novelette Prequel to Cinderella Book 1 – Fated: Cinderella’s Story Book 2 – Hidden: Rapunzel’s Story Book 3 – Twisted: Belle’s Story - coming in March 2018 Book 4 – Betrayed: Ruby’s Story - release date TBA",
