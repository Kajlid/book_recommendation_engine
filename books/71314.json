  "description": "New writing from Betsy Warland, Alex Leslie, Nancy Jo Cullen, Theodosia Henney, Peter Knegt, Kevin Shaw, Emilia Nielsen, Susan Holbrook, Stacy Brewster, Lindsay Cahill, Kevin McLellan, Geer Austin, Matthew Loney, Trevor Corkum, Kyle Kushnir, Leah Horlick.Plenitude Magazine aims to promote the growth and development of LGBTTQI literature and film through a biannual electronic publication of literary fiction, nonfiction, poetry and graphic narrative by both emerging and established LGBTTQI writers and artists, and to foster a community through an online forum for the exchange of ideas, opportunities, contacts, and resources.We define queer literature and film as that which is created by LGBTTQI people, rather than that which features queer content alone. That said, we recognise that Plenitude readers are hungry for exceptional works that reflect queer histories, cultures, experiences, and sensibilities. Our editorial process involves critical literary analyses, as well as socio-historical considerations, sometimes turning to an advisory editorial board of writers, academics, and community advocates.Plenitude aims to complicate expressions of queerness through the publication of diverse, sophisticated literary writing, art and film, from the very subtle to the brash and unrelenting.",
