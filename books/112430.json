  "description": "Spencer Moretti knows what she wants career-wise—a spot on one of the big radio networks with her own interview show, and she’s determined to get it. She has a knack for getting musicians to relax and blurt out things that make their agents clutch their heads whenever she interviews bands on the top rated radio station in New Orleans. When she’s thrown—literally—into close proximity to Geoff Lane, she hears him utter a closely guarded secret that can shoot her right up to a network contract. If she can get him to let her interview him about it, that is.The former lead guitarist for Axis certainly didn’t intend to reveal anything about his top secret project, but the fact that he’s leaking his plans to a successful radio announcer flies right out of his head. Maybe it’s because she’s so young and cute and feisty sitting there across from him. That Cheshire Cat smile on her lips kinda makes him want to tell her anything she wants to hear. Against the advice of his manager, Geoff agrees to let Spencer interview him.Once they’re alone, though, things go sideways, and Spencer leaves without her interview and with her illusions shattered about a man she’d always admired. Even though they ended on a bad note, Geoff can’t get Spencer out of his mind, and returns to New Orleans to try to make things right. But someone doesn’t want him anywhere near her, and they’re going to great lengths to scare Geoff off. When it becomes clear Spencer’s being stalked by a madman, can Geoff protect her, or will the killer silence her forever?",
