  "title": "How the Whale Became and Other Stories",
  "description": "Long ago when the world was brand new, the sun rose into the sky and brought tje first day. Then, from every side, from under leaves and from behind rocks, creatures began to appear.To begin with, all the creatures were rather alike - they had no idea what they were going to become. Some wanted to become lions, so they practised being lions. But other creatures - including the whale, the elephant, the cat and the donkey - came about in different ways.There are eleven animal stories in this collection for younger children to enjoy. They are particularly suitable for reading aloud and Ted Hughes himself read them to his own children when they were young.Ted Hughes' classic text is accompanied by the beautiful illustrations of Jackie Morris to bring a lyrical and witty version of the creation myths.",
