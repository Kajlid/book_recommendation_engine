  "description": "Who knew the eyes of a young girl from the East coast of Africa would see the far corners of the world? Indian-African Nargis Gercke was born in the Kenyan town of Mombasa before her family moved to Dar-es-Salaam (\"the haven of peace) in neighbouring Tanganyika where she enjoyed a childhood so idyllic it felt like a hazy summer day. In Life Actually, Nargis tells her story of growing up in a vibrant multicultural family, being shipped off to boarding school in England and finally spreading her wings across the globe. As one of the first women in Dar-es-Salaam to marry a Caucasian, she and her Swiss husband, Siggi, leave the nest in 1970 and immerse themselves in a swath of cultures from Israel and Spain to China and Canada. The world is a pearl that Nargis has discovered time and time again. This isn't a life half-lived, this is life... actually.http://www.amazon.ca/Life-Actually-Me...",
