  "description": "In the span of forty-eight hours, socially awkward valedictorian, Kylie Flores and conceited jock, Max Langston, who've never spoken in four years of high school, will find themselves kidnapped, taken over the Mexican border, married and falling in love. Kylie's best friend, Will, Max's girlfriend, Lily and Max's wingman, Charlie are the unlikely cavalry charged with rescuing them. Against all odds, this crew must find their way back over the border in time for graduation and for Kylie to give her long awaited valedictorian speech, without killing each other en route.Hilarious and poignant, FROM WHAT I REMEMBER blends high-octane adventure, romance and coming of age. No one is exactly who they seem here and by the end of their road trip together, they will all be changed in ways they never could have imagined.FROM WHAT I REMEMBER was recently nominated for a YALSA Reader's Choice Award. Film rights bought by Paramount Pictures.",
