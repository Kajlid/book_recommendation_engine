  "description": "Sometimes chocolate is better than a golden ring. Etta Bannon must endure another Christmas at the Indian Residential School for girls. With her heart heavy for home that is a two-day train ride away, all she has is the stolen moments with her beau to look forward to, but even the boy she cares deeply about cannot erase her longing for her family. Charlie Shawanda is also stuck at the Indian Residential School for boys. Only a mere jog away from Etta, he longs to make their last Christmas at the school special before they graduate in the spring and go their separate ways. But what he truly years for is to call Etta his very own. When a golden opportunity arises for Charlie to show his love, he must make a tough decisionâ€“endure the cruel punishment of the strap or miss out on a chance to tell Etta how he truly feels and maybe lose her forever.",
