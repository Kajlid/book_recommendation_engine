  "description": "Do you believe in Evil? Most Dubliners have heard the stories about the Lodge at the Hellfire Club on top of Montpelier Hill, in Rathfarnham, County Dublin, and the evil goings on of the place, but are they aware of what really happened? It is a stormy autumn night in the year 1739, and the Earl of Rosse and some of his associates - all Freemasons and members of the irreverent and infamous Hellfire Club - have invited two guests to play cards with them. Drink and gambling follow, until one of the guests sees something he wishes he never did. What will happen to him and his companion? Will they survive the night and make it to the morning and home, or will they go the same way as countless people before them, disappearing without a trace forever? 'The Legend of Montpelier Hill' is a gothic-horror short novella of 15,000 words.",
