  "description": "For high-schooler Nathan Bristol, finding out his sister's best friend, Trina Bivens, has come back as a zombie is the least of his problems. While she may not have a hankering for his flesh, her visions predict the world will soon be overrun by zombies who do. Further, she reveals Nathan will play a huge part in saving the world. The boy can't even make it through third period Chemistry without making a mess of things, much less stop a zombie apocalypse. What follows is a harrowing race to rescue his mother, deliver his family from teeth-chomping danger and maybe, just maybe, save the world. BOOK ONE: OVERRUN deals with Trina and Nathan's tenuous relationship with each other and the rest of the world. Branded as turncoats by zombies and humans alike, the two must forge a bond in order to rescue Nathan's family and put them on the road together to save the world from the evil entity that has released the undead.",
