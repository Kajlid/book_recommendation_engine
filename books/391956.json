  "title": "Middle Aged American Tao : The Novel",
  "description": "Scavinold takes our understanding of modern Taoism to a new depth. We scratch the surface of these paradigms in our search for meaning, but how do we correlate it to our everyday existence? How do we ascertain whether our reactions to life's constant dramas are in synch with the fundamental ideas of an ancient oriental philosophy? Most of the literature available to us on Taoism are compilations of quotes and metaphors - fluffy stuff that fills the moment. In Middle Aged American Tao, Scavinold leads us down a very dark winding path of modern realities that decimate and cripple our peace of mind, relationships, and youth. His protagonist, Alex, is the embodiment of Tao in the modern American society. He acts without preaching, teaches by doing, and withstands - from within a constant state of Tao - the onslaught of today's many social incertitudes. Using Tai Chi as his vehicle and spyglass, we are allowed to glimpse, through Alex, the world of a modern American Taoist.",
