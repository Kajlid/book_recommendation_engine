  "description": "Sometimes running away takes you straight to the thing you're running from.New York Times and USA Today bestselling authors, Victoria Danann and Teresa Gabelman, team up to create a sigh-worthy wolf shifter romance that will leave you satisfied in the dreamiest way. The Three Rivers Pack has been deeply embedded in Kerrville commerce and society for generations. They own businesses and hold government offices, including that of sheriff. But the influx of retirees and well-to-do building second homes in the Hill Country has squeezed the shifters for room to run.The only answer is relocation to a less populated locale and that will require making a deal with the pack that holds that territory. The alliance struck by the two alphas is blood seal, a political mating between the Lobos alpha's daughter and the Three Rivers alpha's son. It's the perfect solution that benefits both tribes.Except nobody asked Fleet Ryder and Dani Alvarez if they were willing. And they aren't.Set against the stark, but breathtakingly remote and beautiful Big Bend region of Texas.",
