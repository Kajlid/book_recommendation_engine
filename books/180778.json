Convinced to make her mark, Lauren begs for the chance to prove herself. Her mission? To investigate the growing popularity of sex clubs in Los Angeles, and figure out how the sensual underworld functions.Out of her element, Lauren starts her search with pen and paper in hand at a local sex shop, hoping she’ll find a trail that leads to the lairs of sex and fetishes. Instead, it leads her to Nathan Sanders. He’s daunting, charming, and a little too dark and mysterious for her taste, but Lauren knows he’s what she needs as her way in.What she doesn’t see coming is that Nathan is all too willing to invite her to a nightclub she’s only ever heard stories about, and also the fact that Nathan know’s Lauren doesn’t have a clue what she’s getting herself into. This could be fun, they said. There’s no harm in it, they agreed.Little do they know, a little research can serve up some unexpected results.",
