  "description": "Since the dawn of time, the Light of Epertase has determined when the throne was to be passed from elder to heir. For more than a thousand years, the Light's decision had never been challenged-until now. When a ruthless army advances on Epertase, the Light determines that corrupt King Elijah is no longer fit to rule - his daughter, Princess Alina, is the kingdom's only hope for salvation. When evil men violently abduct her, Epertase's fall appears inevitable. But all is not lost, for Alina has a secret lover lurking in the outer mountains; a long-banished warrior willing to bring down armies and King Elijah himself to save her. His name is Rasi and he prepares for blood. Deadly men plan to sacrifice Alina for the Light of Epertase that lives within her soul. Rasi plans to kill all who try. The kingdom's fate hangs in the balance.",
