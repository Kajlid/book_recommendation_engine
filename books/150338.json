  "description": "Welcome to Buck Falls, Michigan, where the gossip is fresh, the people are feisty, and the circus has pulled in for a limited engagement.  The last thing police chief Graham Tyler needs is a ragtag bunch of circus freaks rolling into town.  Then he meets sassy, spirited, ringmaster Belle-Anne Black.  Belle-Anne's got a rule against dating townies, and she's not about to break it... even for the spicy hot lawman who makes her insides sizzle. Then Graham makes her an offer she can't refuse: one night only, no repeat performances.  Of course, in the circus nothing ever goes exactly to plan.",
