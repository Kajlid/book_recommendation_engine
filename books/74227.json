Ceridwen, a young woman with divided loyalties, watches as the peace and plenty she enjoys at the Saxon stronghold of Kilton gives way to wary watchfulness. Her dearest friend, Ælfwyn, sold in marriage to a Dane in a desperate bid for peace, travels to Kilton and recounts the events that befell the fortress of Four Stones in captured Lindisse. But Ceridwen is also confronted by Sidroc, the Dane she ran from, and cannot forget.

At the heart of Kilton is Gyric’s brother Godwin, the young lord who struggles both against the Danish invaders and an unthinkable desire. Growing tensions between the brothers mirror the escalating threat to the Saxons from the Danes. The Fate of all at Kilton hangs in the balance at a single terrifying battle, as the Danes attempt to extinguish it and conquer the whole people who would be soon known as The English...Meticulously researched and thrillingly brought to life, here is Ceridwen of Kilton, book two of the historical adventure saga The Circle of Ceridwen Trilogy",
