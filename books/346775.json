  "description": "Mallory and Meredith Brynn are no ordinary twins: born on either side of midnight, one has the power to see into the future, the other into the past.But supernatural visions can’t keep Merry from falling for the new boy in town, even if the relationship is doomed from the start. The reason? Ben is a ghost. And revealing the truth about her own power would mean the end of their blossoming love.As Merry falls for Ben, the twins sense a dark shadow encroaching on their family’s inner circle: someone wants their beloved little brother, and that someone will stop at nothing to take him away. Using their supernatural visions, the twins must come together to save their brother from harm. And along the way, they’re forced to question the loyalty of everyone in their lives, even those closest to them...JACQUELYN MITCHARD uses her skill as a novelist to bring us a story that is truly based in family and mystery — and at the same time threatens all that we hold most dear.",
