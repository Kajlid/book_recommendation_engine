  "description": "Edinburgh, 1822. Young Robbie is just eight years old when he witnesses his mother’s agonizing pain and then death from the removal of a breast tumor during public surgery at the hands of one savage surgeon, Dr. Knox. The sounds of his mother’s piercing cries haunt Robbie as he and his hapless father and baby sister try to go on. But life proves bitter when Robbie’s father loses his business and disappears. Years of poverty go by as Robbie cares for his sister in the Edinburgh slums. Fueled by anger and grief, the teenaged Robbie seems to be heading for a life on the wrong side of the law when he helps the men providing “the butcher Knox” with dead bodies for his medical research. For years, Robbie thinks of Knox as his mother’s killer and wants revenge. He’s convinced that Knox is involved in a murderous trade in bodies for experimentation and plans a confrontation. It will take time to see the motives behind Knox’s corrupt methods. Perhaps there will be a way to give some meaning to his mother’s tragic death after all.",
