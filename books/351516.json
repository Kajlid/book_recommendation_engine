  "description": "Book four in the Poker Night Series Angelo Pilato's worked hard to overcome his upbringing. Born in the rough part of the city, he had two choices, learn to fight or learn to talk your way out of confrontation. He isn't prepared to deal with a man like the sexy detective in charge of his friend's case. Moody Torrance is vastly different than any man Angelo's ever been attracted to. Stubborn and bossy don't begin to describe Moody's personality and those are his positive qualities. Moody hasn't the time or energy to put up with sissies. He may be gay, but that doesn't mean he's any less the Alpha he was born to be. Within minutes of meeting Angelo Pilato, Moody both hates and wants him. There's nothing more he'd like to do than bring the prissy man down a few pegs and show him life on the wild side. How do a quirky neurotic and an unbendable Alpha make a relationship work?",
