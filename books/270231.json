  "description": "Ruth didn’t want to be a whore. But when the DCR Police showed up at her house on April 21, 2035, a few weeks after her 18th birthday, she knew that she had been drafted into the Sexual Service Corp. She was hauled off to classification and training and turned into a delightful, first class erotic instrument. Now, thirteen years later, she must cope with the dramatic transformation back into a ‘normal’ life. And she must find a responsible male to take custody over her or report to the Unsupervised Female Pool for auction. But who would want to have a former whore as a partner? Only the most depraved of men. Was she going from the frying pan into the fire?",
