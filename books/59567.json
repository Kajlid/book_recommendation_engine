  "description": "In Gods & Monsters, it's been one year since they stopped an alien invasion, and now things get hard! New members, new costumes and 12 months of gossip to catch up on! Who's getting married? Who's divorced? Who's gone nuts since we last saw them? See Ultimate Hulk and the secret origin of Ultimate Thor, and get a look at the entire Ultimate Universe as drawn by Bryan Hitch! It's guest-stars galore - featuring the X-Men, Daredevil, Captain Britain and even the Defenders! And in Grand-Theft America, Tony and Natasha are on the eve of their wedding - but when Nick Fury makes his move against the mysterious traitor that's been plaguing the team, the Ultimates will never be the same! Also, Captain America and Wasp hit a serious snag in their relationship. Is this the end for the Ultimate Universe's hottest couple? Is this the beginning of the end for the Ultimates? This deluxe hardcover collects Ultimates 2 Vol. 1: Gods & Monsters and Ultimates 2 Vol. 2: Grand-Theft America, plus Ultimates Annual #1.",
