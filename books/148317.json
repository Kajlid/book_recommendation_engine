But these are not your grandma's Sunday school angels! They are young, Gothic and seductive.  When the Dark Ones, a group of ominous students show up at her boarding school in the English countryside, Trinity Heart is convinced they are behind a series of strange and tragic events that began soon after they arrived.  When a quartet of stunningly beautiful students arrive at school, immediately confronting the Dark Ones, tension escalates. Confrontation seems inevitable.  Will the angelic new students be able to stop the Dark Ones from changing the life path of one particularly promising student? And what are these feelings Trinity has for the ethereal Logan?  The Trinity Heart Series appeals to teens looking for something mysterious, provocative, and deliciously dark.",
