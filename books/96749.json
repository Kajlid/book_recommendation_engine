  "title": "Strange Worlds - Surreal Stories and Tainted Tales",
  "description": "Slip into fifteen dark tales that show the world through a strange new perspective. Take your imagination on a journey that begins before birth and continues long after death, stopping off to marvel, tremble and wonder at the strange worlds in between. Meet zombies, vampires, leprechauns, even a genie, as you have never seen them before. Ponder what the world feels like for a child as yet unborn, spend a sleepless night with a would-be murderer, and see what becomes of the angel who trades places with one of the most vulnerable in our society. Find out what life feels like when you can no longer rely on your senses, when you have no-one left to trust, not even yourself… If you like your short fiction shrouded in darkness and sprinkled with the strange, then this is the collection for you. Leap into the unknown, and see the world through someone else’s mind…",
