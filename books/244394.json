And with the enclosed CD, children of all ages can enjoy dinosaur-themed Christmas party music, and hear the story read aloud by the Today Show 's Al Roker! A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the book goes to support the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where the story is set.",
