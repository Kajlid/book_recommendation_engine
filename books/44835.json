  "description": "A call-to-arms from Nobel Prize?winning economist and best-selling author Paul Krugman. The Great Recession is more than four years old, and counting. Yet, as Paul Krugman points out in this powerful volley, \"Nations rich in resources, talent, and knowledge, all the ingredients for prosperity and a decent standard of living for all, remain in a state of intense pain.\" How bad have things gotten? How did we get stuck in what now can only be called a depression? And above all, how do we free ourselves? Krugman pursues these questions with his characteristic lucidity and insight. He has a powerful message for anyone who has suffered over these past four years: a quick, strong recovery is just one step away, if our leaders can find the \"intellectual clarity and political will\" to end this depression now.",
