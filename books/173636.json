  "description": "St. Patrick's Day used to be all about the Party for Kellan and Jamie Monday. A bottle of Powers; a case of Guinness; random relatives and friends dropping in in taxis to do shots and listen to Kelly's beloved Paddy Rock all night long. The clean-up would take days, but it was all worth it for their favorite holiday of the year.Then along came the babies. Rory and Shea are the apple of their dads' eyes, the center of their world... but not really party-friendly. Jamie and Kelly haven't had a night out in six months, though, so Jamie's mother offers to take the teething twins for St. Pat's. Except she turns up sick on the day of, and it looks like the idea of a super-dad date isn't in the cards after all. Not unless one of them finds a way, anyhow...This story is a free, fluffy short that takes place three years after Nobody's Hero. Cover art by Astro.",
