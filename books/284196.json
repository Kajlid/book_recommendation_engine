Now he's come back home armed with nothing but a set of nunchuks, a hell-bent-for-leather attitude and one dark secret, to find nothing much has changed on \"the Rez\" — short of a glimmering new casino, and a once-proud people overcome by drugs and organized crime.In this third volume of the acclaimed SCALPED series, on the day after the grand opening of a new casino, undercover FBI agent Dashiell Bad Horse's home reservation wakes up to find that two women have been murdered during the night. It's up to Dash to find the killers and, in the process, come to grips with his relationship with his own mother.Collects: Scalped #12–18",
