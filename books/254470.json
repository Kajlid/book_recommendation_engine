  "description": "Rancor Maleficent and his Mexican counterpart, Roberto Rodriguez, are bounty hunters based in Mayweather, California. It is the last of the nineteenth century, and things in the old west were just winding down. As the curse of men who trade cash for flesh continues, Rancorâ€™s reputation stretches a decade and grows even more. Roberto mysteriously partners up with the unapproachable bounty hunter and his wolf-dog. The seeming jovial but psychopathic Mexican was the last man expected to join Maleficent's side.",
