  "description": "Ashleigh Griffen swore she'd never give her heart to another horse -- not after a terrible disease wiped out her family's breeding farm, along with Ashleigh's favorite mare, Stardust. Now the Griffens are starting over as breeding managers at Townsend Acres, and Ashleigh's sure she is going to hate living there. Then a small, sickly foal is born -- a beautiful copper filly that looks like Stardust. No one thinks the foal will live or that it's worth trying to save. No one but Ashleigh. Can one girl's love alone work miracles? Read Thoroughbred and experience the love and friendship between a determined girl and a very special filly.",
