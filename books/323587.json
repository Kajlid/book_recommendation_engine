  "title": "The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism",
  "description": "A New York Times bestseller people can believe in--by a pioneer of the new urban Christians (Christianity Today) and the C.S. Lewis for the 21st century (Newsweek).Timothy Keller, the founding pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, addresses the frequent doubts that skeptics, and even ardent believers, have about religion. Using literature, philosophy, real-life conversations, and potent reasoning, Keller explains how the belief in a Christian God is, in fact, a sound and rational one. To true believers he offers a solid platform on which to stand their ground against the backlash to religion created by the Age of Skepticism. And to skeptics, atheists, and agnostics, he provides a challenging argument for pursuing the reason for God.",
