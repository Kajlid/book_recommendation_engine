  "description": "This beautifully intricate fantasy, with its feisty heroine, breath-taking action and heart-wrenching romance, will delight fans of The Lunar Chronicles and A Court of Thorns and Roses.  Reality sucks. Make-believe rocks. That's been Fate Floyd's motto for as long as she's been a fantasy geek. But now she can hardly tell what's real and what's not. She's been spelled and mysteriously trapped within a deadly fairy tale world bound by the Book of Fables. Her only way home is to travel through the book's 8 unfortunate fairy tales and change them into happily-ever-afters. And if dealing with scheming sorceresses, greedy goblins and heartless faeries isn't enough to test her sanity, there's Finn. The Scottish boy who looks like he stepped straight out of her dreams. As it turns out, make-believe isn't as fun as Fate thought it would be. The reality is, her road to freedom isn't straight, and danger lurks around every bend.  The Lonely Sorceress: The first unfortunate fairy tale in the Book of Fables. Fate and Finn find themselves on a magical island, where they hatch a plan to play cupid to give the sorceress a happy ending. But all the while, Fate wonders why Finn is so familiar. The closer she comes to the truth, the more she denies it.  PLEASE NOTE: This title is Part 1 of 8 and is meant to be read in sequence.  Genre: Young Adult Fantasy",
