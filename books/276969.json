  "description": "First two books together...Four PsychosI'm not so different from most people.Like everyone else, I have life goals.Goal #1: Become a real girl instead of this invisible ghost thing I currently am.Goal #2: Convince the four men I've been haunting for the past five years to pick me to be their new toy after goal one is complete.Goal #3: Figure out who/what I am and why I can't remember anything past the five years I've been haunting this quad.Goal #4: Eat popcorn.See? Perfectly normal. Sort of.Gotta start small, after all.It's not like anyone else is perfect either.****Three TrialsSo, I've checked off some life goals and added a few new ones to my list.Goal #5: Get out of hell's belly without letting my ungrateful charges die.Goal #6: Get a new name that's more badass.Goal #7: Stop wasting my breath on lectures and start annoying the quad hell squad every time they annoy me. Fight fire with fire. Ha! Another hell pun.Goal 8: Find out who the hell killed me.I'll add more. I don't want to overwhelm myself before I even finish checking off my old goals. But seriously, I really do need a more badass name, considering how much I have to keep saving my damsels in distress.I probably shouldn't call them damsels, since they're a little murderous and all.Maybe I should add seeing a hell-certified psychologist to my list of goals.**Sexual situations/content**Reverse Harem**Dark humor galore**Language warning",
