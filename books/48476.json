  "description": "An endless war, a regime where gays and Lesbians disappear into the night, a land where people can't trust their neighbors, a \"free election\" fixed by computers, a rumor of underground resistance, a radical preacher, and a stolen cache of weapons. These are the flammable materials in the world of Peb Corbo, sports star at her school, reluctant rebel and closet Lesbian.",
