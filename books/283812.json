  "description": "When you love your work, you never work a day—when you love your work partner, life gets complicated.  Finn Cooper is content to use their pyrokinesis fighting infernal forces on behalf of SPIRE. Their only problem is their lack of a psionic link to replace their little brother. And not having a dedicated anchor is taking a toll. Their struggle to control their abilities is impacting their job performance. And if they lose their job, that means they could lose custody of their little brother, Tim. Failure is not an option.  Oliver Hawkins wants to join SPIRE. Working with other psions appeals to him. He wants a job where his trans identity won’t hold him back from his career goals. His plans hit a speed bump when he learns his psionic abilities are too weak to qualify him for fieldwork. When a chance encounter brings the two of them together, Oliver’s aura draws Finn to him. They devise a plan to solve each other’s problems by forming a link bond. As Finn’s link, Oliver can join SPIRE and in return he will stabilize Finn’s volatile aura. That way Finn can regain control of their pyrokinesis and their life.  At first their solution seems perfect, but then work drama intrudes on the situation. Oliver suspects all is not as it seems with his new team and their mission. And when your work has fangs, claws, and venom, the drama can get intense. Throw in guardianship of a teenage math whiz and Finn’s life is about to get hectic.  This is a queer (M/NB) sci-fi/paranormal romance featuring a trans man and an asexual non-binary person who is raising their teenage brother after they lost their parents.",
