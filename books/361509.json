  "description": "When Officer Anthony Petrocelli literally drops down off his horse and lands at Kate Anderson's feet to announce he's her destiny, Kate figures it's just another typical day in New York. Besides, no hunky Italian on a stallion talking about his grandmother's \"marriage vision\" (in tea leaves, for crying out loud) is going to disrupt Kate's plans. And that's a prudent marriage to a corporate attorney (whose difficulties in the bedroom are sure to be temporary).Luckily, Anthony isn't in the market for a bride. He just wants the already-engaged Kate to meet his family and disprove their silly prediction once and for all. Problem is, steamy thoughts of Anthony have been running nonstop through Kate's head.

And that a cop named Anthony could be just what the Fates have planned for her after all...",
