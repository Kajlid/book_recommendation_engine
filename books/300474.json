  "description": "Training rescued hoomans is a stressful job, but somedoggy has to do it. The Finn Chronicles is a unique story told by an extraordinary dog. He’s irreverent, funny, and full of sass. Based on his real life, join Finn as he issues weekly reports back to K9 Rescue Headquarters on the strange behaviors and rituals of his rescue-hoomans. With sarcastic wit, he observes the curious world around him, heroically saves his unwitting hoomans from dangers (see also: evil electric toothbrush), and shares his musings about the often-lackluster level of service he feels he receives. With bonus content like links to Finn’s social media and videos, you’ll get to see this vocal and energetic dog in action. You’re sure to fall in love with Finn, his hilarious facial expressions, his tantrums and even his dim-witted hoomans. This is the light-hearted and funny read we need in these not so light-hearted times. Don't miss your chance to fall in love with Finn and follow him on social media for year round laughs and love!",
