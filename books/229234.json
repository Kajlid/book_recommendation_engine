He used to hunt terrorists, but now he investigates bank robberies for the New Tyco Planetary Bureau of Investigation, and avoids social contact outside of work. He only reluctantly attends his partner’s wedding out of politeness.But an unexpected kiss from a beautiful woman in a cab that night reawakens desires he’d thought gone forever after losing his wife to a terrorist’s bomb.Reeva Johannes is nursing her own wounds. A year earlier, the love of her life left for work and never came back. The investigation into his murder is ongoing, but her life is at a standstill. At least until she meets the gorgeous agent who’s been keeping her former lover’s case alive. It feels so wrong, lusting after the man so closely linked with Mac’s case, but for the first time since his murder, she feels something other than emptiness. And with Darius proving true all the rumors about male android sexual prowess, how can she say no?Yet with Darius’s nemesis determined to claim the one victim that got away, perhaps following passion isn’t such a good idea. For either of them.",
