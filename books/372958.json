  "title": "The Semi-Attached Couple & The Semi-Detached House",
  "description": "Born the daughter of Lord Auckland in 1797, Emily Eden was a witty nineteenth-century aristocrat whose two delightful novels were first presented to an admiring world one hundred and fifty years ago. These matching masterpieces satirize the social world Eden knew, loved, and laughed at. Like Jane Austen she is concerned with love and marriage, money and manners. But her voice is distinct. Eden's charm and humor - both above- and belowstairs - and her sharp social commentary make her work enduringly captivating.",
