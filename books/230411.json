  "title": "A Bitten Curse",
  "description": "I came to London to kill vampires. I failed. I woke up in my apartment days after our failed mission, alone and near death. Well, alone apart from the vampire King who has been in my head since he bit me that night.  I don't know how our minds became linked or how I survived that night when the rest of my team did not, but I've been in hiding for my life ever since.  My life now revolves around two things: staying alive and pissing off the bloodsucker in my head.  The only thing that drives him crazier than drinking myself unconscious?  F**king shifters.  A Bitten Curse is the first book in Nicole Marie's steamy paranormal romance series. New books to be released every few weeks. These books contain explicit scenes and adult language and are intended for mature audiences.",
