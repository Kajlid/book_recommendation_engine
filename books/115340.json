  "description": "Every year in the United Kingdom, around November through to February, snowfall will arrive. Usually, it is fairly localised and moderate. Nevertheless, every year when this sprinkling falls, all and sundry are taken by complete surprise and general chaos ensues. Transport links and infrastructure come under severe strain, even though the snow often quickly disappears within a few days. The BAA is on record as stating that they are overwhelmed by as little as six centimetres of snow lying at one of their airports.So, just what would happen, if, one winter, the snow didnâ€™t disappear, but kept falling - relentlessly - for more than just a few days?This is one account of what the consequences might be.Andrew Brady, a cold weather survival expert and RAF officer, is caught up in a fight for his life against the elements as the UK freezes and dies. He adopts Jane Kelly, a journalist and Chris Davies, a twelve year old whose mother has already succumbed to the cold. The story maps their struggle to escape from the UK by land and sea. It also maps the fates of everyday victims of the snow.Will they survive? Would anyone?",
