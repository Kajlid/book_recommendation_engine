  "title": "Murder and Mayhem in Seventeenth-Century Cambodia: Anthony van Diemen vs. King Ramadhipati I",
  "description": "This book tells the story of the conflict from 1636 to 1645 between Cambodia and the Dutch East India Company (VOC), which has the dubious distinction of being history's first conflict between a mainland Southeast Asian state and a European power. It affords a glimpse into the largely unknown period in Cambodian history between the fall of Angkor in the mid-fifteenth century and the arrival of the French in the late-nineteenth century.",
