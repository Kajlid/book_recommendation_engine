  "title": "The Flyleaf Killer",
  "description": "Who wants to be a millionaire? Everybody, you might suppose, but perhaps not via the path along which an unhappy young schoolboy chose to follow.A book lover and avid reader, Robert Strudwick came across a bookshop that shouldn’t exist. Although he hesitated before entering he did so anyway and became enthralled by an unusual volume which he set about acquiring with little thought of danger or possible consequences.What followed included sweet revenge on a number of enemies and the beginnings of a life of unimaginable power, wealth and success, but involved shocking criminality which inevitably put him at odds with the law and dreadful danger should he flout any of the rules by which he undertook to be governed.A taut and graphic schoolboy's terrifying dalliance with the supernatural guaranteed to capture the reader’s attention and to deliciously tickle his toes - especially at bedtime.",
