  "description": "Jem Farstar is a wizard that no one has ever been quite certain what to make of. From the time they were born, they've been the world's most confusing enigma...that no one knows about. Jem is a shapeshifter, you see, and a wizard besides, and while most wizards are known for their cunning and subtlety, Jem is...not. While not cursed, Jem somehow got the curse of absolute brutal honesty. It's just a personality trait at this point. At this particular point in time in their kingdom, prophecies are very fashionable. Every other day someone is issuing a new prophecy and heroes go gallivanting off to fulfill them. Until the day when a tiny, unknown prophetess named Kassandra, predicted the fall of the entire kingdom. It's up to Jem and the poor farmboy 'hero' to save the whole kingdom from ruin.",
