Not even when Lacy's indecent selfies appear on his phone. He's got an image and reputation to protect. Already a VP before age thirty, he doesn't need flirtatious and nosy Lacy to get close and discover his well hidden secret.  When hackers break into their company's network, Lacy and Brandon walk into a trap where Brandon's past catches up with him. What will he risk to free himself in a gamble that Lacy's flirting has turned to love and grant him his secret Christmas wish?  Perfect pair! No-smile boss meets ultimate flirt. â€“ Marie Dee  **CONTENT WARNING: Due to mature content, recommended for readers aged 18+**",
