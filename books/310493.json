  "title": "No Friend but the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison",
  "description": "“Our government jailed his body, but his soul remained that of a free man.” (From the foreword by Man Booker Prize-winning author Richard Flanagan)In 2013, Kurdish-Iranian journalist Behrouz Boochani was illegally detained on Manus Island, a refugee detention centre off the coast of Australia.He has been there ever since.This book is the result. Laboriously tapped out on a mobile phone and translated from the Farsi.It is a voice of witness, an act of survival. A lyric firsthand account. A cry of resistance. A vivid portrait of five years of incarceration and exile. Winner of the Victorian Prize for Literature, No Friend but the Mountains is an extraordinary account - one that is disturbingly representative of the experience of the many stateless and imprisoned refugees and migrants around the world.",
