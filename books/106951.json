  "description": "The book is a collection of short stories. The stories attempt to understand the emotions, feelings and thought process of its protagonists. Thats the underlying theme. The global audience can connect to most of the stories while some stories have a distinct Indian flavor to it. Some stories belong to the slipstream genre while some others are just absurd, weird and downright interesting.",
