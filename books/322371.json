  "description": "Devastated from loss and a broken marriage, Taylor Ross had closed off her heart in order to survive. All of that changes when the infamous Kyle Goldstein challenges Taylor to see the man beyond the office gossip. At the same time, Ian Horner has never hidden his admiration for Taylor. Even after their awkward first meeting at church, his steady faithfulness cannot be ignored. As Taylor allows her heart to beat again, feel again, and break again, she must also confront the pain of her fatherâ€™s abandonment twenty years earlier. Threats both old and new press in, and ancient family secrets refuse to remain hidden any longer. Taylor knows that God can make something beautiful out of nothing (ex nihilo), but can she set aside her past in order to embrace everything her heart has ever wanted?",
