  "description": "*Alternate Cover for ASIN:B00QQO392A*Sometimes love hurts in more ways than one, and Maya Joy Summers would learn this lesson the hard way when fate brought her and Caleb Greyson together for the first time.  With her car out of gas and her cell phone out of juice, Maya’s only concern was avoiding the pouring rain on her way home that night. She should have been more worried about the danger that lie ahead. Pulled into a secluded alley, held against her will, Maya fought her captor with all she had. But would she have any strength left to fight the man who came to her rescue?  Caleb was a powerful man who was determined to change Maya’s life forever, even if it was against her will. Would Maya have the courage to accept a lifestyle completely adverse to anything she'd ever known? Could she endure Caleb's unbearable demands if it meant finally having the family she had always longed for? Would her heart survive accepting his proposal?  This full novel is NOT a sweet romance. This book contains dubious consent, sexual arrangements outside of the main character romance, and explicit scenes in addition to firm spankings given with the intent to discipline, not arouse. It also includes light bondage and other situations that some may find difficult to read. If you are averse to severely dominant men who are in complete control of their women, this book is not for you, and I urge you to please find a book more suited to your taste.",
