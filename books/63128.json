  "description": "A wealthy heir to a flagging, multinational super-corporation is abducted from a seedy bar in the worst part of town, her feet covered in blood without a memory of what brought her there. A down-on-his-luck alcoholic detective sees it happen while in hiding from his estranged wife, the events all too similar to the case that has haunted his career. In captivity, everything she has ever known will fall apart. In finding her, his life will tumble into disarray, as he uncovers the Templeton Family Empire's darkest secret. A secret bought in blood.",
