  "description": "What Happens After You Catch A Dragon’s Tail? Mr. Winchester Lee represents a group in the Far East that is concerned that the New York Stock Exchange is being manipulated. He states that he has every confidence that Bart Northcote and his associates are up to the task. He seems to know every secret the office has tried to hide. He must also know that such a small firm is not equipped to handle such a gargantuan task. Mr. Lee is adamant that Bart must find his own way as not to give any indication that the conspiracy has been discovered. At the same time, Bart understands that Mr. Lee’s associates are betting on Bart to fail. After hiring a local contact in Hong Kong, everything seems to fit into place almost too easily. Another client of Bart’s firm is involved with the market manipulation. Mr. Lee is delighted with what Bart finds. The market is manipulated via a formula that makes it appear random. But Bart finds that he is being bugged and followed. He suspects his new associate. He wonders who he can really trust. His team scatters after being pursued by very motivated killers. The real question is how to resolve the situation without being liquidated.",
