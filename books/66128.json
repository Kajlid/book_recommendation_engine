  "description": "Time-quakes are disrupting Los Angeles in the sixties. A soul-scarred Vietnam vet takes a job as a time-raveler, sewing up the loose threads of unraveled lives, but now he's on a case that threatens to unravel his own life. Why are young men are disappearing from West Hollywood? Is there a serial killer preying on the nascent gay community? Or is there some darker force at work? A brilliant and disturbing short novel, gritty and realistic, filled with recognizable details. This crossover mix of science fiction and noir mystery evokes a not-yet-forgotten time and place on the threshold of change. Selected by Gardner Dozois for inclusion in The Year's Best Science Fiction: Twenty-Third Annual Collection (2006) and winner of the 2007 Spectrum Award for Best Short Fiction, it's a stunning depiction of a forgotten slice of gay life before Stonewall. In The Quake Zone is a journey into one man's heart of darkness and what it takes to come out the other side. This is David Gerrold writing at his passionate best. Contains mature material.",
