  "description": "Letting go isn’t the same thing as losing control.If things were different, maybe dominant Leo could date the woman he’s suddenly longing for, his free-spirited friend, Yvonne. For her, life is an adventure; for him, it’s all about work and keeping things simple so he can focus on his son.When a tragic event upends Leo’s orderly existence, he’s forced to admit he can’t do it all, and he can’t do it alone. Yvonne feels like exactly what Leo doesn’t need.Until that first touch. That first kiss. That first steamy night when he finds his perfect submissive.But she doesn’t fit in his well-ordered world, so he can’t ask her to stay. Can he?",
