  "title": "Prince of Malorn",
  "description": "With a tyrant threatening the throne, a young prince struggles to survive …Korram has the right to rule Malorn when he turns 18, but Regent Rampus has no intention of giving up power. In a desperate bid to recruit allies, Korram treks into the Impassable Mountains on a dangerous quest. But the reclusive Mountain Folk hate Lowlanders and have no interest in the prince's problems. To gain their trust, Korram must attempt the Rite of Acceptance, braving the blizzards and deadly snowcats of the upper slopes in a brutal ordeal of survival…all while avoiding the regent’s assassin.  Even if Korram survives the Impassables and earns the Mountain Folk’s help, he will have to lead a band of untrained hunters and gatherers against the full might of the Malornian military. If he fails, his enemy will seize Malorn as his own and crush them all. If you enjoy the finely crafted cultures and world-building of Mistborn, Song of the Lioness, or Farseer, you'll love the land of Malorn!
