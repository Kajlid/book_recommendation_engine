  "title": "The New Irish Table: 70 Contemporary Recipes",
  "description": "In The New Irish Table , author Margaret Johnson's love of Ireland permeates page after glorious page of mouthwatering Irish dishes. The 70 recipes reflect the traditions of the national cuisine and also showcase the most exciting new tastes from the home cooks and professional chefs who're part of the culinary renaissance in Ireland today. The time-honored fruits of land and sea, such as fluffy potatoes, plump fish, tender meats, and berries bursting with flavor, are interpreted anew in such dishes as Smoked Salmon Chowder, Filet of Baby Beef with Spinach-Bacon Stuffing and Guinness Mustard Sauce, and Raspberry Buttermilk Tarts. Lavish color photographs of the food, the landscapes, and the people are woven through the text, making The New Irish Table the next best thing to sitting down at a table in Ireland itself.",
