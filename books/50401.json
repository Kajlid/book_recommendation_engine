  "description": "Dear Author,I think this man is much more, or much less, than he seems. Who is he really, and who or what is he pretending to be? What sort of trouble will his secrets cause him? I'd be grateful if you could answer these questions for me.Photo Description: With a black sky dotted in luminescent stars framing him, a beautiful young man stares into the darkness, his face concentrated, as though his thoughts are with someone else. His golden hair reveals him as a stranger in a land so very far from anything he’s known, and yet he’s comfortable in the silk kimonos draping his body. He gently holds one between his fingers, as if caressing the skin of his lover. Strings of gold and jade earrings adorn him, tokens of affection from the one he waits for now.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is Always Write\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.Download the story, read it online or find it in Love Is Always Write: Volume 7.",
