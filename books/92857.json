  "description": "**NOW ONLY AVAILABLE AS PART OF LURED: HOLLOWAY PACK 2**Guilt is a heavy burden for the one carrying it. Jem Stonehouse is no exception to this rule. What if she’d acted sooner? What if she’d fully recognised the threat? What if she hadn’t allowed the male pack members to head into the witches’ ambush? For one, youngest pack member Josh Larsen wouldn’t be trapped in the sleep of the dead. Now, Jem is convinced it’s her job to bring him back to life no matter what it takes—learning more about her heritage, risking pack exposure, or travelling to places she couldn’t have imagined possible. Even if the journey endangers her soul.",
