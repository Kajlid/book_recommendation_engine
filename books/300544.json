Instead they are relegated to blood slaves to the vampires who reign in humanity's stead. Vampires like me. Under our rule, the world drips with blood and echoes with screams. I'm discontent, however, without answers regarding the past despite the fact that I, Elsie Crauford, am the uncontested heir to the vampiric throne. With the help of the blood witches, Draven and Crowe, as well as my human pet, Sebastian, I will discover the truth of my species' origin and the history of the world -- no matter what the cost. But those who created this dark world are not willing to see their own power ebb, and dangers lurk that even a vampire should fear under this Reign of Nightmares.**18+ Reverse Harem Dark Vampire Story***This book may contain scenes that some readers may find triggering.",
