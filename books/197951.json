  "title": "Small Town Ho: The Hilarious Story of Moving from the Big City to North Idaho",
  "description": "Have You Ever Wanted OFF the Treadmill ?? New author Duke Diercks bursts onto the scene with the hilarious memoir of one family’s move from the big city to the panhandle of North Idaho. No Jobs. No friends. Just buckets of our own ignorance. Follow along in horror and hilarity as the family acclimates to the new small town way of life and the author bounces from jobs working in a school cafeteria to selling women’s clothing in a call center to opening a barbecue restaurant. Written in a smart, self-deprecating, salty style, Small Town Ho is all at once poignant and laugh-out-loud funny, full of the struggle of an ordinary family consisting of three boys, one big black lab, one assassin of a cat, and two very tired parents.",
