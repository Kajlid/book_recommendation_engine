  "description": "Caroline Whitmore is cunning, inconsiderate, and ruthless.Despite that, I can’t recall a day when I haven’t thought about her at least once. On paper, we’re a perfect match—Only on paper. In real life, we’re a disaster. She hates me. Hates the way I dress—everything I say. My basic existence. But what I hate is more complicated. Because I’m a moth to a gorgeous, petite, brunette flame. I hate that I still remember what she wore the day we sat together in sixth grade. And that I would move mountains for her smile. I hate every guy that gets too close. And that one of them gets to stay. I hate that I want her so bad that I used my best friend to make her jealous. But most of all, I hate that Caroline Whitmore is the one that got away.",
