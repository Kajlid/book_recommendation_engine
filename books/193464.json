  "title": "The Most Dangerous Enemy: A History of the Battle of Britain",
  "description": "'The magnitude and vital importance of the Battle of Britain has found a superb chronicler in Stephen Bungay' Andrew RobertsStephen Bungay's magisterial history is the definitive book about this central event in Britain's history and mythology. Unrivalled for its synthesis of all previous historical accounts, for the acuity and intelligence of its strategic analysis and its sheer narrative drive, it is a book ultimately distinguished by the trenchancy of its conclusions -- that it was the British in the Battle who displayed all the virtues of efficiency, organisation and even ruthlessness we habitually attribute to the Germans, and they who fell short in their amateurism, ill-preparedness, engineering sub-standards and even in their old-fashioned notions of gallantry.An addictive read and gripping throughout, this book is a classic of military history.Stephen Bungay is Director of the Ashridge Strategic Management Centre in London. He is the author of Alamein (Aurum) and Making Strategy Happen (Nicholas Brealey 2009.) Since the first publication of The Most Dangerous Enemy in 2000, the author has become a respected authority in television documentaries, and lectures on the Battle to the RAF itself.",
