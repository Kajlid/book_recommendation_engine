And why are the sidewalks of The Castro suddenly so fabulous, anyway?You don't have be an LGBTQutie-patootie to shake your booty. Just ask the Wizard, or anyone who's read his latest Wizard Tale. Better yet, read it yourself!By popular demand, The Wizard Takes a Fitness Class is also longer than the first wizard story--much longer. Cover art is once again by Nik Caesar, this time with color by John Hageman.If you can't exorcise your demons, why not exercise with them?",
