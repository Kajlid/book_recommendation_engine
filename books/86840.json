  "description": "A killer is stalking the mean streets of New Rochdale.Two policemen are viciously slaughtered in a seemingly opportunistic attack by the most malevolent serial killer ever to grace the Kindle. (Even Hannibal the Cannibal wouldn’t sit next to him at the annual Fictional Serial Killers banquet. Hannibal ended up sitting between a murderer from a season finale of CSI: Miami and a kid from Scream 3. It wasn’t a pleasant evening. Then they served roasted census taker with baked beans and a substandard Bordeaux. Hannibal said they could stuff it next year.)The world has already seen crime-cracking double acts from Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, to Cagney and Lacey, and to Ant and Dec. Now from the bowels of the New Rochdale Police Department come the inscrutable team of Detective Sergeant Nugus Bottomley and, his new recruit, Detective Constable Padraic Evans.They think the cop killings tie in with an audacious train robbery from the 1980’s – a heist of silver bullion, denied by the government, a robbery that never was!Armed to the back molars, the beer swilling, charismatic Nugus and the nerdish, neurotic Padraic take on the case of a lifetime, not realising that it could mean the end of their lives.A host of memorable characters, including two capricious undertakers, a local crime boss and his Hollywood starlet daughter, and a bent copper, are only too happy to confuse matters for Nugus and Padraic, who have enough to worry about when a TV crew want to film the dynamic duo at work.Then a mysterious stranger starts leaking blood, and other bodily fluids, everywhere.A twisted plot – gruesome murders, a creepy secret prison cell, a dangerous doner kebab and an ice cream van.NRPD: The mean streets – You may die laughing.",
