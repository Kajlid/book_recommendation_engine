  "title": "Strange Things Sometimes Still Happen: Fairy Tales from Around the World",
  "description": "Open up Strange Things Sometimes Still Happen and enter a fantastic world of fairy tales, a world of mischievous maids, wily women, enchantresses, midwives, and crones. Here is a treasure trove of tales that could only have been put together by the celebrated Angela Carter, whom Salman Rushdie called the \"high sorceress\" and the \"benevolent witch queen\" of English literature.With an eye for the bizarre, an ear for the eccentric, and a longstanding fascination with the female dominated tradition of story telling, Carter has chosen forty-five tales from twenty-three cultures that revel in women's cunning and high spirits, wisdom and imagination.Young women outwit men, magicians, even the devil himself. Old women bring enchantment, luck, and sound advice. Midwives talk to frogs, girls marry snakes, justice is almost always done, and things are not always what they seem in Strange Things Sometimes Still Happen.Complemented by exquisite woodcuts by Corinna Sargood, this generous offering of wit, witchery, and old-fashioned common sense will delight Angela Carter's many fans, and thoroughly entrance anyone who knows that fairy tales were never meant just for children.",
