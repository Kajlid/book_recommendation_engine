Here in Vegas, they call her Destiny, but I know exactly who she really is. Lexi Cruz and her father ruined my life. They blackmailed me for millions. And then, when I refused to pay them another dime, they murdered my old lady and our unborn son. The only thing that has kept me going for the last few months is vengeance. I live and breathe for the day I’ll finally get my revenge. Guilt eats away at me a little more with each day that passes until there’s nothing left of the man I used to be. I’m ready for my dance with Destiny; to finally put an end to the suffering. But there are two sides to every story. And it turns out that Destiny may have a few secrets up her sleeve, secrets that will actually give me something worth living for again.
