Deacon being in his home starts to open him up--and open his eyes to the man Deacon hides from the rest of the world. Without seeing it coming, Taber soon craves more. A lot more.Now if only Deacon can get Taber to see that it isn't so bad having him there to assist. Even if and maybe especially when Taber is naked, dripping wet, and angry as hell.",
