  "description": "LIFE IS ALL WE HAVE ... ONE CONVERSATION AT A TIME.Police officer Stephanos Stephanidou is given a dead-end posting to a small Greek island. It has an ageing population and all the young people have left. In despair, he considers that his career is over, and possibly his life, too. With nothing to do and no crime to involve himself with, he reads some old files and a cold-case from many years ago sparks his interest. He’s walking on the cliffs above the beautiful Mediterranean coast when he meets one of the case’s main players. This could be the key to his solving the cold case mystery and reviving his career. As the story unfolds, and the clues have to be found, Stephanidou finds new hope. Time is all he has, but can he solve this old crime before time runs out.",
