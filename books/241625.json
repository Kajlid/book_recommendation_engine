  "description": "Love is blind, and it will take over your mind… Jaleiya Montgomery’s life has been anything but easy. With a mother who wished she was never born and no other real family to lean on, she found solace in her high school sweetheart Jamel Jones. Tired of feeling like she wasn’t good enough, Jaleiya was ready to end it all, but Jamel showed her that she had every reason to live. He became her safe-haven, but as the years passed, Jamel changed into a complete stranger, leaving Jaleiya to try and keep up with the man he was becoming. With his new possessive personality and their relationship quickly taking a turn for the worst, Jaleiya is left to try and find her own independence but is quickly reminded that she made a promise—no matter what…they were in this forever.",
