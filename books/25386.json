  "description": "Scott Boscoe is on a rollercoaster to gain his independence as he preps to start his next chapter in life. He's inches away from getting a degree in a highly esteemed Californian college, and he's just been promoted at a job he hasn't even started yet. Success and freedom from a prejudiced, stifling grandfather seems right around the corner.However, a lie he's been hiding behind since high school has resurfaced, one he thought he dusted under the rug years ago. Now he's falling back on a deal he made with David \"After\" Despu√©s, his childhood ex-best friend turned celebrity and household name.Through the course of Scott cashing in his favor, and After making the best of it for his own gain, both of them get stuck learning a difficult lesson: you can make all the promises in the world as a kid to be there for your best friend...but what about after?--For readers who enjoyed Red, White & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston, Boyfriend Material by Alexis Hall, and the Simon Snow trilogy by Rainbow Rowell -- What About After is full of romance, drama, and comedy, with an occasionally unreliable, witty main character who loves to throw out a side (or snide) comment to the reader. What About After has everything from fake dating, strong family bonds, and friends-to-enemies-to-friends again...to maybe something more. (That neither Scott nor After are willing to admit to.)",
