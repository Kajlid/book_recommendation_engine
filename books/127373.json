As a newly turned vampire, Stanley joins Geoff on a complex mission of murder and vengeance as they hunt each member of the Gandy family one by one, wiping the entire bloodline from existence.Or so they thought.Over a century later, Stanley must return to his hometown of Meyers to hunt the remaining Gandy descendant, Amanda.
