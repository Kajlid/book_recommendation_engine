  "description": "The Network Being a vampire in the 21st century is not as easy as one might think, especially when the vampire has decided to become part of society once more. Social security numbers, driver's licenses, and vehicle registrations are some of the every day things that modern day vampires have to get around. After all, government officials start to suspect something's up when the same name pops up over centuries. Gathering some of the most talented people in the world, Khalida has created the Network. Their only job is to protect Khalida and keep her from being discovered, and they are good at it. The Family After thousands of years of hiding, running and fighting, Khalida finally finds people she can trust; people she can love. A select few, she considers to be family. Raymond, Jake, Mack, Marlene, and a few others, will become something she never fully had; a family. She will do anything to protect them. Anything The Past Being a vampire does not come without its downfalls. Enemies have been made and alliances have been broken. Khalida's secrets from her past may very well topple everything she's built and destroy the family she loves. Ultimately, she will have to choose between a past she's protected her entire life and the family that has sacrificed everything for her.",
