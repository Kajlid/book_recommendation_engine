We’ve done it before, and it should be easy. But the one thing I didn’t count on when I flew to the other side of the country to take her place was Hudson. Now, the irresistible hockey player has me thinking maybe I need more in my dreams.\nHudson\nLorelei is colder than the ice she skates on, and I’ve never been tempted to give her a second glance…until now. Suddenly, something about her is different, and I can’t help the need to know what’s changed. When I finally confront her at a party, I learn the beauty who’s captured my attention isn’t Lorelei at all. Now, Cara has me questioning the future I’ve been working toward my entire life, I think she might be the missing piece.",
