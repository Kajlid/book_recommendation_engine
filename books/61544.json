  "description": "This book is a smart, adrenaline infused action ride. These unique and experimental action stories cut right to the action and never let go, filling the reader with eager anticipation and excitement.This is a hungry reader's buffet of dark and foreboding horror / action mixed with sarcastic and hilarious crime noir. BLEEDING OUT is an edgy story bridging the gap between action and horror, dealing with a father's struggle to survive against a flesh eating virus. On the other hand, WE WERE THE PEOPLE is a tongue in cheek exploitation of the modern crime story, complete with outlandish dialogue, explosive battles, unforgettable characters and taboo topics. SABACHO is a sister story dealing with the formation of one of the main characters. THE CHURCH is a psychological conflict between a preacher's vows and his own conscience. And THE JOURNAL OF THOMAS RED is a history buffâ€™s dream come true. The story is loosely based on the real southern hero, Lewis Redmond, and his exploits and confrontations with the American government post civil war. Finally, PINE NEEDLES is a terrifying look into the mind of a deranged killer in southern Appalachia.Filled with memorable characters, intense gun fights, witty dialogue and much more, these stories read more like a movie than a book, allowing even the most impatient reader to envision the action frame by frame. This collection is a treat for anyone interested in action / adventure, crime noir, politically taboo topics or just an exciting read.",
