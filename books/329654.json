  "description": "And the honor of Omega of the Year goes to... knot me.That title goes to my twin sister who is everything a top pack could want. Me? I've never been good at being an omega and have no desire to match with a pack. Especially not the pack of Alphaball players who have their sights set on my sister.When I match with Beck, Rylan, Rio, and Kane I'm left with little choice but to see the match through.But their pack is in for quite the surprise...I'm knot so perfect and maybe they aren't either.* Knot So Perfect Omega is a reverse harem standalone and contains adult content.",
