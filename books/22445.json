  "description": "Available at https://www.smashwords.com/books/view...The atoms that compose your body were around long before you were born and will remain long after you're dead. Their brief sojourn with you is a tiny episode within their life in this universe. This short story traces the path of a single hydrogen atom from the Big Bang to the edge of the universe. If we could ask an atom to recount its adventures perhaps this is the story it would tell.This is a short story of about 4600 words.Â Excerpt:\"There were still other particles in this universe besides us protons. We called them the short life particles because they would spring into existence and then decay in only a few short trillionths of a second. 329 and I would often watch as they quickly appeared and then vanished, leaving faint bursts of light all around us. Whenever we drifted a bit from the crowd we could see them even more clearly and it was quite beautiful. It was said that none of us protons would live forever, and that one day each of us would decay as the short life particles did. Decay was a random process, meaning no proton could know the exact moment of their own decay. All we could do was hope that it would not happen for a very long time. In fact I wasn't quite convinced it would ever happen. No one had ever actually seen a proton decay, and so perhaps we would live forever.\"",
