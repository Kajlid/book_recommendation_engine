  "description": "Tajore Arkle is a world filled with sand and dust. Sweetwater is collected from seeps in dark caves where Manna, the major food source, also grows. Anya is too young to work in the quarry collecting stone like her parents, and she and her sister Zue are responsible for collecting the supplies. Zue is the only person with whom Anya shares her dreams. They are strange dreams; dreams of a blue sky and blue water and birds and animals that no one has heard of. Zue warns Anya to keep these dreams to herself so that she will not be teased. Anya follows her advice until one day she warns others of the accident in the quarry. People laugh but when the accident happens Anya is accused of causing it and is ostracised until a trader comes to take her to 'the mountain'. On the mountain Anya meets others like herself and is welcomed with open arms. She soon learns to understand her dreams as 'memories' of another time. She meets Ib, the only other young person on the mountain. Convinced of the existence of a third 'pastseer' like themselves they journey to 'the rift', a wasteland which circumnavigates the planet, to find this third person. Poisoned by the plants that existthere anyone who travels into 'the rift' dies. Anya and Ib are certain their friend has found a way to live in 'the rift' unharmed and plan to find her and bring her back to 'the mountain'.",
