  "description": "Eight years have passed since Colin and Caroline “Charlie” ended their college romance. A chance meeting reunited them confirming that time had not diminished their love for each other. Now, they have to turn their passionate reunion into a legitimate and sustainable relationship. Charlie’s medical practice is in Houston. Colin is the starting quarterback for Dallas. Distance is not the only obstacle to their happiness. There’s Colin’s (maybe?) ex-girlfriend, entertainment reporter Sasha Stone, who’s granted the first ever tell-all interview about Colin’s personal life. There’s Charlie’s father who is part owner of their medical practice and blames Colin for Charlie’s battle with an eating disorder. What about the demands of the media and Colin’s rabid fans? “From Now Until Infinity” continues the journey of Colin and Charlie that began, ended, and began again in “Falling Into Infinity.”",
