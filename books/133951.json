  "title": "TRAVELS IN SOUTH AMERICA",
  "description": "This is an account of the author's two year journey on a shoestring through South America during which time he visited some of the most remote regions of the Amazon basin, staying at times with primitive native indian tribes. To finance his onward travels he worked for a time catching dolphins on the Amazon and then with the Pacific fishing fleet off the coast of Peru. Aspiring to be the first man to navigate a balsa wood raft down the Rio Santiago in Ecuador he was shot at on the Peruvian border in alligator-infested waters and arrested as an Ecuadorian spy! After a spell in jail he was expelled from Peru and continued his journey through the Paraguayan Chaco and across the Andes. At times he slept at the roadside on the ground in freezing temperatures. This book shows that anyone can travel wherever they want if they set their mind to it and are prepared to suffer a degree of hardship.",
