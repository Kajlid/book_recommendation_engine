  "description": "Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found hereTrapped-Legend is the 3rd book in the Legend series, although each of the first three books stand on their own.Magical powers, a castle, and a charming prince sound like the ingredients for a fairy-tale life, but for BJ Mulroy, reality turns out to be a whole lot more complicated.BJ is a Fios, which means she can see both the Seelie and the Unseelie Fae even when they invoke the Feth Fiada that makes them invisible to most humans. She hadn’t asked for the magical power, and often she wishes she couldn’t see the evil drones who are appearing more and more often in our human world. But see them she does, and she can’t ignore the danger they pose—nor her responsibility as a Fios to combat the Dark Fae.The castle is Castlesand, the ancestral home of her new husband, Brian, a warm and caring Druid high priest with only a few months to live. Though they care for each other, the marriage is a strategic alliance rather than a love match. Brian needs BJ’s help in making sure Castlesand doesn’t fall into the clutches of a dangerous relative who wants the estate no matter what he has to do and who he has to hurt—including Brian and BJ—to get it.The charming prince is Danté, a Fae royal who is too attractive for any woman’s sanity. But while she’s as hot-blooded as the next woman. BJ does not want to be the plaything of an immortal prince, no matter how yummy he is. Besides, there’s the matter of the seventeenth-century hunk in the painting.",
