Cian is the Chosen—the only being capable of initiating the unfolding of the events foretold in the Prophecy. However, he must claim a female mate first. After waiting centuries for his partner to be born, she would have to be his equal—as powerful as he—physically capable of handling the daemon possessing him, capable of freeing him from the immortal Droughan. However, the Fates gave him Candace, a young, inexperienced witch who looks more like an ethereal fairy than the first-level witch entrusted with an ancient power. She is a virgin, and Cian and his best friend Regan have to initiate her through the Trinity Ceremony. Will the two alpha males be able to share Candace, thereby sexually enhancing her to make her physically capable of handling the daemon that possesses Cian? \n\"Imagine a soul-mate reaching deep into your dreams, someone who waited centuries for you. That's Cian, the ultimate lover and consummate hero on so many levels. Candace, the spunky virgin witch with powers to fulfill an ancient prophecy, was nothing the wizards expected and everything Cian and Regan needed. Would two alpha males share sex to keep the woman they needed safe and the world from destruction? I raise questions and the characters answer them.\" ~ Eliza ~ \n A Siren Erotic Romance",
