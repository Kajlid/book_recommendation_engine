  "description": "Sierra Clarkson thought she’d found the perfect way to serve her country without having to join the military...until she was kidnapped right from the base in Afghanistan she was working on. Even worse, no one knew she’d been taken and no one was looking for her. Except someone was. The tall, very confident in himself, Delta Force soldier she’d met one day on base a year or so ago. Fred “Grover” Groves hadn’t ever forgotten the red-headed spitfire working in the chow hall. And once he discovered she hadn’t simply blown off his advance by not getting in touch with him when he went home, and she was, in fact, kidnapped...nothing would keep him from finding her and bringing her home. But Sierra wasn’t exactly a damsel in distress, and Grover would find that out first hand. He’s never loved a woman more…but neither would have a future together if they didn’t work together to battle a common enemy. ** Shielding Sierra is the 8th and final book in the Delta Team Two Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.",
