  "title": "Not Norman: A Goldfish Story",
  "description": "\"A sweet story that could be used as a springboard to discussion of the pitfalls of making snap judgments about pets — or people.\" — School Library JournalNorman the goldfish isn’t what this little boy had in mind. He wanted a different kind of pet — one that could run and catch, or chase string and climb trees, a soft furry pet to sleep on his bed at night. Definitely not Norman. But when he tries to trade Norman for a \"good pet,\" things don’t go as he planned. Could it be that Norman is a better pet than he thought? With wry humor and lighthearted affection, author Kelly Bennett and illustrator Noah Z. Jones tell an unexpected — and positively fishy — tale about finding the good in something you didn’t knowyou wanted.",
