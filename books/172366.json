  "description": "Lone Wolf, Book 2 Sherri Walker quit her job and changed her zip code for a man who is often known to howl at the moon. When she trips over a dead body and her criminal ex pops up, she’s forced to confront her past and take a detour from her spontaneous future. Suddenly nothing is clear and Sherri questions an already unlikely relationship. Is Ash her future, or is the danger of loving a werewolf too much to handle? Even though he’s left his pack, Asher Hughes still values family. His sister-in-law needs protection, but the new love in his life may be in danger as well. Sherri’s ex is whispering lies in her ear, and Ash is feeling pulled between old loyalties, and the chance at a new beginning with the human he wants. It’s enough to make anyone, man or beast, go crazy.",
