  "description": "May, 1536. The poet Sir Thomas Wyatt, released from imprisonment in the Tower of London, is in his father's custody. Almost from almost the beginning of his life, Tom has loved his cousin Anne Boleyn, content to sit at her feet while she sang her love songs to another, if doing so gave him just a moment in her company. Now he is heartsick and despairing, having witnessed her juridical murder by Henry VIII. Only wanting to escape from the recent memories now rending his heart, Tom recounts his story, a story which also narrates the tragic tale of Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII.",
