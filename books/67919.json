The book is a feast to be savored, whether your desires lean toward the bottom, the top, or you are simply curious. \"Quiet\" by Andrea Zanin will prepare you for all that is to come, and whether your interests lie in the loving submission of Lawrence Westerman’s \"Her Majesty’s Plaything,\" boys wrestling for the opportunity to please their mistress in Laura Antoniou’s \"Blame Spartacus\" or the ultimate domination of Valerie Alexander’s \"La Sexorcista,\" you will find what you’re looking for, and more - under her thumb. From a foreword by Midori to stories by greats like Rachel Kramer Bussel, D. L. King, Teresa Noelle Roberts, Dominic Santi and more, you won’t want to put the book down; but you’ll have to - from time to time.",
