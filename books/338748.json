  "description": "“As he did in Marley , Grogan makes readers feel they have a seat at the family dinner table….4 stars.”— People   John Grogan, author of the phenomenal #1 New York Times bestseller, Marley & Me , once again takes readers into his past, his memories, and his heart in The Longest Trip Home —a funny and poignant memoir of faith, family, and identity. A New York Times bestseller in its own right, The Longest Trip Home has earned glowing accolades from the critics (“Genuinely heartrending,” — New York Times “Wry and witty,” — Washington Post ; “Entertaining, funny, and, best of all, always honest at its core,” — St. Louis Post-Dispatch ). And, just as Marley & Me was more than simply “a dog book,” John Grogan’s Longest Trip is much, much more than your typical story of a boy’s coming-of-age.",
