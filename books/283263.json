  "title": "A Law Unto Himself",
  "description": "The third book in Mark Warren's historical fiction trilogy ends with a bang. In Tombstone, Arizona Territory, despite a silver strike promising entrepreneurial opportunities, Wyatt Earp returns to law enforcement, posing a new threat to the Cow-boy rustlers running rampant on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border. The Earp brothers make as many enemies as they do allies in a deeply divided community. Aspiring to be county sheriff, Wyatt bargains with outlaw informants in his pursuit of three wanted men. When the deal unravels, the Cow-boy traitors fear retribution from their own, planting the seed for the thirty seconds that will ensure Wyatt Earp his place in history-the gunfight that erupts behind the O.K. Corral. What follows-assassination and swift justice-guarantees that Wyatt Earp's name will forever serve as one standard within the debate of law versus order.",
