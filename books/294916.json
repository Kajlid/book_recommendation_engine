  "description": "I wasn't looking for love, and then Rowan followed me into that dark alley. I have gaps in my memory, and by gaps I mean that I don't remember anything from before about ten years ago. All I know for sure is that I'm a vampire... and I'm trying not to kill people any more. So when Rowan followed me out of the AA meeting and into that dark alley, I had to fight every impulse I have not to drain him dry. Aside from being adorably sexy, he has a scent that drives me wild, and only some of that is sexual. I  know  his scent, or at least part of it, but do you think I can remember how? Like a sore tooth that your tongue can't help but play with, Rowan's scent is both tantalising and annoying, and I wasn't going to let it go until I'd figured it out. But by then the night was ending, and I was out of time. I ran, resolving to forget about the man who makes me quiver on every level. I didn't trust myself, didn't dare trust that I could control my thirst, because the alternative was devouring the love of my life. But how could I possibly stay away? Content warning : This novel contains implied and explicit sex scenes, is peppered with naughty words, has strong female characters who aren't afraid to be vulnerable, and is recommended for a mature audience. Careful, you may just meet your new book boyfriend.",
