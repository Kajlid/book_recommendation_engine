  "description": "Crippled by a devastating stammer, Alfie would prefer to hide himself away in the audience of London's theaters. But as the perfect Georgian gentleman, it's his responsibility to find a husband for his ward Eleanor. The pain of having to converse with strangers is lessened by the appearance of the kind-hearted Lord George Caldwell and his cousin Lieutenant Markham, who is far more interesting than any character Alfie has seen on stage, and far more intriguing than any man he's ever met in person.",
