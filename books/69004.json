  "description": "Early one morning, Times-Picayune crime reporter Nola Cespedes goes for her regular run in Audubon Park. More than the heat of the dawning New Orleans day, she’s trying to escape her growing unease with the man she’s seeing. Instead, Nola finds herself at the scene of a crime—and she knows the victim: Judith Taffner, her former journalism professor at Tulane.Not one to put much trust in the good old boys of the NOPD, Nola takes it upon herself to investigate. She discovers that Taffner was working on two explosive stories, both of which would shock even a city known for corruption. And when an apparently related murder occurs at the New Orleans Jazz Fest, Nola realizes it’s only a matter of time before she becomes the killer’s next target. Rich with details of New Orleans and featuring an original, tough heroine as fascinating and complicated as the city itself, Nearer Home is the engaging and powerful follow-up to Hell or High Water.",
