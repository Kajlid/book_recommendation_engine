  "description": "So now you’re the Alpha.For neophyte werewolf Hanna Harvey, life is a wedge of triple crème room-temperature brie. Sure, there’s a crew of Furries aggressively adoring her right there in the bakery aisle and not everyone is excited about the abrupt change of command within the shifter kingdom, but what’s the occasional run-in with a cat-suit wearing lady assassin when you have a pygmy goat coffee butler—with a sweater vest!Only, the threats have become a smidge too frequent—and graphic—and Abernathy is on high alert. Which, for a six-and-a-half-foot tall werewolf, looks a lot like making end tables with the spines of your enemies. Super awkward when it comes time for entertaining—which is exactly what Hanna has in mind for Abernathy’s upcoming birthday.The party plans come to a screeching halt when ex-detective Morrison—now a cryptid conspiracy-obsessed freelance paranormal PI—insists that her life is in imminent danger (again). When a powerful enemy from Hanna’s past re-surfaces, she’s tempted to tap into the magic of an ancient ally.",
