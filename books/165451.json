  "description": "Book 1 of the 4-book series The Stark Affair by Skylar Cross  Colton Stark is filthy rich. A billionaire playboy who drives fast and plays hard, he enjoys an endless stream of party girls at the South Beach nightclub he owns.  But behind his chiseled face and tall muscular frame, Colton Stark is a man with a dirty secret. Not only is he on Miami-Dade Police Department's list of suspected narcotics traffickers, his devotion to the mysterious Talon Group is leading him to a fateful and permanent decision.  Tough girl cop Sofia grew up on the mean streets of Miami, unafraid to kick anyone's ass. When asked to investigate Colton, she doesn't even consider it a challenge.  Until she comes face-to-face with his penetrating blue eyes.  After a steamy meeting, Sofia finds herself playing a dangerous but sexy game with her own principles.  WARNING: My books are the raw, unfiltered vision of a slightly schizophrenic, sex-obsessed, vodka-swilling \"living contradiction\" with profanity issues. They are often unrealistic (translation: FUN) depictions of what life would be like if erotic romance fantasies came true, so sometimes... gasp!... things happen that aren't \"realistic\". (You know, kind of like how dull boring everyday life is realistic. Seriously, do you want to read about that?) If you are offended by the excessive use of dirty words, crass descriptions, or crude stream-of-consciousness writing laced with potty-mouthed expressions and graphic descriptions of non-traditional carnal delight, then you need to RUN from my writing right now! Don't say you weren't warned. (Oh, and you'd better be over 18! Don't even think about buying my books if you aren't.)  Approximate length: 16,000 words (a novella)  Book 2 is now available: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OYTK02Q",
