  "description": "Dani’s life is going great. She’s close to her family, gets good grades, and her boyfriend Reese is awesome. Except he’s really not, but no one knows that. The night a handsome boy named Max saves her from nearly drowning, Dani is immediately attracted to the new kid in town and, even though she has a boyfriend, she can’t get him out of her mind. The People of the Sea have lived beneath the waves for millennia, since the night Atlantis sunk and the goddess Amphitrite turned the survivors into mercreatures. Although the Mers occasionally find themselves in a position to interact with humans, they strive to remain undiscovered. When Dani and Max break into the local aquarium to free a mysterious creature that washed up on the shores of New Atlantis, Dani is forced to confront everything she thought she knew about the world. What do you do when everything you thought you knew turns out to be wrong?",
