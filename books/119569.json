  "description": "“You are Cub,” Nico repeats. “If they really have a problem with it when your brother’s older, just beat your brother. You can do it easily enough. If you truly want your family’s name and title, take it,” he says, turning to look me in the eyes. “Show them just how much you deserve it.”  “But I'm female,” I say.  “Who cares?” he asks, going back to his shadow searching. “You worked hard for that title. You were acceptable as an heir before your brother was born, right? Well if you exceed as much as I know you will, you’ll be acceptable even after it. But none of this bowing down, none of this letting people take what you want or force what they want on you. You're a super villain, you do what you want.”",
