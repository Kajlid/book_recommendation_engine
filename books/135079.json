Many would describe him as a bulldog of a man with a strong moral streak.

But when his drinking and obsession with the horrific nature of the crimes involved cloud his judgement, the case is thrown out of court and a cold-blooded killer goes free.Shattered and mired in self-pity, Jake withdraws from his family and takes off for Key West where he builds a small practice fighting marine insurance companies. One night, still haunted by his failures, Jake stumbles upon a covert meeting between Attorney General Benjamin Matthews, the man who fired him, and the serial killer he let go free.What follows is Jake’s fight for redemption and his life as he unravels a Machiavellian plot that leads from Key West to the White House.This is the first book in the Jake Sullivan Series.
