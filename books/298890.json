Talk about awkward.Other than the constant cockblock routine, I'm okay with him playing bodyguard. Together we make a damn good team—when he listens.Who am I kidding? He never listens, and I'm so going to shoot him in the ass.Trust In Lust is the first book in a reverse harem * Why Choose * PNR series. Suitable for readers 18+.",
