  "description": "Drake Copeland never knew his father. His mother disappeared years ago. So the day Drake and three classmates are stuck in the classroom while the rest of the school gets a field trip, it’s just one more time he’s been left behind. But when a bullied genius leaves his experiment running in the lab and throws the whole school through time, getting left behind is the least of their problems. Drake and his friends crash into a burned-out wasteland where their town used to be, discovering cannibals, starving werewolves, vampires, wise ghosts and a dark army directly connected to their own time - and maybe their own school.",
