  "description": "Well, hello, Sugar, my name is Joanna… That’s the introduction that all my victims get. It’s nice to be polite. Even serial killers have manners.  I know what I do isn’t normal, but I also know that I do the country a service.  And the world is better off with me in it. You’ll understand. See, I was once the victim. Hurt by the one who should have taken care of me. Let down by the system that should have protected me. Now I vow to help others, and if I have to hurt people to do it. I will.",
