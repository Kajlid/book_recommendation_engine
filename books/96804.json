  "description": "Boys of war suck at romance.Charity Delyle has lived in the shadow of her Prodigy cousin and his powerful Guard since the day she was born. And she doesn’t mind — really. Except that being in Hunter’s shadow means that he can’t see her. And she’d like that to change.Hunter has one purpose in Protect the Prodigy, or die trying. That means a social life, school, and even Charity come last until the war is over. For the most part, he’s okay with that — he can lose everything if he has to… except his seer.Starting at a new school should be much safer than living in a war-ravaged Carules headquarters. But this new school is different than the others. Friendships are forged and destinies are questioned, and Hunter’s decision could cost them all everything they’ve been hoping for.",
