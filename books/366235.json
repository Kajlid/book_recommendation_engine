  "description": "She asked for it, she got it....Anna Munson is constantly pestering the powers-that-be for true love and, quite frankly, Cupid's had it up to here. In fact, he's so fed up that he sends her an arrow of true love even though she hasn't proven herself worthy. Worse, he does it while she's on her first date with Nick Wells -- and Nick is barely worthy of true like. Cupid's rash behavior could cost him his wings if discovered by his higher-ups. But hopefully Nick and Anna will ruin their relationship before that happens. They are human, after all.He just got caught in the crossfire.Anna has never felt this kind of love before. To her own surprise (and Cupid's despair) it changes her. Completely. And Nick starts feeling kind of weird. He was just looking for some regular sex and a few laughs, but all this unconditional love and acceptance is throwing him off his game. Watching closely, Cupid knows exactly what's going on...and he doesn't like it. Not one bit. A little kernel has started to grow inside Nick's heart, and it could turn into something wonderful. But do Nick and Anna stand a chance with an ornery Cupid rooting against them?",
