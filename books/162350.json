  "description": "A pair of glass slippers that can change her life? When something is too good to be true, it usually is... Adelaide has lived her entire life cursed with a birthmark that makes people shy away. When an invitation to the Elder Princeâ€™s ball falls in her lap, she knows attending would only cause people to shun her more. A fairy godmother feels her pain and offers her a pair of glass slippers that not only transform her ragged dress to an elegant gown, but also removes the mark that covers her face. However, Adelaide soon learns that the beautiful slippers can steal away more than just her birthmark, leaving her cursed in a far worse way. This retelling of the classic Cinderella story will resound with readers of young adult fiction who love paranormal fantasy, fairy tales, and a splash of romance.",
