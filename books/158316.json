  "description": "If Leigh has learned anything this summer, it’s that magic can be chaotic. Despite some headline making disasters in her last diary, Leigh is eternally hopeful. With Four-bitten Fangtasy behind her, Leigh decides to write a little paranormal erotica with her newest disasterpiece, Bangin’ the Billion-were. She even takes on a rehash of the popular YA dystopian genre, in her novella Regurgitant. It seems that even the editing of other author’s writing can make her unwittingly fire up her literal-witchcraft. Leigh finds out how bad things can get when her friends ask her to edit their own cowboy-biker book, Steel Stetsons. Despite the flurry of writing, Leigh’s romantic heart is racing. Her boyfriend, Hunter will finally graduate from the Chicago Police Academy. Will Leigh and Hunter finally be able to enjoy some quality time on a camping trip? What will Leigh think of Hunter’s unique family? What is Luna capable of when pushed to an act of desperation? It seems Randy “Johnson” (Designer at Paranormal Chic) and Gertie have unwittingly uncovered a new mystery for Leigh and her hapless coven to sort out. Now, the upcoming Witches Halloween Gala is in jeopardy, not to mention the future of civilization. Follow these magical misfits, as they travel half way around the world to a hexed Scottish Castle and take on the very essence of evil, in Hopeful Leigh.",
