  "description": "What is utopia? Why are communes created? Where are they, and what do they promote? The Palgrave Companion to North American Utopias is a fascinating catalog of utopian societies and communes from past to present. From the Shakers to the Mormons to the Raelians and the Hutterites, the quest for a utopian lifestyle has been a human endeavor since the beginning of time. In this intriguing guide, North American utopian communities are explored by John and Virginia Friesen with a view to a new social system for the twenty-first century. The authors assert that the formation of a utopian society is feasible, and give examples of how to create one. This is a smart, clever, and unique reference for all who are curious to know more about utopian communities.",
