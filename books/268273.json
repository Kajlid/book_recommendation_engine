The fate of all paranormal beings hangs in the balance. Too bad Divina, the witch in question, wants nothing to do with any of it.  She’s not about to let some ancient prophecy dictate who she’s going to love. She’ll be the master of her own destiny, thank you very much. But the intense connection she feels to each of her sexy prophecy counterparts is making it difficult to avoid potential magical disaster. And as everything continues to get more and more complicated, she’s starting to wonder—is she really the witch of the prophecy?
