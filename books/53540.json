  "description": "Some things are too painful to remember--and too deadly to forget. One girl, age 13. Unconscious. Unharmed. Unclaimed. Unidentified. Everything.J.D. can't run from her past any longer. She knows the truth that she's dangerous, a weapon. If she can't learn to control her powers, there's no telling what...or who...she'll destroy next. To finally unlock the secrets in her mind, she will have to return to the Institute that created her. But going back won't be easy. Almost nobody goes in--and no one ever gets out.",
