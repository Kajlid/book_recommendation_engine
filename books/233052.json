Rainieri watches his wife from a distance, until he just cannot watch any longer. Through the salon window he sees someone else taking what is his, setting off his possessive streak. When she doesn’t get his subtle messages and her stubborn nature won’t give up, he steps in to take what was his all along. As twisted as the gossip you hear in the hair salon, Cut & Blow will have you blushing and begging to hear the rest of the story.",
