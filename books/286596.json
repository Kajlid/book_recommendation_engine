  "description": "SandraBefore THAT night, the over the top party and the cake incident, I spent Saturday nights with girlfriends, lamenting my life over margaritas.I wasn’t ready for Jacob Clark. He was sin and dark edges, wrapped in regret. He was my kryptonite. His words oozed over me like warm honey. His dark eyes pricked my soul, and his touch….those fingers set my skin on fire. Of course, he was too good to be true. And before I could wipe the icing off my greedy lips, I was walking away.So, why was he invading her dreams?JacobShe was the remedy to everything. Until my family, my past provoked me. I made one little scene, and Sandra walked away without a word, despite our mind-blowing connection. When I finally barged in on her life again, she told me she didn’t want me. I told her in her pretty face she did. She more than wanted me. Remember the ache? When I’m with her, it goes away. If she wants a chase, I’ll give her one. Who knows? When I catch her, I might never let go.",
