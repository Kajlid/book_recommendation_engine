  "description": "A \"Kill-or-Be-Killed\" Scenario! If you had to kill an infant of an alien species to save your own life... could you do it? What if the future of the entire human race depends on your decision? When space colonists from Earth crash-land on a planet orbiting the star Epsilon Eridani, they must wrestle with an ethical dilemma. They've emerged from their stasis pods 33 years older than when they started. They could harvest stem cells from alien infants to counteract the effects of human aging... but the process will kill the infants. As factions develop among the astronauts, the scientists race ahead with experiments to restore their youthful vigor-and must face the unexpected consequences of their choices. \"Entertaining and thought-provoking. Groundwater uses engaging characters to adeptly contrast the intellectual, biological, and emotional urges we have to protect our species.\" -Laura E. Reeve, author the Major Ariane Kedros Novels.",
