  "description": "He's a bastard and a gambler and society's favorite reprobate. But to Lady Kiri Lawford he's a hero - braver than the smugglers whom he rescues her from, more honorable than any lord she's ever met, and far more attractive than any man has a right to be. How can she not fall in love? But Damian Mackenzie has secrets that leave no room in his life for courting high-born young ladies - especially not the sister of one of his oldest friends. Yet when Kiri's quick thinking reveals a deadly threat to England's crown, Damian learns that she is nowhere near as prim and respectable as he first assumed...and the lady is far more alluring than any man can resist.",
