  "description": "First book of 108 contemporary poetry authored by Alice Shapiro is receiving rave reviews in the literary world.  Cracked was nominated for a GAYA Award (Georgia Author of the Year) and \"Usury\" from Cracked was nominated for a 2010 Pushcart Prize.Some review examples Cracked stings of the truthfulness or raw observation. Shapiro adventures through the glimpses of friends, strangers, nature, and the pain of those relationships.  --B. L. Pawelek.Alice Shapiro's poems in \"Cracked\" explore the complex relationships we have as humans to one another, and to the world. With strong images and gripping words, the poems in this book compel us to look at the ordinary and the extraordinary in our own lives. The eloquent use of metaphor in each poem leaves the reader wanting more, turning the page, to find wonderful creativity and surprises in language. The poetry in this collection, does indeed, bring the reader to examine the cracks of our inner and outer worlds. With precision and imagery, the poet finds the waiting spaces inside each of us.  --Connie Post Livermore Poet LaureateReminded me somewhat of Seamus Heaney... --Edward PellThere are one hundred nine poems in this volume and the book is a page turner.  I found myself gulping down the words in each of her poems.  I read through the volume so quickly, I had to slow myself down and go back and read again....  Cracked is not just an excellent read; it is an empowering, thoughtful and lyrical path of words leading us through a nuanced journey where the words direct light in just the right way. --Skye Leslie, The Smoking Poet",
