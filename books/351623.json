  "description": "Skye Garin treasures her work as a volunteer in the pediatric ward of the local hospital. Bringing even a small amount of joy to a suffering child—whether through her playful attitude or her gift for music—is a blessing that Skye cherishes. But due to overcrowding, her favorite young patient’s new roommate is an adult—a man who catches Skye completely off guard. Despite his gruff exterior, Skye is compelled to help the unnerving man. But the old scars of personal tragedy—and a fundamental difference of faith—might undermine Skye’s chances at a happy ending. Jordan Kiley can’t imagine anything more frustrating than his current situation. A car accident has left him confined to a hospital bed, his arm painfully pinned in traction. He can’t even feed himself. But when he first lays eyes on the beautiful volunteer, he knows there are far greater challenges awaiting him. Astutely, he senses that Skye’s sparkling wit hides a heart that has been unbearably broken. And Jordan has deep secrets of his own. Can he convince Skye that she is worthy of love—and then earn her heart in the process?",
