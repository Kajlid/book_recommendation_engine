  "description": "Erotic Contemporary, Older Woman/Younger ManForty-five-year-old Dana Markus knows a full moon makes people act crazy. It’s why they call the power company with stories about aliens disrupting the earth’s climate. It probably explains why her ex-husband left her for a girl scarcely older than their college-age daughter. It definitely accounts for why she impulsively invited the neighbor’s hunk of a son over for a skinny-dip. And why 28-year-old Lon Corbin accepted.Lon doesn’t think much of the mass of rock orbiting the earth, but he does think he’s the luckiest man alive when the sexy divorcee he’s admired from afar invites him into her pool. He knows she has reservations about their age difference, but he’s planning to show her in a very physical way how good they could be together if she’ll give him the chance.But when their simmering private passion boils over into a public relationship, family pressures and schemes threaten to split the couple apart.The moon brought them together -- but can it save them?Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find voyeurism.",
