  "title": "Five Wishes: How Answering One Simple Question Can Make Your Dreams Come True",
  "description": "An encounter at a party changed Gay Hendricks forever. A stranger asked him to imagine himself on his deathbed and to consider this question:“Was your life a complete success?” If not, then “What would be the things you’d wish had happened that would have made it a success?” Hendricks said his deepest wish was for a loving, lasting relationship with a woman. The stranger said, \"turn that wish into a goal, and put it in the present tense.” On the spot, Hendricks came up with this goal, \"I enjoy a happy marriage with a woman I adore and who adores me. I enjoy a lifelong blossoming of passion and creativity with her.\" This goal helped him create his marriage to Kathlyn, the date he'd taken to the party, and during the past 27 years they've become well-known relationship experts and co-authors of 9 books together. This short, focused book shows readers how to discover their own five wishes for a fulfilled life (as well as to read the stories of all five of Hendricks's wishes). Neale Donald Walsch's thoughtful foreword explores the power of this approach and explains why he insisted Hendricks share it with others.",
