But her burdens feel lighter when she meets rural lawyer Mackenzie Knightley. Their attraction is powerful and unexpected. Life is perfect… until Sid learns that Mack hasn't been completely honest about his job. When problems arise with Luis' foster care situation, she must decide: can she trust Mack again, when she has so much more to lose?",
