  "description": "Whenever things get rough, Roxanne escapes to other worlds. She has a talent that skips generations, a talent that no one else believes exists. Except her granddaughter Marissa, who exhibits the same talent. Marissa, who can open windows to other worlds with the movement of a finger. Roxanne wants to train Marissa to live with her talent, but the rest of the family wants to stop her. They’re afraid Marissa will end up like Roxanne, difficult, unreachable, distant. They’re afraid Marissa will not survive Roxanne’s training—or her love.",
