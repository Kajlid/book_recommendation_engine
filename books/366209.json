  "description": "Addicted Lisa Renee Jones Samantha is getting married to a man most consider a real catch-rich and handsome. But with the big day approaching, she feels uncertain, because deep in her heart there is one man who still calls to her-Eric. Young and foolish, Eric had walked away from the woman he loved. But when he learns Samantha is getting married, he knows he has to act-no matter how down and dirty he has to get. When Eric shows up at Samantha's bachlorette party, she figures one last romp between the sheets with him might be just what the doctor ordered. It will prove Eric isn't the hot a lover or 'love' her mind and heart have conjured up all these years. But soon passion burns like never before, and Samantha might just have an addiction she can never beat.Eric.",
