  "description": "True Ghost Stories of Borneo is a collection of short ghost stories, written by Dr Aammton Alias. The author is a family physician working in Borneo and this book contains more than 30 supernatural ghost encounters. These are not stories with 'happily ever after' endings. Most were accounts and recalls from family, friends and my former patients. A number of stories may have been left open ended with no explanation, as had been shared in that manner.",
