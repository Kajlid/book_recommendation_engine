  "description": "Wanting desperately to write a novel, author Sondra Harris began keeping an online journal to hone her writing skills and attempt to come up with a decent idea that would lend itself well to long fiction. Five years later, she found herself no closer to having a novel-length, publishable work; however, her efforts have produced a hearty collection of scattered ideas, observations, and short narratives, plus one or two short fiction pieces.",
