They had fun! They didn’t have responsibilities! And then they decided to have a baby. Goodbye lazy weekends, hello sleepless nights, arguments and an addiction to industrial-strength hot chocolate.In the midst of this major life change, Suzy discovered that most parenting advice should be taken with a pinch of salt—or ten.For example:#1 Lie—Just go with your mother’s instinct. But what if your instinct is telling you to hide under the stairs?#10 Lie—Your new baby will tell you what it needs. Not if it can’t talk it won’t.#23 Lie—You should never bribe your children. You will ALWAYS bribe your children.Follow Suzy on the ultimate make-over—from nervous-wreck new mother to happy families. In this hilarious and refreshingly honest account for parents who prefer the realistic to the utopian, Suzy debunks the myths and takes us all along for the (bumpy) ride.",
