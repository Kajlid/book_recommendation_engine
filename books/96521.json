  "description": "This great Persian classic collection of sayings, stories and poems is considered to be so important that children are taught ethics and behavior with it in schools. They are so simple, funny and accessible to all that there is hardly a Farsi-speaker alive that does not know some of them by heart. Sayed Omar Ali-Shah's translation, hitherto only available in French, was the first to reveal the sufic dimension of this masterpiece, but children have instinctively recognized its inner truth since time",
