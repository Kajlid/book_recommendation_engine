  "title": "Rabbit Trail: How a Former Playboy Bunny Found Her Way",
  "description": "It's the 1950's, and Irish Catholic Tricia Williams is surviving childhood in Brooklyn, New York, watching Leave It to Beaver and hanging out at Gino's Pizzeria. Though the family scene is short on security, she's got friends and faith. Twenty years later, the surging sexual revolution is in full swing, and her obsession is \"breaking away.\" She's abandoned the Church, and now in a hurry to leave home, makes a daring move to Los Angeles. It's a strange city, and Tricia soon realizes it might not be the start of something big, but bad. It's not the obsessive apartment-hopping or even her unique job-a-month plan that's the problem. What she's really looking for are spiritual roots, and she's about to get entwined in a weird web of Buddhism, Mormonism, Hinduism, and New Age practices that will keep her wandering a Rabbit Trail for decades, until one charismatic man unlocks the secret for her.",
