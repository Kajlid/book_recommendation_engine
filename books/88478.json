Their encounter begins when Thomas Klence bends over to pick up a quarter, and Eli Golden crashes into him with his expensive bike, sending both of their lives spiraling in ways they would have never imagined. Doomed to spend detention together, they quickly discover that they are complete opposites. Thomas resents Eliâ€™s haughty and elitist attitude, while Eli views Thomas as nothing more than a lowly pest. But they slowly discover that they might not be so different as they had thought. They both hide their own secrets and tell their own lies, but will they be able to reveal the truth? It starts with a bent spoon, a bicycle crash, and two boys who seek to reveal their true selves.",
