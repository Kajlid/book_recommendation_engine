  "description": "Can a Republican strategist and a Democratic news producer look beyond their differences on election night? Owen Horn, former Democratic strategist, is more than a little invested in the current presidential election. But on the night of the election, he has other things on his mind. On the surface, Sam Delgado, key Republican strategist, is everything that Owen detests. He's on the wrong side of the conservative spectrum. He takes his marching orders from a man Owen disagrees with on every single policy. But Sam is friendly, smart, and gorgeous. Owen has a tendency to forget their enemies. While the country holds its collective breath waiting for the presidential election results, Owen holds his own election. Genres: Gay / Contemporary",
