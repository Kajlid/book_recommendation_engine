Timberwolf was captured by the Arnock and can now \"hear\" the Arnock in his head. Near madness, he's gone on multiple suicide missions and come back unscathed - the alien forcing him to survive. Emanuel Gray was Timberwolf's commander and mentor. A former General, now religious fanatic - Gray sees our peace with the Arnock as a sin. He's a wanted man and hell-bent on wiping the Arnock out. Timberwolf chases Gray to the weapons factory world of Highland. When the Arnock arrive it becomes a battle for the deadliest weapons in the galaxy.
