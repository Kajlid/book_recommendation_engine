  "title": "The Norseman",
  "description": "The Norseman is the first volume of the vividly-detailed historical chronicles of Halldorr, an orphan whose entire desire was to lay beside both a warm hearth and a plump wife, but fate had another thread to spin. Instead, he found himself exiled, resigned to a life of raiding, killing for plunder and survival. He became bodyguard to a king, brutally fighting in monumental battles - Maldon and Swoldr - to be handed down for centuries in skaldic verse.Because of a blood-oath made years before the murder of his father, Halldorr was adopted by an exile, Greenlandâ€™s discoverer, Erik the Red. Halldorr believes his life is his to command when Freydis, the fierce, fire-haired enchantress, at last desires to be his wife. However, destiny strikes, forcing him to flee from Greenland to Ireland to England to Norway without her. He fights his way to wealth and in an epic battle, defending his king against overwhelming odds, he finds that it was not destiny, but betrayal that sent him into banishment thirteen years earlier.",
