But his world is blown apart in the space of minutes one night, when he is the victim of an horrific attack in a public toilet.When Jip comes out of a coma, he has lost his memory. With a shattered brain and shattered body, he is unable to remember anything of the attack, unable to remember his life before the attack - he cannot even recognise his own family. To encourage him to rebuild his body, his mother takes him to the local gym where he meets Kasper; beautiful, androgynous Kasper, who takes Jip under his wing and endeavours to help him recover his strength.Yet with his attacker still on the loose, Jip's life is in constant danger. And with a memory that can be so effortlessly manipulated, the lines between fact and fiction, friend and enemy, can be all too easily effaced.",
