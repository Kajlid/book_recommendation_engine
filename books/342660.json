  "title": "Dysaffirmations: Because This Kind Of Stupid Takes Work!",
  "description": "A dysaffirmation is a dysfunctional affirmation. As you know, an affirmation is a phrase, statement or suggestion that is repeated with the intention of making it a reality. There are individuals in this world committed to living miserable lives. In fact most people have areas of their lives that just don't seem to work. We create beliefs about ourselves and the world and these beliefs become negative affirmations, or dysaffirmations. We then rewire our brains and are convinced this is the only way of doing things. We are doomed! We at CoupleDumb are committed to healthy relationships. The dysaffirmations are funny ways to show that some people really believe these things. These are what Victor Frankl talked about as paradoxical intentions. He posited that if we become aware of our dysfunction, we can fix it, especially, when we come face to face with the absurdity of our own beliefs.",
