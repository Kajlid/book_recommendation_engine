Lia has become the public face of the mechs and BioMax’s poster girl for the up-and-coming technology, devoting her life to convincing the world that she—and the others like her—deserve to exist. But then Jude resurfaces, bringing scandalous information that suggests BioMax is using the technology for a great evil. And when Lia learns a shocking truth about the accident that resulted in her download, she is forced to make a decision she can never reverse.",
