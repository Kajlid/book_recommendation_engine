  "description": "True crime writer Elle Bramasol is drawn into a macabre mystery when incarcerated Hollywood producer Eliot Kingman asks her to write a book about his case. As she delves deeper into Kingman's murder conviction, she discovers that he possesses a centuries old diary written by an elusive vampire named Verland. Uncovering the transformative secrets held within the diary's pages, Elle is drawn deeper into both Kingman's deadly schemes and Verland's dark world of shadows. When the two finally collide, the stage is set for a climactic battle over mankind's ultimate prize: eternal triumph over death. But will the Holy Grail of immortality turn out to be the cruelest curse of all? Exploring the allure of the shadowy places between life and death, between fantasy and reality, and the ultimate power of belief, Verland: The Transformation is a gothic-inspired tour de force, a brooding return to the roots of the vampire genre that goes for the throat from page one until the final, bone-chilling climax.",
