  "description": "The hit poetry collection from the creative force behind The Smashing PumpkinsHaving risen to fame during the grunge era in the early nineties, Billy Corgan is among the most respected figures of the alternative rock worldâ€•a visionary artist who, more than a decade later, still commands a devoted following. Long admired for his evocative songwriting, Corgan embarks on a deeper exploration of literary terrain as a poet. Full of \"the regretful melancholy of his music [and] the rhythmic, angular wordplay of his best Pumpkins lyrics\" (Jeff Vrabel, Chicago Sun-Times), the poems in this collection form an imagistic journey through the intensely personal as Corgan throws into sharp relief issues of love, loss, identity, and loyalty. Crafted with a thoughtful and cadenced approach that shares the same allegiance to thunder and quiet found in his music, these writings further solidify Corgan's place as the voice of a generation.",
