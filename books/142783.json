But woo her he cannot—not with a fatal disease that saps more of his strength every day.Faith would slay dragons to keep her brother safe from her father’s scheme to set his simpleminded heir aside. But it’s Gerard, who feels the hot breath of death down his neck, who wins her heart.Then it is revealed that Gerard is none other than the reincarnation of Zeus, and they face a far more dangerous enemy—Kronos, whose plan to regain power includes Gerard’s death. To foil his plan, Gerard and Faith must hold firm to the power of love…and defy Fate itself.Warning: Be careful—beautiful clothes, perfect manners and heat between the sheets are bound to keep you awake at night!",
