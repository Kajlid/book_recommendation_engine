  "title": "The Nemesis Chronicles",
  "description": "The Nemesis Chronicles is the combination of Nemesis Blood Trails and Dark Apprentice. The first two novels of the apocalyptic five book series which outlines the incessant struggle between the forces of good and evil; where fallen angels who were defeated in a battle waged in Heaven were exiled to the mortal plane. In book II Dark Apprentice the story begins right at the edge of the climatic and nail biting cliffhanger of the first novel, where a dark natured, Avenging Angel named Mathias successfully abducts the Child of Prophesy (Jessica Graham) who unknowingly is a descendent of the lost Davidic blood line, and is needed to aid him in initiating a chain of events that will set the foundations to Armageddon. Although Jessica s fate seems to be mired with evil intentions, all hope for redemption is not entirely lost. Close on their trail is the Arch Angel Raziel, who seeks to thwart Mathias sinister plans and end their four thousand year vendetta once and for all.",
