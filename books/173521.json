Everything from what she wears to who she dates is determined by what is deemed appropriate for their social standing.  Look a little closer.  Juliette isn’t cut out for that life. She lives for moments of reckless abandon to escape the crushing pressure of never being good enough.  Leo Ashlar appears to live his life entirely on his own terms. He’s a bartending bachelor and undefeated fight club champion.  Look a little closer.  He’s haunted by a tragic past and hides his demons even from those he loves.  When Juliette’s duplicit worlds collide with the handsome and untouchable Leo, both are impacted in ways they couldn’t foresee. Juliette’s life begins to unravel. Can Leo help her build a new one, or will his past be their ultimate demise?",
