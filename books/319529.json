  "description": "Major Vince \"Vapor\" DeLuca may have just accepted his most difficult recon mission ever-keeping an eye on Shay Bassett. As a pilot in the Air Force's top-secret test unit, Vince keeps a cool head at the controls. But ever since they were teens, Shay's had a way of jamming his radar. Now she's scheduled to tell Congress about Cleveland's escalating gang activity, and someone out there is trying to cut her testimony short. Living to tell the tale may depend on trusting the one man who burned her so badly years ago-and still makes her feel warm all over.",
