  "title": "Legend Unborn",
  "description": "Trapped for eons, a living legend has coerced and manipulated life in a desperate bid to break out of its unjust imprisonment. But the hope of attaining this goal falls into the incapable hands of Silvanus, a newly created god with a broken leg, Taff, a powerful young wizard who is yet to cast a successful spell, and Flyfar, a young eagle afraid of heights. And to think, heroes were once the kind you could actually rely on.Drawn to the power of the legend, the powerful sorcerer, Dargalore, returns after centuries of self-exile to claim what he believes is rightly his. Allied with dark gods that corrupt the souls of the innocent, the world waits with trepidation as the makings of a terrible war unfold that threaten to devour all.Legend Unborn is the first in The Key of Souls series and tells of the great quests undertaken by Silvanus, Taff and Flyfar as they struggle in a world where friendships are scarce, but suffering is plenty amongst the fear of the growing, cold darkness.",
