  "description": "Elizabeth Donald's The Cold Ones stands out from the crowd. Zombie stories are easy. Good zombie stories are more challenging and great ones, well, those are damned hard to find. The good news is you don't have to look any further than The Cold Ones to find one of the greats. A damned fine read and highly recommended. -- James A. Moore, author of Deeper and Blood Red",
