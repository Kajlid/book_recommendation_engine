  "description": "The penultimate volume in the New York Times bestselling Courtney Crumrin series is now available in paperback! Courtney Crumrin has never shied away from making sure justice is served, but now it will cost her dearly. On the run from the Coven with her former teacher Calpurnia, Courtney quickly learns just how sinister the witches and warlocks of Hillsborough can be—but she never thought she'd see the day when Uncle Aloysius turned on her as well. And it's much harder to fight a battle when the only family you care about stands against you. Courtney's only salvation lies in the Twilight Kingdom, where witches and wizards dare not enter. But Aloysius is no ordinary wizard, and he won't give up on his niece so easily... even if it means going to war with the night creatures.",
