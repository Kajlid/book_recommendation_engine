  "description": "The gods promised Saevel Balnorin that Nightbeasts were extinct. But when their brother is attacked by one of the vicious shadow creatures, Saevel vows to destroy the monsters for good — even if it means dabbling in the very same magic that creates them. The only person willing to point Saevel toward the answers they need is their trusted mentor, who provides them with a powerful spell that could be the key to eliminate Nightbeasts — if Saevel can translate the strange, ancient script.In the midst of this discovery, Saevel’s hometown is caught in the crossfire between two warring kingdoms, shattering the peace between forest-dwelling Elshalans and their human neighbors. Saevel is positive it’s all connected, especially when their mentor disappears and leaves behind a shocking letter from the warmongering human queen. Determined to uncover what’s really going on, Saevel sets out for the royal city, where they become irrevocably wrapped up in a web of secrets, dangerous magical experiments, and one god’s unflinching belief that Saevel will be the one to stop the war.Saevel never intended to be any kind of hero, but as the line between ally and enemy vanishes, they must decide where their own loyalties lie — with the gods who have failed them, or with their enemies, who actually have a plan to end the war, stop the queen, and hold further ruination at bay.",
