  "description": "A visit to Heddlestone, a remote village in the Yorkshire moors, changes librarian Kate Carter's life forever. The place has an eerie yet erotic charge; and when Kate is later offered a job in its puppet museum, she leaves London and her boyfriend to take up the post. Jake, the strange and beautiful curator and puppeteer, draws her into his secluded sensual world, and before long she is sharing his bed and discovering a new and frightening side of love and lust. But Heddlestone is a village with secrets, and Kate is haunted by a surreal holiday memory of a cool, handsome man dominating a woman dressed like a crazy ballerina. The man is Eddie, Jake's brother; and when Kate is seduced by him and his reckless Ukrainian wife, she becomes involved in a second dark relationship. Split between the two men, Kate moves closer to the truth of Heddlestone, sensing danger but not knowing if the greatest threat comes from ghosts or reality.",
