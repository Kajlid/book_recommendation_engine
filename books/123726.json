  "description": "Augustus Walker, Jr. is a problem. Every queer person I know has had a tragic crush on a straight person at some point in their lives, and for the last year, Walker has been mine.Not that my crush on him is serious—I'm just appreciating a sweet, sexy guy who happens to be a big fat goose egg on the Kinsey scale. Le sigh and all that.The Lost Boys—my queer friends from high school—insist, however, that he gets flustered every time we're in the same room together. Last night, he blushed when I teased him about his perfect abs.I'm afraid to push because I respect his sexuality, and I see how his family feels about him having a bunch of gay friends.Still, I gotta wonder… am I the only one with a crush?",
