When she travels back to North Carolina to see her parents, she and her ex have a one-night stand. She knows they are through, but sometimes what happens in the bedroom doesn’t always stay in the bedroom. Eight weeks later Isabella finds out she’s pregnant. She can’t tell anyone, because she knows how upset they’ll be. While struggling with decisions, Isabella catches the attention of the mysterious Rusty Tillman, a ranch hand for the Mitchell family. He’s handsome, hardworking, and ten years older. When Isabella refuses him, he takes it upon himself to claim the child as his own. Since she doesn’t want the family knowing the real father she goes along with the lie. The only problem is that Rusty wants more. Can Isabella open her heart to a new love, or will she go back to the only man she’s ever loved?",
