  "description": "When the Oceanic sets sail from England's Port of Southampton, its ultimate destination is New York. But it must make one very important stop at Cherbourg, in France, to pick up internationally renowned financier and art collector J. P. Morgan, fresh from a continental buying spree sure to have turned up numerous priceless objets d'art.Needless to say, George Porter Dillman and Genevieve Masefield, ship's detectives aboard the Oceanic, are slightly nervous about the presence of such an important passenger, not to mention his valuable cargo, among the passengers. For in their five years as detectives aboard the most elegant, regal sailing ships of their time, the two sleuths have never known a transatlantic voyage to pass without incident.Also on board are a recently engaged couple, a charming rake who seems set on breaking them apart as well as seducing Genevieve, a controversial painter of nudes traveling with his bohemian wife and his alluring French model, and a pair of cabin stewards who have exclusive access to the private lairs of all aboard.The latest shipboard tale from master of mystery Conrad Allen is certain to sail right into the hearts of the many fans of this delightful series.",
