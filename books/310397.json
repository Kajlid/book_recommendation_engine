  "title": "Tempting Him",
  "description": "When my dad called to lecture me about how it’s time to settle down, quit partying, and get a job that will actually prepare me for life after college, I agreed. Mostly.After spring break, I’ll buckle down and be ready to work, but until then, I’m getting my fill of fun. Which is why when I spot an attractive man sitting alone at a bar, I approach him with the hopes of being able to tempt him into a night full of pleasure. After all, being with an older guy is just about the only thing I haven’t done.When I wake up in his bed with a note that makes it clear he doesn’t intend on seeing me again, I take it in stride. But when I show up to the job my dad set up for me, it turns out my new boss, Alexander Gates, is the guy who thought he’d be done with me after a one-night stand. On top of that, apparently he’s a friend of my dad’s, and the head of the company.I tried moving on from our night together, but working with him day after day is just too tempting to not have a taste again.",
