  "description": "*The author is listed as Ben Graham at Amazon, but shows under Ben Zackheim's profile. Ben Graham doesn't have one.Shirley Link is a 14-year old detective, but she doesn't want anyone to know about her sleuthing skills. Whenever she uses her powers of observation she gets into trouble.An example? She wrote a school paper about a tough case she'd solved over summer vacation.“It’s not a creative writing assignment, Shirley,\" the teacher scolded. \"You were supposed to write about what actually happened.”“I did,” she said, louder than she meant to. But he gave her a D anyway.So when the school principal needs Shirley's help to catch a thief she tries to do it quietly. Can she track down a criminal who's clever enough to steal $35,000 and the one-ton safe it was kept in? Can she do it without the whole world finding out about her detective skills?Hint: the answer to one of those questions is, no.A great read for kids (and their adults).",
