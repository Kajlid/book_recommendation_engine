  "title": "Holiday Specials on Television, 1939-2021",
  "description": "In November 1939, NBC's fledgling television station W2XBS broadcast the first known holiday special, The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade . Despite its small viewership (very few TV sets existed at the time), the experimental telecast was a harbinger of a now-beloved American the holiday television special. This book offers a thorough account of holiday television specials in the United States from 1939 to 2021, highlighting variety shows, comedic performances, musical spectaculars and more. From familiar favorites (1964's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer ) to campy one-offs (1985's He-Man and A Christmas Special ), the 1140 programs are covered alphabetically and feature performance casts, production credits and storylines for each. Three appendices cover \"lost\" holiday specials, along with Christmas and Halloween-themed episodes of popular television series.",
