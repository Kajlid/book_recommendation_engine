But this summer camping trip reveals their true power the horses and their young riders must travel centuries into the past to save the village of their ancestors. Uncovering amazing abilities, girls and horses work together to challenge a ruthless enemy, rescue a young princess, and realize their destinies include a prophecy only they can fulfill. Will the girls develop the trust and friendship necessary to battle together? Are the horses going to survive a battle plan sure to end in disaster? Can the young princess be saved before the evil chieftain destroys her? Can true love cross the distance of seven hundred years? Their very lives will depend on the magic only the Ice Horses can provide, and the courage hidden within their hearts.",
