  "description": "An alternative cover for this ISBN can be found here.\"Although a year and a half of living with Aunt Patsy had made me far less a creature of habit than I had been originally, I had known immediately that island life was not going to be idyllic...\"Emma's brief experience of Aunt Patsy's eccentricities was sufficient to convince her of some--but not all--of the complications which life on a remote Scottish island would be sure to entail. Despite her initial forebodings, however, she is surprised to find herself enjoying life on Stranday more than in \"civilization.\"When Aunt Patsy's baby is born, however, all of Emma's practical and managing instincts take over, and only the good sense and affectionate bullying of her brother, Richard, visiting from the mainland, pull her out of her domestic doldrums. With aunt Patsy, her baby, and her husband well settled and with their gallery off to a good start, Emma's own role in this family becomes increasingly burdensome. Still, she is not convinced that continuing her schooling on the mainland is the answer. An exciting trip on the continent and a romance with a young archaeologist make her decision easier.In Emma's Island Honor Arundel again demonstrates the skillful blend of sympathy and humour which has established her as a most successful writer for teen-agers.",
