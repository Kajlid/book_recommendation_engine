  "description": "He was my best friend.The fiercely protective boy who always caught me when I fell.Until I moved away.Now, ten years later, Logan Miller is a gorgeous, Grammy-winning DJ and a dedicated single dad—and hotter than any hit on the Billboards!When our paths cross again, fantasies of him turn into reality.I moved back to Austin to build a life outside the safety net of my wonderful, albeit overbearing, Indian family. Preferring the company of my old dog, my online games, and reruns of Marvel movies, I’m nowhere close to the type of woman who can handle a public life. The type of woman who’d be best suited for Logan Miller.But when neither of us can control the gravitational pull of the other, we give in.In limos, on mountains, on rooftops, in airplanes…We create the perfect remix of a song written just for us.But just when the beat of our hearts seem perfectly matched, perfectly in sync, his past threatens to shake the foundation he’s built so carefully. The only thing we can do is rely on the one thing that’s bonded us together—our love.But will that be enough?",
