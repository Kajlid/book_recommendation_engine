  "description": "FATAL ATTRACTIONCountry singer Sam Patton had come to Serenity Island to get away from a crazed fan. The disturbed woman had already seriously injured one person, and she'd violated his home. It was probably just a matter of time until she tracked him down again--she wasn't going to stop until he was dead.The last thing he should have been thinking about was another woman. But beautiful, vulnerable Leigh Buchanan was the kind of woman fantasies were made of, and he knew he wouldn't be able to leave her behind.But Leigh had a reason of her own for hiding out on this island. How could Sam ask her to leave the safety she'd found here and go with him, knowing her life would be in danger, too?",
