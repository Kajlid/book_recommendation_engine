  "description": "Spreyton is a village in Devon that is haunted by many ghosts, but none is more fascinating than the spectrum, a female poltergeist who threw people about rather than furniture. One day in 1682, she began a series of spiteful attacks on Philip Conybeare, a gardener at the rectory.Alan, a young thatcher who is helping his father to thatch the roof of the rectory, finds a ring buried deep in the reed near the chimney. The ring has the power to transport him into the past, and he and the rector's daughter, Kate, find themselves back in the seventeenth century, living out the lives of Philip Conybeare and his wife, Jane.Unfortunately, the removal of the ring releases the power of the spectrum into the present, and she starts on another course of malicious destruction, terrorising Alan and some of the inhabitants of the village.It needs not only all the intelligence, trust and growing affection of Kate and Alan to outwit the spectrum, but assistance, at the moment they most need help, from the most unexpected quarter.",
