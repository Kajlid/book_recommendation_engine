  "description": "A prequel novella offering a deeper look at the world of the Baine Chronicles.\n  Life as a shifter-mage hybrid has always been tough for Sunaya Baine. Ostracized from her clan and forced to hide her forbidden abilities, she’s never fit in. So when she’s offered a position at the Enforcers Guild, Solantha’s crime-fighting organization, she jumps at the chance to prove her worth.  But when Sunaya swaggers onto her first day at the job, the last thing she expects it to be partnered up with a spoiled rich girl. Annia is a Lone Wolf enforcer--one who doesn’t play well with others. The two of them will have to play ball though, because a little girl has gone missing, and if they don’t find her soon, she might just fall prey to Solantha’s dark underbelly of magic and crime.",
