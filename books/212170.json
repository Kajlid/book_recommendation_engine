  "description": "The bluest of blood; the noblest of hearts; the de Montforte brothers will take your breath away.Meet Lord Charles...\"On the eve of battle, I find my heart is restless and uneasy. And when a fellow is three thousand miles from home, love makes a far more desirable companion than loneliness.\" —Lord Charles de Montforte, Boston, Massachusetts, 1775Wounded in battle, Englishman Charles de Montforte has awakened to find himself in the tender care of a sensuous, sloe-eyed local miss, whose beauty would be a joy he would treasure always...if only their paths had crossed in some other place and time. Charles' heart is profoundly moved by Amy Leighton's desperate plight, and her curvaceous dark loveliness and gentle, healing touch are enflaming his desire. But the noble British lord is already taken, though Amy soon lures him away from past loyalties to Crown and fiancée with a golden, rapturous promise of love happily forever after. Amy has long prayed for someone special to enter her life—someone who would take her far away from the daily drudgery imposed upon her by a cruel, unloving step-family. Now fate has brought her the strong yet gentle man of her dreams; but the handsome stranger is from an enemy land...and he's sworn to love another.",
