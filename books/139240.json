  "description": "Viola has always felt like she doesn’t belong. With her mother halfway around the world, her sister away at school, and her father as her only friend, she keeps to herself and only dreams of becoming an artist. The last thing a teenager wants for her birthday is to spend time with an old woman she doesn’t even know. And she certainly doesn’t want to travel 544 years back in time to Renaissance Florence.  Armed with Idan, a mysterious pocket watch, she must navigate the perilous city before she falls victim to the threats of Lorenzo the Magnificent. For a girl that has a hard time meeting people, Viola manages to befriend the famous artist Leonardo da Vinci and gain the affections of the handsome Giuliano de' Medici. Only by working in a master artist's workshop will Viola discover her voice, tap into her artistic abilities, and find her way home.",
