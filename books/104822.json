  "description": "\"I poked the rancid beef about my plate, suppressing a desire to run from this place, dancing and singing, all the way to the Mermaid, for that afternoon I made a momentous decision, the most important decision a man makes, for I decided what to do with the rest of my life. I was going to become an apothecary. I wanted to celebrate, tell the whole world, and drink a toast to myself. Instead I withered beneath the stony glare of Mrs Collis, who stared like she suspected me of a great crime, her face glowing a shade of pale green in the candlelight.\"Harry thought that the Plague was all over. Until Lord Arlington ordered him to travel to Shyam to find a traitor and bring him back to London. Shyam is a small village that still harbours the plague. The village's inhabitants have barricaded their borders so that no one who enters the village is allowed to leave until the Plague has gone. To enter Shyam is likely to die, but Harry has no choice.The first two installments in this historical crime series were previously published by Beautiful Books but now reissued by A&B.",
