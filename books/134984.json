  "description": "With the death of the former goddess of wisdom and acceptance, another has been chosen to step up and take the name Wisdom, along with the responsibilities that come with that title. It's every minor goddess' dream. But on her first day in the inner sanctum of the major gods, Wisdom has a very unpleasant run in with \"The Beast\" also referred to as Death , the god of death and the underworld who also happens to be the crankiest, most self-important god in the clouds. And the brother of Time, the leader over all the gods. Though not completely happy with the way he treats people, she is drawn immediately to his terrifying beauty and demanding presence.Death is furious that the beauty he is saddled with talks to him the way nobody had dared since the day he was cursed by a witch over 100 years ago. He's even less happy when she tries to teach him manners. But when living souls start popping up in the underworld, he'll need her help to not only fix the portals leading to the In-Between, but also to fix him and break the curse.",
