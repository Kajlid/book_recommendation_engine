Since 1923, when the newly formed company broadcast its first full-length play, generations of actors and producers have honed and perfected the craft of making Shakespeare to be heard. Titles include Othello, Hamlet, King Lear, and Macbeth. Revitalized, original, and comprehensive, this is Shakespeare for the new millennium.",
