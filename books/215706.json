  "description": "Diego didn’t think he’d survive his master’s brutal treatment for long. But when the man suddenly dies, his heir gives the slave boy renewed hope. His new master is everything Diego ever yearned for—handsome as sin, sexy and best of all, kind. Suddenly, being a trained pleasure slave turns from being a nightmare to a dream come true. Jason McGill has lived a carefree and optimistic life with the one ambition of creating his art. He certainly never expected to inherit his uncle’s newly-acquired wealth, including a house full of slaves. The pretty boy who is there to warm his bed, however, is easy to accept. He never expected to own a slave, but he cannot resist the lure of the hauntingly beautiful slave boy with the deeply sad eyes. Jason makes it his mission to chase that look away and replace it with a happy one. Their tentative relationship is put to the test when Jason’s free boyfriend, Kurt, arrives. Jason thinks the three of them can form a loving bond, but Kurt has other plans. To him, Diego is just a living toy, something to play with however he wants. To stay with Jason, Diego will endure anything. As tensions mount, he can only hope Jason will take off his rose-colored glasses and see the world as it really is.",
