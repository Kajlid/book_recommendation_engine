  "description": "\"Set in the fantastic world of Waerdal, The Grey Heir is a boy-based, young adult, hero’s journey that follows a young merchant’s son, Rayne Drehmer (later Rayne Arcesk), as he’s co-opted into a centuries old conflict between aristocratic mages and the Order of Trel.Used as a pawn by one side and then forcefully conscripted by the other, Rayne must untangle twisted histories to discover where his loyalties should lie in a world where both sides seem at least partially justified. Should he fight for those who seem to be the best caretakers of the world, or those who promote its freedom?\"",
