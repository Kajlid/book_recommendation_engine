  "description": "I only want to stay in.In my pajamas.Inside.In. In. In.For a boy and his toy giraffe, today is the perfect day to stay in. Snug in his pajamas, he reads books, bakes popovers, and plays with a big wicker basket—that he transforms into a rocket ship to fly in “innerspace.” But soon, the outdoors is too tempting to resist, and he takes his wild imagination intonature. That is, until it’s time to come inside again.Illustrated with the gorgeous paper cuts for which Nikki McClure is known, In reminds us of the essential childhood pleasures found in an engaged day of imaginative play and exploration, without electronics, scheduled activities, or adults.",
