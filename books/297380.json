  "description": "Elsie Taylor is smart, sexy, and well connected to life she has with her friends and family. She also happens to be obsessed with vampire romance fiction. It's part of why, at twenty-eight years old, she hasn't settled down- she always craves something more from life. But when she meets Cy, who is new to town, her desire for excitement and danger falls by the wayside in favor of a life with the sweet, respectful man she's fallen for. If only she understood what it meant to be careful what you wish for, because Cy's very presence in her life will change it in terrifying and painful ways.Conversely, Opal is as disconnected as someone can be. The strongest vampire to be made in centuries, she immediately upon her rebirth joins the ruling class. She is a true succubus, seducing and killing with abandon. Her desire for others to fear her, rather than love her, allows her to maintain the lofty isolation she craves. The only person she cares about is her friend and sire, the thousand-year-old vampire with a chip on her shoulder, Amber, whom she hasn't heard from in years.What neither of them know is that Amber has a plan, one she's been waiting a long time to act upon. It will connect Elsie and Opal in ways they would never expect, and force them to confront their strengths and their failings. Stopping Amber, if they even choose to, won't be easy, and could lead either or both of them into greatness....Or madness...",
