He makes a little 'come on' gesture at me and then leans forward and grabs my lips with his.I don't stop playing; I can't.

Hot wet heat takes over my mouth and pulls the rest of the inner me out, and then I'm kissing Turner back hard and fast and furious while the world's most intense riffs are just pulled straight through me, cutting me up and bleeding me over the stage.",
