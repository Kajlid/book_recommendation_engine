Unfortunately for him, his abductors returned him to an era far before his own lifetime. Fortunately, however for his people, Elix offers a plethora of knowledge about the future invaders and their technologies. He offers a fighting chance for his people.Centuries later, they develop a covert way to visit the world they call Violation - a world we know as Earth. They now have a supreme technology that can permit them to insert three individual minds (an elected committee to determine the fate of their enemies) into a single robotic unit disguised in human form.
