That’s what Alex learns after she starts playing bass for a rock band in this almost true story. Joyce Raskin, author and musician, culls from her memories to create this funny, touching, and honest look at what it’s like to be a teenager, a girl, and a rock star all at the same time. Also included are a note from the author, instructions on how to play basic guitar chords, advice on songwriting, and more!",
