  "description": "No Need for a Ladder contains 25 haiku inspired by Monterey Bay, California, a place where seals, sea lions, sea gulls and fishermen share the coastline. Penetrating and curious, this collection of poetry of place focuses on that which is easily neglected, left unobserved. In particular, it examines how various cultural, spiritual and ecological relationships intertwine and unwind in specific moments in time, leaving the world wholly unchanged yet completely different from what it once was.mid-March:sea lions exchange glanceson the porch of a houseboatdrifting snowflakes ...the space between what once wasand what is yet to befishing boat pulls in--three pelicans waitwith their mouths open",
