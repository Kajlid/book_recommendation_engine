  "description": "Sometimes just accepting an invitation can be an act of bravery. Have you ever been to a sex party? It will change your life! Leena's traditional South Asian mother is constantly nagging her to lose weight and get pregnant, her husband of five years feels more like a roommate than a lover and she has the sinking feeling she's never had an orgasm. But other than that, life is fine. That is until she attends a sex party and is inspired by what she learns. Leena feels empowered, which sets in motion her journey of self-discovery and personal transformation - everything from using a vibrator for the first time to wearing a g-string and a provocative incident with a samosa that has even her husband rethinking oral sex! In trying to discover who she truly is, will Leena suffer the backlash of her community, and worse her own mother?",
