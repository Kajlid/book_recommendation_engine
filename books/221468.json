  "description": "\"Ride shotgun with a \"James Bond-of-the-supernatural\"* as the Secret Histories Novels take you careering through an alternate London where around every corner a new kind of danger awaits.... My name is Eddie Drood, aka Shaman Bond, the very secret agent. And I am a dead man walking. I've been poisoned by Dr. DOA. There is no cure, no treatment, no chance of a last-minute miracle. So all that is left to me and my love, Molly Metcalf, is to track down my killer and stop him before he can murder anyone else. So whether that means fighting a secret army on another world; or searching for a forgotten weapon in the Museum of Unattached Oddities; or facing off against Grendel Rex, the Unforgiven God, in the hidden heart of the Moon, for the terrible secret that is Moonbreaker...I will do whatever it takes, while I still can. Because the game isn't over till I say it's over--and I still have one last card to play\"--",
