  "description": "It's Christmas time, and newly engaged Jade Calhoun and her fiance Kane are having a party at Summer House in Cypress Settlement. The tree is decorated, the mistletoe is in place, and the crab puffs are to die for. Nothing can spoil this celebration...except for some wayward magic and a pesky ghost who crashes the party. Engaged off Bourbon Street is a 6500 word short story. It is number 3.5 in the Jade Calhoun series, right after Demons of Bourbon Street. Originally published in Holiday Wishes in 2012.",
