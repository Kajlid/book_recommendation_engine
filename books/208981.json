  "description": "Nadia Moran is an illegal wizard, an expert thief, and an occasional killer.  So robbing the mansion of the Elven noble Lord Castomyr should prove no challenge at all.  Except another thief has an eye on Lord Castomyr's treasures, a thief with magical abilities Nadia does not understand.  And unless Nadia outwits this master thief, she'll be the one left holding the bag...and among the Elves, the punishment for theft is death.",
