  "title": "The Shadow of War: A Novel of the Cuban Missile Crisis",
  "description": "New York Times bestselling author Jeff Shaara brings alive the heart-stopping days and nights of the Cuban Missile Crisis in a novel featuring his trademark \"you are there\" immediacy. Ripe for Jeff Shaara's vivid alchemy of fact-based fiction, here is the Cuban Missile Crisis as readers have never seen it. In addition to the tension-filled corridors of power in Washington, Moscow, and Havana, Shaara takes us to the decks of destroyers encircling the island, playing cat and mouse with lurking Soviet subs, where the wrong move will set off a shooting war; high above to the cockpits of the U-2 spy planes whose reconnaissance was the vital touchstone against fatal uncertainty; and to the shores of Cuba itself, where CIA operatives once plotted to restore a betrayed revolution. The perfect follow-up to Shaara's widely praised novel on the Korean War, The Frozen Hours, The Shadow of War marks an exciting new dimension for Shaara's work, in a novel that is all too relevant today.",
