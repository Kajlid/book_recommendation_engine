  "description": "Gordy has a problem. His girlfriend, Poppy Nicole, wants to meet him in REALITY.It’s the year 2043 and Twitter, Facebook, You Tube, reality television and Ebay have all merged into the VidNet. Everyone and anyone can have a VidNet show, but it’s the people who are rated, not the shows, on a scale from Purple to Red.Poppy just knows that if she and Gordy meet in REALITY , and better yet, have sex in REALITY, on her vid show, it’s sure to boost her rating from Yellow to Orange and maybe even Red. But the prospect of REALITY sex makes Gordy so nervous he fails to heed the warning signs of a worldwide economic collapse (caused by a bubble in imaginary toothpaste sales). Will Gordy be able to save VidNet Society? More importantly, will he and Poppy have sex in REALITY? The answers lie in Rate Me Red.",
