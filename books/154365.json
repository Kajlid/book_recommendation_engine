  "title": "In All Things: A Return to the Drooling Ward",
  "description": "In 1970, a seventeen-year-old trainee enters the psychiatric technician training program at Sonoma State Hospital. Having volunteered there as a high school student, he feels fairly well prepared and presumes that conditions like those in Jack London’s 1914 short story about the place, “Told in the Drooling Ward” are a thing of the past. He soon discovers that what really happens behind the closed doors of the institution has not changed much since London’s time, certainly not for the better.Taught the “necessary” skill of how to choke out a patient on his first day, and told with a shrug that sometimes when patients run away to the nearby hills, they’re never found, the young trainee is thrust into a world of austere realities that most adults would balk at entering.Based on author Ed Davis’s real-life experiences, In All Things is an honest reflection of a pivotal time in his life, as well as a compelling social commentary on how mental institutions were run in the 1970s. Told as a fictionalized, first-person narrative and expressed with stirring compassion, his story is an open door into a dark part of our history that will stay with you long after you read the last page.",
