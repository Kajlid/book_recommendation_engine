A cancerous species of invaders plaguing our region of the galaxy and must be dealt with.  In DEATH WORLD, McGill faces an ever more threatening universe. He learns why the Cephalopod Kingdom has yet to attack Earth, and whatâ€™s happening behind the scenes in the Core Worlds. Throughout, he maintains his unbending sense of right, wrong and honor.
