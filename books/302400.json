  "description": "Maddox WilliamsWhat happens when the bad stuff that's happened in your life outweighs the good in you? You take off the white knight armor and take matters into your own hands. At least, that's what Maddox thinks he needs to do to pay back the Reapers MC, the motorcycle club full of scum who's haunted him and his family's life. But things are never what they seem to be. She quiets his storms and soothes his rage. When he's with her, she gives him moments of clarity and reprieve from his grief. The only thing wrong with this rosy picture? She's the enemy. Though Maddox isn't a patched member of the Knights of Havoc MC, his story is so intertwined with theirs and his life changes yet again the moment they set foot in his town. **Though this installment can be read as a stand-alone novel, it is recommended that you read the first installment. Novels should be read consecutively.**",
