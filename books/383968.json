  "description": "\" The Breakfast Club meets Chopping Mall as directed by David Lynch.\" -- Brian Keene , author of The Rising Ten ridiculously stereotypical consumer victims (a yuppie, a housewife, a retiree, a jock, a bible thumper, a cowboy, a preppy, a gamer, a goth, and a white suburban gangsta) find themselves unable to leave the mall one day. There is nothing stopping them. The doors are unlocked. Other shoppers are able to come and go as they please. But for some inexplicable reason, these ten people cannot pry themselves away from their shopping miasma. The mall closes, and they won't leave. Days pass, and they're still there, eating meals in the food court and sleeping in department store bedroom displays. Then they begin to die off, one by one, murdered by a mysterious killer, and they still won't allow themselves to escape. Carlton Mellick III's \"The Menstruating Mall\" is both a modernized take on Luis Bunuel's \"The Exterminating Angel,\" and a parody of Agatha Christie's \"And Then There Were None.\" Featuring mock mall advertisements by retard punk hero Food Fortunata and cover art by Skin242.",
