  "description": "Was this a new life - or a death sentence?When Rankin Johnson boards a flight to Israel, he expects an adventure in archeology. But the airplane comes under attack and explodes in midair. Rankin shouts, \"God, I'm yours!\" Instantly, he's in some other place. An angel informs Rankin the Lord is pleased to accept his offer. He dubs Rankin \"the next Fithian\" - a messenger from God, not to Earth, but to planet Zemna in the alternate dimension. What happened to the previous Fithian? \"He was killed,\" the angel says before vanishing.On Zemna, Rankin finds a perplexing, violent world. Futuristic technology mingles with primitive ways. Also, a bizarre symbol-the Intersection of All Things-has appeared on his left palm. It's a tool to aid his mission, but how? Rankin is supposed to share God's message with this planet. Instead, he becomes a slave. What he really wants is a trip back to Earth.With the aid of a brother and sister who become his best friends, Rankin escapes. He hopes to fulfill his mission and return home as fast as possible. But now there's a price on Rankin's head. More than one Zemnan would rather kill him for the reward than hear what he has to say.",
