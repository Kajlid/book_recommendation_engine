A place where a group of young girls are busy grooming the beautiful beasts and getting them ready for competition--with all the ups and downs, all the drama that inevitably results! Dragonsdale is such a place. The stable is run by Cara's father, but, after a tragic dragon accident in which her mother lost her life, Cara herself is strictly forbidden to fly. Yet she cannot resist the lure of the magical fire-breathing creatures, and so in secret she trains Skydancer, her rare, wild Goldenbrow dragon, and dreams of the day when she, too, can take flight.",
