  "description": "Ever consider what the beast really wanted with his young Beauty? Find out in this collection of wittily reimagined fairy tales for a strictly adult audience.In the title story, a haughty princess parades in front of her people and ends up showing off far more than her leadership skills. A modern-day Cinderella attends the palace ball in a pair of black patent-leather stiletto heels guaranteed to bring the foot-worshiping prince to his knees. The seven dwarves prove that what they lack in size they more than make up for in numbers; young Jackie learns more about pleasure from a beanstalk than she ever thought possible; and Goldie realizes that nothing is too hot when she sets about finding out which of three “bare” bachelors is neither too big nor too small, but just right.Little Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Sleeping Beauty–the erotic potential of these classic fairy tales and more is finally and fully realized in Hillary Rollins’s entertaining and titillating collection of bedtime stories for grown-ups. If you ever have trouble falling asleep, or if you want to get your partner in the mood to call it a day, try snuggling under the covers with these beautifully written and erotically self-assured tales from the annals of childhood. Better yet, read them aloud. There are few pleasures greater than sharing a good story with someone you love.",
