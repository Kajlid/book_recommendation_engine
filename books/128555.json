  "description": "The fourth of these excursions into the Edwardian era follows the course of the London 'Season', a more fashionable and sophisticated milieu than those through which the boy and girl made their way in previous volumes.Besides the debutante's coming-out ball, we are privileged to visit sporting events at Henley, Ascot and Lord's and even taste a little night-life at Romano's and the stage-door of the Gaiety Theatre.Once again Mr Goodall has produced an enchanting evocation of a vanished age.",
