  "title": "She Came From Beyond!",
  "description": "Esme “Easy” Hardwick, is the geek eye candy on a cable access show that’s a cross between Mystery Science Theater 3000 and Elvira. She was raised in San Francisco by two gay dads, and although an inebriated Jim Nabors once told her that her mother was Adrienne Barbeau, her biological origins remain a mystery to her. Now on the cusp of thirty and a very minor celebrity in Troubador, Oregon, Easy is content with her quiet life in a go-nowhere town and her internet flirtations with ardent fans. But when Syfy picks up her show and her online message board repartee with one of her fans carries over into real life romance, complete with ex-wives, children, and unexpected pregnancy, things quickly spin out of control and she’s forced into a reckoning with her past in order to embrace a future she never could have anticipated.",
