  "description": "Charlotte Powers is fifteen years old, overloaded with superpowers, and ready. Ready to start adventuring, ready to fight evil, ready to sort things out.There's a problem, though. Not with her powers, she has super strength and super agility and phase-shifting, a combination that is unique even in BEING a combination; nobody else has ever had multiple superpowers. The problem is that her parents don't think she's ready for the world--or that the world is ready for her.So instead of going adventuring she's sent to a nice, normal school, ostensibly to establish a Public Identity.And that's where it all goes wrong ...\"Power Down\" is the first book in the Charlotte Powers series.",
