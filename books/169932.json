  "description": "He's a shape-shifting wolf, she's a psychic and his other half. In order to catch a killer he has to rely on his Seeing Eye Mate. Caelan Graham is on the hunt for a shape-shifter bent on killing female mates. As Prime, its Caelans duty to protect his entire pack, so its a good thing he doesn't have a mate of his own to look after right now. Too bad the most alluring female has just walked past his nose. As a clairvoyant, Tieran Jones has given up on men and their lack of understanding her gift until Caelan. The man ignites her passion, sets off a vision of a gruesome wolf attack, then shows up in her bed. In wolf form. To top it all off, he keeps insisting she's his mate. When the attacks continue, Tieran's visions evolve and point in one direction. Caelan's twin brother. With a lack of physical evidence, Caelan must depend on Tieran's sight for clues. An act making her a prime target.Warning, this title contains the following: explicit sex, graphic language, and violence.",
