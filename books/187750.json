  "description": "\"It's not just for a week anymore, Princess. A week isn't long enough. I need more. I need forever.\"   Rule #12 â€“ You can tease me, Ethan, and we can play, but you can't be mean to me. I need to know that there's more, that this isn't wrong, that you feel the same way I feel...  I never wanted to hide this from you, Dad. It wasn't about that. It wasn't that I was ashamed or thought I was doing anything wrong, but I didn't think you'd understand and I wanted to be with Ashley. I want to keep being with her, and whenever I thought about telling you, and then thought about you getting mad about it... well, yeah, that's it.  How am I supposed to date her if you're angry about us dating? That's why I didn't tell you. This isn't a fling to me, it's serious.  She's too much, but she's never enough, too. When I'm with Ashley she's the only thing I can think about. When I kiss her, I mean it. There's a difference there, a difference between just kissing, or kissing because of lust, or a sweet and nice kiss, or kissing because you really mean it. There's all sorts of different kinds of feelings, but that last one is the most important. That's the one I feel when I'm with her.  It's crazy. This entire thing is crazy. I love it. I love her, and I want you to understand that...",
