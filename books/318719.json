  "description": "Tara is thrown into a parallel universe. It was bad enough that she had lost her husband. But now, she had lost her home, job and identity. Forced to seek refuge from a vampire, she thought life couldn't get much worse. She was then surprised when she found a parallel version of her husband, who was very much alive and well. She thought she was given a second chance at love. But things were more complicated than that. Not only was her husband not so easy to win over, but the vampire who helped her out now claimed he was madly in love with her and wouldn't leave her alone.",
