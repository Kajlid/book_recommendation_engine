  "description": "What I wanted for my birthday: Books.What I got for my birthday: my brother’s best friend playing matchmaker.Let it be known that I, Kinsley Lane, am one hundred percent against being set up with somebody.And I’m one thousand percent sure that Josh Carter is not the man to find me a boyfriend.I mean, if I’m so great, why isn’t he the one dating me? (For the record, I don’t know the answer. That’s just what the guy on the internet asked.)Still, I’ll humor him. If I go on his little dates, he’ll teach my bookish, introverted self how not to be totally, completely, utterly, unforgivably awkward on every single one of them.And all I have to do is fall in love with one of the lovely gentlemen he’s serving up for me on a silver platter—all of whom fit my very specific guidelines.Simple, right?It would be.If only I could stop falling for Josh.",
