  "description": "New girl Lucy is desperate for friends. She tries out for Beachwood High soccer, but despite her amazingly accurate kick, fails to make the team. When the Coach points out that varsity football is looking for a new kicker, Lucy is skeptical. Football? Isn?t that a boys? game? But on the gridiron Lucy discovers that she feels strong?in control for the first time since her mother died. She loves football. She actually wants to play! (She also wants to hang out with super-cute quarterback Ryan Conner. But that?s just icing on the cake.) Too bad no one else wants her on the team. Not the boys? coach, not her teammates, and especially not her overprotective dad. Will Lucy cave in to the pressure? Or will she prove she?s pretty tough after all?",
