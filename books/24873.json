  "description": "Meet Sam Hunter. Ex-cop, low-rent private investigator working the back-streets of Philadelphia. Sam has issues—personal and psychological—but he’s good at what he does. When a beautiful blond from the Main Line hires him to protect her from her gangster ex-husband, Sam thinks it’s going to be a by-the-numbers gig. He’s wrong. David Skye is far more than a criminal –he’s an actual monster. Everyone is afraid of him. They should be. Everyone…except Sam, who brings a whole new kind of ‘mean’ to the mean streets. Things are about to get messy.Like Part of the Family is the first short story in a new series by New York Times bestseller and multiple Bram Stoker award-winning author Jonathan Maberry (Patient Zero, Dead of Night). Fans of Jim Butcher and Laurell K. Hamilton will enjoy the first bloody adventure of a new kind of hero from the darkest side of town.",
