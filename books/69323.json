  "description": "Five years ago, Ben Conner killed a man. If that were the worst of it, he could have swallowed the guilt, but the man had a son—an eleven-year-old boy who was now no one’s son. When he returns home to Northstar in a last-ditch effort to flee his guilt and nightmares, he prays he can reconnect with his best friend June Montana, because he knows her friendship is the only thing that can help him find peace. Instead of the escape he hoped for, Ben is reunited with the boy he orphaned. He will have to face the consequences of that fateful night or risk destroying his friendship with June. Before he can begin to forgive himself, an entirely new and disturbing problem arises. Someone from June’s past wants revenge for a broken heart… and he’s willing to kill to get it.",
