  "description": "In Call of the Whisperwind, author Jeffree Wyn Itrich continues the adventurous saga of the Bradshaw family in the Wild West of 19th century New Mexico. Although she willingly stayed in the past to marry the greatest love she has ever known, a few years into her blissful marriage to Matthew Bradshaw time traveler Rachel is restless. As an accomplished woman out of the 21st century, cooking, cleaning and child rearing do not provide the kind of stimulation she was accustomed to in the future. She dearly loves Matt and her daughter, but wants more. In the 19th century she doesnâ€™t know where to turn, what she can do. Her old friend, the Magical Jeweler, suggests she use her medical skills from the 21st century. With the help of her sister-in-law she undergoes training as a traditional folk healer with a family of curanderas in Northern New Mexico. However, what seems like an uncomplicated career is anything but when she finds herself in the center of a murder investigation.",
