  "description": "It was a balmy evening late in May. My son Daniel had left for work, or so I thought. I heard the doorbell ringing and opened the front door. There stood an extremely agitated Daniel. 'Someone has run over a baby raccoon, and its sibling just ran through the yard to the back of our house.'Thus begins A Tale of Two Raccoons, the true story of playful, mischievous raccoons being absorbed into human families.When wisdom, empathy, tenderness, and respect are applied, the results are trust, loyalty, and love. Alternately, neglect and abuse create anger, frustration, and destruction.A story of love and acceptance, A Tale of Two Raccoons will tug on readers' heartstrings and bring a tear to readers' eyes.",
