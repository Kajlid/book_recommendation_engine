  "description": "I NEVER wanted to be a daredevil. Even as the 49-year old adult that I am, I still don’t want to ride a roller coaster or jump out of a perfectly good airplane. And I don’t understand people who want to do those things - even my lifelong best friend.And yet, here I am, holding a list of daredevil-ish things in my hand at my best friend’s will reading.I am SO going to get her back for this in the afterlife.So, my outgoing, adventurous best friend decided to leave me her estate but only if I completed her bucket list. HERS, not mine. And I have to do it before I turn 50 because she didn’t make it to 50.I don’t know if it’s appropriate to want to kill someone who’s already dead, but I can’t help how I feel.Still, I want to honor her wishes. And I kind of want that beach house she left me, too.The next few months will either change my life, or I might join her in heaven if one goes terribly wrong.\nOrder The Bucket List for a funny women’s fiction saga that will make you smile, cry, and maybe make you want to go on an adventure yourself!",
