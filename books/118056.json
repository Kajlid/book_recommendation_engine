But gorgeously defiant Arabella sparks frustration - and something deeply erotic - in Marcus. After matching both wits and swords with her, Marcus concludes that this beautiful and formidable foe must be his.\n\nHaving sworn off marriage and men, Arabella wishes to be left alone to run her finishing school for young ladies. To that end, she boldly accepts Marcus's intimate challenge: If he can woo and win her within two weeks, she'll take her place in his bed as his wife. However, if she can resist his considerable charms, the Loring sisters will be granted their independence. Thus an extraordinary game of seduction begins. . . .\n\n\"Nicole Jordan puts the steam in steamy. A smoldering hero and delightful heroine make this a sizzling read.
