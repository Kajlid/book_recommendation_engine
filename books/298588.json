  "description": "Finalist for the 2002 National Book Award, Young People's LiteratureHonor book for the 2003 Boston Globe/Horn Book Award (Fiction category)The Barnes & Noble ReviewBrave New World takes a romantic teen twist in this disarming, engrossing novel set in a hyper-computerized future.Spending time partying on the moon and riding around in his \"upcar,\" Titus is an average teen of the future, complete with a computer chip implant -- the \"Feed\" -- that lets corporate marketers and government agencies broadcast directly into his brain. Then Titus meets Violet, and an anti-Feed hacker shuts down their Feeds for a short time; but when Violet's Feed is seriously damaged, she begins spouting some radical ideas.M. T. Anderson has predicted the future, and it's startling indeed. Although Titus is a good, well-meaning kid, his blissful ignorance of the control over him leaves readers thinking twice about the destiny of earth's citizens. Beneath the book's techno-veneer, however, lies a romantic tale between a boy who gives into the system and a girl who sees beyond it. All told, Feed is a \"meg\" remarkable work of science fiction, and once readers begin, they'll be caught up in its powerful grip. Matt Warner",
