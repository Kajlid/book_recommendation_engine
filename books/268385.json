  "title": "False Bingo: Stories",
  "description": "In Jac Jemc's dislocating second story collection, False Bingo, we watch as sinister forces (some supernatural, some of this earth, some real, and some not) work their ways into the mundanity of everyday life. In \"Strange Loop,\" an outcast attempting to escape an unnamed mistake spends his days taxiderming animals, while in \"Delivery,\" a family watches as their dementia-addled, basement-dwelling father succumbs to an online shopping addiction. \"Dont Let's\" finds a woman, recently freed from an abusive relationship, living in an isolated vacation home in the South that might be haunted by breath-stealing ghosts. Fueled by paranoia and visceral suspense, and crafted with masterful restraint, these seventeen stories explore what happens when our fears cross over into the real, if only for a fleeting moment. Identities are stolen, alternate universes are revealed, and innocence is lost as the consequences of minor, seemingly harmless decisions erupt to sabotage a false sense of stability. False Bingo is a collection of realist fables exploring how conflicting moralities can coexist: the good, the bad, the indecipherable.",
