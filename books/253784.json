  "title": "Island of Hope, Island of Tears: The Story of Those Who Entered the New World through Ellis Island - In Their Own Words",
  "description": "Between 1892 and the early 1950s, nearly 15 million people streamed through Ellis Island in search of a new life. Here are the stories of those extraordinary immigrants, largely in their own poignant words. Coming primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe, and from widely diverse backgrounds, the émigrés represented in this remarkable volume recount their adventures with dignity, wit, and unflagging honesty. Among the dozens of unforgettable narrators you'll meet are a Greek boy who, forced into the Turkish Army, escaped to the U.S. with the help of the Russian Orthodox Church; a young Polish girl who made the harrowing journey only to have to flee a \"white slaver\"; and a Czech woman who fooled doctors into letting her travel despite being eight months pregnant.",
