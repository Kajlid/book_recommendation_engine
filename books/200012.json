  "description": "For a limited time only, Amanda's Scott's sexy hit, PLEASING HIM, available now as a complete series. On SALE for only 0.99!   MISTAKES HAPPEN…   Taylor Ward should know, she’s certainly made her fair share of them in the past. So when she moved to Boston, she knew she had just one last chance to make something out of her life, and she made a promise to herself along the way - the moment she caught even a whiff of trouble, run.  But when she finds herself in a room that she knew better than to enter in the first place, she does exactly the opposite. Taylor could smell trouble from a mile away, but she just couldn’t help herself the moment she spots the sinfully gorgeous billionaire author bad boy, Colton Marcus.   SOME JUST CAN’T BE UNDONE.   Marcus is lying in wait. And whenever the billionaire sets his sights on any given target, he never misses.  Ever.  Only now the billionaire has a brand new target – Taylor herself. And the harder the two of them try to forge through their own devious web of lust and secrecy, the harder it becomes for either one of them to turn back and go the other way.  Not that they mind. Because neither one of them is about to admit the dark, hidden truths behind their pasts… Not if they want to survive.",
