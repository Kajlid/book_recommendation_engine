Fighting in an underground fight ring is the way she makes enough money to survive, but a new fighter in the ring upends the careful life plan she’s been trying to follow. Max is intimidating with a scar on his neck and muscles for days. He never smiles and seldom speaks. But he knows his way around a fight ring and quickly rises through the ranks. No surprise there. What is surprising is that he seems to be everywhere she is and won’t let her exist in her lonely world anymore. When her career in the fight ring is upended, his alpha gives her an offer she can’t refuse. Come to find out, she’s a harbinger; which explains the weird visions she’s been having. Her arrival in the pack heralds the coming war. That figures. She should have known she would be a curse; that seems to fit her life so well. Yet, in spite of the war that’s coming, she may have finally found a place to belong and someone to belong to if she can allow herself to accept it. The Wolves of the Northwoods have so much to lose in this war—new mates, babies both born and unborn. They’ve never faced a greater threat; but they will rise to the occasion and unite with other packs to finish this thing once and for all, no matter the cost.**If you like paranormal romance with fated mates, protective males, and strong females, this series is for you.
