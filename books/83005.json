  "description": "Nine Inches, Tom Perrotta's first true collection, features ten stories―some sharp and funny, some mordant and surprising, and a few intense and disturbing. Whether he's dropping into the lives of two teachers―and their love lost and found―in \"Nine Inches\", documenting the unraveling of a dad at a Little League game in \"The Smile on Happy Chang's Face\", or gently marking the points of connection between an old woman and a benched high school football player in \"Senior Season\", Perrotta writes with a sure sense of his characters and their secret longings.Nine Inches contains an elegant collection of short fiction: stories that are as assured in their depictions of characters young and old, established and unsure, as any written today.",
