  "description": "FIGHT BARE. FIGHT HARD. FIGHT WITHOUT END.  Rose Merchante never anticipates danger on a boring winter evening. Nor does she expect the hard bodied hero who appears like a guardian angel, saving her from an unspeakable attack. When her tattooed savior offers self-defense lessons, Rosie discovers something else in her dormant flesh.  Hunger. Fire. Lust. The carnal calling for his touch is unlike anything she's ever known.  Trainer and underground fighter William Gaulle saved the beautiful woman in the alley without hesitation. But Rosie's all temptress in his studio, awakening his deepest, primal desires.  William can't ignore the obvious. She's perfect to dominate, perfect to own, perfect to make a baby with.  He wants a submissive to possess. She wants a man to make her whole.  Soon, they're training long, hard, and unprotected between the sheets, but a fighter's world has stern demands...will Rosie be left behind, or can she carve a place in his hardened heart forever?
