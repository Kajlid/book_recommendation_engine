  "description": "Young, untried, but a lethally trained fighter, Zelde M'Tana found herself legally shanghaied by the oppressive UET, imprisoned on a starship bound for the brothels of a mining planet. There was no way Zelde was going to stand for that, and when the ship's first officer, Parnell, led an anti-UET revolt, Zelde joined the mutineers and single-handedly turned defeat into victory.First as Parnell's lover, then as his assistant, Zelde was mistrusted by the crew,but when the UET struck again and Parnell died, there was only one choice for captain: Zelde M'Tana.Zelde M'Tana is a main character in the Rissa Kerguelen Bran Tregare series. This book delves into her childhood, adolescence and early adulthood giving you an even greater appreciation of Zelde. While it is technically a prequel to the main series, it can be read at any point the reader wants insight into this character without over powering the storyline of the Rissa saga.",
