  "description": "Long ago, before humans forgot them for all eternity, monsters and immortals retreated below ground to seek shelter. But what do the Greek Gods do when they're bored? They bring back the Olympic games--only a lethal version. The newest contender in these bigger, deadlier games is a young human girl they kidnapped from the streets above. For Kira Lier, itâ€™s kill or be killed as she races against beasts she thought were just myths, to cross the finish line and win a chance to earn her freedom.",
