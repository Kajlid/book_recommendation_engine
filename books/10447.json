  "description": "Earth's wildly overpopulated surface was frenetic--its seething, rich, pleasure-loving billions reaching, unaware, toward the mass hysteria that had periodically destroyed lesser groups of mammals in an earlier age. Cults, fads, madnesses of various kinds swept the population. The maddest--and so far the most permanent--were the Vorst worshipers, the atom adorers, the believers in immortality through technology. But immortality was itself a madness under the circumstances. Unless it could be used to get men to the stars. Yet there were those, the Harmonists, who believed that technology could never do it. They were right. And so were the Vorsters. No man fights as viciously as the man who knows he is right.",
