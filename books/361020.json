  "description": "This is a fantasy tale of a young girl named Micah and her adventure with a hypochondriacal dragon called Raif. This story is underpinned by a mystical theme and the idea that a person's actions can affect their future life. The story begins with the disappearance of Micah's mother, so she is sent to live with her Aunt Denwyn who is an unsavory character. Micah runs away from her aunt through a gate at the bottom of the garden, not realising that she has passed through a gap in time into a different dimension. While there, she enters a cottage where she finds a terrified dragon with low self-esteem. Micah and Raif soon become friends and set off to rescue Micah's mother, Lluan Ravenlight.",
