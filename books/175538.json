  "description": "When Marine sniper Riley Kendall retired to live the quiet life, he never thought bullets would start flying through his house. It’s hardly the first time a woman’s wanted to kill him, but it’s the first time one has actually tried. For assassin Jordan Hunt, just name the target, meet her price, and she’ll take care of the rest. This time, the man visible through her rifle’s viewport is too sexy to kill, but a job’s a job. When she misses and finds herself trussed naked before him, she may find her excitement harder to hide than who hired her.",
