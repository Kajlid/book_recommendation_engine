  "description": "Built for death…altered by love. When the world convulsed under the burden of overpopulation, hardly anyone noticed a few girls going missing. Turned against her will into something out of a horror movie, Anna was one of those girls. But she learns to control the hungry monster she has become, and she gets out. After orchestrating the escape from the secret lab, Anna leads a faction of freed vampires and searches for a peaceful balance between human society and her new family. Then she meets Grant. Grant walks into Anna’s world unafraid, looking for adventure, on a quest for something to believe in, something to fight for. But love is a complication Anna can’t afford. Not when she’s in a power struggle with a rival group of vampires and another laboratory in another prison has been discovered. Except Grant won’t be pushed away easily. Anna needs all the vampires to work together to take down the laboratory, and the leader of the rival faction has shown a deadly interest in Grant. Contains a reluctant vampire and a hero who doesn’t hesitate to step into the danger zone to be with her.",
