  "description": "Kyle is a rising bodybuilding champion. Driven and focused, he is also a beautiful yet enigmatic loner with a dark side.  Teenage Danny (called “Opie” by his friends) is enjoying his last summer in Charleston before going off to college. His sexual awakening parallels his burgeoning interest in bodybuilding as he befriends his role model, Kyle. Bernard is an aging, cynical, yet humorous gay man, once a bodybuilder himself but now mainly a worshiper of muscle with a thing for Kyle…a fixation that ultimately leads to tragedy.  At once poignant and gritty, Eutawville follows these three denizens of a small gym, alternating among their points of view as their lives intertwine.",
