  "description": "I can't stand arrogant bad boys - especially not when they're my loud, obnoxious new next-door neighbors.  Not even when they come in muscled, tattooed, too-hot-for-their-own-good packages. I'm a good girl - successful, responsible, and smart.  I have to be - the eyes of the nation are on me. I'm the daughter of the President of the United States. Dating a filthy, cocky, possessive football player would be the ultimate scandal. Falling in love with TWO arrogant athletes in the middle of my father's re-election campaign?  That would be another thing entirely.I’m twice as screwed. Author's This is a MFM ménage romance! So if you're not into the idea of two hot athletes falling head over heels for one girl, then take a pass on this one! There are no M/M scenes – this is all about the woman. There’s basically no football in here, either. But let’s be real - are you reading one of my books for the football? ;)",
