  "description": "Beauty can be a gift...or a wicked temptation...So it is for Filippo Lippi, growing up in Renaissance Florence. He has a talent - not only can he see the beauty in everything, he can capture it, paint it. But while beauty can seduce you, and art can transport you - it cannot always feed you or protect you. To survive, Filippo di Tommaso Lippi, street urchin, forger, drinker, seducer of nuns must become Fra Fra Filippo Lippi - Carmelite friar, man of God. Yet at the same time he is Lippo Lippi, creator of some the most radiantly beautiful paintings, Botticelli's teacher, Medici's confidante.So who is he really - lover, believer, father, teacher, artist? Which man? Which life? Is anything true except the paintings? An extraordinary journey of passion, art and intrigue, The Painter of Souls takes us to a time and place in Italy's history where desire reigns and salvation is found in the strangest of places.",
