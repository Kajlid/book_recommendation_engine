That's the question facing Bailey Connors, who is dumped by her girlfriend, saddled with the 22-year-old daughter of a network executive and driven close to madness by a friend's attempt at matchmaking. To top it off, she has been ordered to kill off the soap's leading lady on a special live episode, which will either be a disaster or the triumph of her career. But either way, love may be waiting on the other side in a very unexpected manner. Sharon Stone is the author of Love Letters in the Sand and lives in Tampa, Florida.",
