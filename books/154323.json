  "title": "Life After Death: An Experiential Exploration With Mediums By an Agnostic Investigator",
  "description": "Is there life after death? An agnostic investigator explores this question through the communications of mediums in a variety of settings at a Spiritualist camp in Maine-inclusive of interviews and personal experiential sessions (sittings), seances, and diverse workshops. Through a combination of direct personal experience, self-reflections, and critical analysis, all of which was part of his psychology Ph.D. dissertation research at Saybrook University, Elliot Benjamin comes to his own experiential conclusions concerning the question of life after death. The book includes a foreword written by one of the mediums who participated in this study.",
