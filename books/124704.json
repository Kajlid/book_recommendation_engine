  "title": "Mean Business On North Ganson Street",
  "description": "A distraught businessman kills himself after a short, impolite conversation with a detective named Jules Bettinger. Because of this incident, the unkind (but decorated) policeman is forced to relocate himself and his family from Arizona to the frigid north, where he will work for an understaffed precinct in Victory, Missouri. This collapsed rustbelt city is a dying beast that devours itself and its inhabitants...and has done so for more than four decades. Its streets are covered with dead pigeons and there are seven hundred criminals for every law enforcer.Partnered with a boorish and demoted corporal, Bettinger investigates a double homicide in which two policemen were slain and mutilated. The detective looks for answers in the fringes of the city and also in the pasts of the cops with whom he works--men who stomped on a local drug dealer until he was disabled.Bettinger soon begins to suspect that the double homicide is not an isolated event, but a prelude to a series of cop executions...The author is currently adapting this book into a movie for Warner Brothers; Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio are both attached to the project.",
