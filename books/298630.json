These too stand out.\"Are you Ready to Love yourself a Black Man?\" allows us, readers of literature/purveyors of society a direct view of our relationships with African-American men. The collection, short in pages, is full of depth and deep introspection on concepts such as mental health issues, relationship and family conflict, and intracultural strife, to systematic oppression, racism, prejudice, and sexism. Amos explores his observations, contributions, and position on these topics.Built with lyric in mind, the underbelly of each poem is rhythm. This beat tells the story of the Black Man, and his relationship with the world. Completely relevant and in desperate need of reflection by a society that still hasn't fully experienced the love of a man of color, \"Are you Ready to Love yourself a Black Man?\" is meant to be read by all regardless of color, race, religion, sex, or gender.It is a book designed to start conversations and discussions on the topic that matters most: humanity is universal.",
