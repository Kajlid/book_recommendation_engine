  "description": "A hilarious collection of stories from the life of the New York Times bestselling author of Look Again At last, together in one collection, are Lisa Scottoline's wildly popular Philadelphia Inquirer columns. In her column, Lisa lets her hair down, roots and all, to show the humorous side of life from a woman's perspective. The Sunday column debuted in 2007 and on the day it started, Lisa wrote, \"I write novels, so I usually have 100,000 words to tell a story. In a column there's only 700 words. I can barely say hello in 700 words. I'm Italian.\" The column gained momentum and popularity. Word of mouth spread, and readers demanded a collection. Why My Third Husband Will Be a Dog is that collection. Seventy vignettes. Vintage Scottoline. In this collection, you'll laugh • Being caught braless in the emergency room • Betty and Veronica's Life Lessons for Girls • A man's most important body part • Interrupting as an art form • A religion men and women can worship • Real estate ads as porn • Spanx are public enemy number one • And so much more about life, love, family, pets, and the pursuit of jeans that actually fit!",
