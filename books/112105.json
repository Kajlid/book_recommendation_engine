  "title": "American Dream: Three Women, Ten Kids, and a Nation's Drive to End Welfare",
  "description": "Bill Clinton's drive to \"end welfare\" sent 9 million women and children streaming from the rolls. In this masterful work, New York Times reporter and two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist Jason DeParle cuts between the mean streets of Milwaukee and the corridors of Washington to produce the definitive account. As improbable as fiction, and equally fast-paced, this classic of literary journalism has captured the acclaim of the Left and Right. At the heart of the story are three cousins, inseparable at the start but launched on differing arcs. Leaving welfare, Angie puts her heart in her work. Jewell bets on an imprisoned man. Opal guards a tragic secret that threatens her kids and her life. DeParle traces back their family history six generations to slavery, and weaves poor people, politicians, reformers, and rogues into a spellbinding epic. At times, the very idea of America seemed on trial: we live in a country where anyone can make it, yet generation after generation some families don't. Washington Post: \"Riveting... like a searing novel of urban realism - Theodore Dreiser comes to Milwaukee.\" Chicago Tribune: \"Sweeping scope and dramatic detail worthy of Charles Dickens.\"",
