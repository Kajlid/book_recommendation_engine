  "description": "Set against transcendent love, unrelenting hatred and loyalties to friends and family, Turquoise is the story of an enduring and passionate love affair between Yasmin and Renan, which spans two decades, two marriages and three continents. Yasmin and her Armenian classmate Ani were oblivious to ethnic differences during their school years in Istanbul. Years later they run into each other, and Ani introduces Renan, her husband, to Yasmin. At that moment under the blazing autumn skies, as Yasmin locks eyes with Renan, she knows that she has come upon her destiny. But political tensions in their land soon force Renan, her secret love, and his family to immigrate to Sydney. A few years on, Yasmin’s diplomat father is appointed as the Turkish Consul General to Los Angeles where the family faces a devastating tragedy that will impact their lives in ways unfathomable. She is now forced to make a choice between passion that defines her and reason that guides her. When so much is stacked against Yasmin and Renan, how can love possibly triumph? This is a big, powerful novel of love, angst, political unrest and ethnic hatred. The author has skilfully penned these pages so that the characters are raw and real, their emotions searing, their plight palpable. An engrossing work. Look out for the sequel, Emerald, which is currently underway. —Wendy O’Hanlon, Acres Australia Turquoise is not a simple romance but a tale of passion and love – the love of a child, a job, two countries and a man. —Dot Whittington, The Weekender With characters who come across as completely flawed and human, you will be pulled into this well-written novel that runs the full gamut of emotions and relationships. —John Morrow’s Pick of the Week",
