  "description": "From bestselling author, Dr. Rebecca Sharp, comes a sexy, suspenseful contemporary romance with a dark fairy tale twist...Deformed. Dangerous. Damned.One night ripped my life away and left me a monster—the scarred gargoyle of a man who lived in the stained-glass shadows of a crumbling cathedral, selling my soul in order to seek vengeance on those who destroyed my life.Until one day, the chimes I heard weren’t from the bell tower of Notre Dame, but from the bejeweled gypsy invading my space.Though she swears her research is legitimate, her beauty shimmers with secrets. I can’t trust glittering eyes that aren’t repulsed by me, nor the tempting smile that is laden with lust. I can’t trust her.So, I’ll watch and wait… and ignore how her sharp wit and bewitching charm scorch the shackles of my restraint and enchant me into her fire.I’ll uncover the truth before she gets too close. Before she sees the broken man beneath the scarred beast. And before I give into her temptation.She’s a threat to everything I’ve worked for—a threat to my cathedral and a threat to my revenge. And, most dangerous of all, a threat to my stone cold heart.",
