  "description": "Liz Drummond was a pale and slender Scottish beauty - and the proud possessor of an indomitable, fiery spirit. Cunningly, she disguised herself in her brother's clothes to join the adored Bonnie Prince Charlie in his glorious campaign to reclaim the throne of England. Then she met Kit Moncrieff, a roguish soldier of fortune and the Prince's most trusted advisor - a man as compelling and perhaps as treacherous as the devil himself. Soon an unlikely and storm-tossed passion grew between them, in spite of what they pretended to be. Charlie's skirmishes and the urgings of their own hearts began to hurl Liz and Kit toward ever more reckless challenges - in a dizzying panorama of dramatic adventure, full-bodied humor, and a singular affair. From the moors of Scotland to the great halls of England, they join their destinies in a rich story which will delight and move you - and which you will never forget!",
