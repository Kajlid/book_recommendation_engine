  "description": "“The bones were old and discolored by the soil they had lain in. But the rain had washed clean the hand and about six inches of the ulna and radius. The hand and finger bones were separated and slightly scattered. But on one of the fingers shone a metal object. Elodie bent down and her eyes widened when she saw that it was a ring—and no ordinary ring.”This 6th Elodie Fontaine Mystery finds the high school sleuth trying to solve her first murder. Trouble is, the murder happened 20 years ago and a strong hurricane has just devastated the ancient crime scene at Maudry Manor--an artists retreat owned by a beloved author of children's stories. To top it off, her new friend Bell is being blackmailed by someone who has embarrassing selfies. Both the murderer and the blackmailer will try their hardest to make sure Elodie fails.",
