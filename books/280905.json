  "description": "Terminated for inappropriate behavior.I couldn’t believe the letter in my hands.Nine years. Nine damn years I’d worked my butt off for one of the largest companies in America, and I was fired with a form letter when I returned home from a week in Aruba. All because of a video taken when I was on vacation with my friends—a private  video made on my private time. Or so I thought…Pissed off, I cracked open a bottle of wine and wrote my own letter to the gazillionaire CEO telling him what I thought of his company and its practices.I didn’t think he’d actually respond.I certainly never thought I’d suddenly become pen pals with the rich jerk. Eventually, he realized I’d been wronged and made sure I got my job back.Only…it wasn’t the only thing Grant Lexington wanted to do for me. But there was no way I was getting involved with my boss’s boss’s boss. Even if he was ridiculously gorgeous, confident, and charming.It would be completely wrong, inappropriate even.Sort of like the video that got me into trouble to begin with.Two wrongs don’t make a right.But sometimes it’s twice as fun.",
