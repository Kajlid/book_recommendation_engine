  "description": "Librarian Note: Alternate/new cover edition for ASIN# B00EV6JOIS.  For latent vampire Gwendolyn Jones, her role is clear. Keep the males of her clan satisfied, prevent them seeking partners amongst the fragile humans, and exposing their diminishing species. Its an essential function, but contempt from the fertile females and many of her ‘clients’ makes her yearn for life where she’s considered more than a sex toy. A part time job in a souvenir shop seems like an ideal compromise, until the overwhelmingly sexy chef next door turns out not only to be a rogue latent, but one with a deluded fantasy that Gwen isn’t a vampire at all, but a succubus he’s been seeking across the globe for years.",
