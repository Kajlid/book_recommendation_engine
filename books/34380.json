  "description": "Travis Parker has everything a man could want: a god job; loyal friends; his dream home in small-town North Carolina. In full pursuit of the good life, he believes that a serious relationship with a woman would only cramp his style. That is until Gabby Holland moves in next door. Despite Travis's attempts to be friendly, she seems to have a chip on her shoulder about him. But something compels Travis to get to know his new neighbor. His persistent efforts lead them both to make a tough decision, the consequences of which neither could have foreseen.  The Choice  confronts us with the most heart-wrenching question of all: how far would you go to keep the hope of love alive?",
