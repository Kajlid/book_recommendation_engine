  "title": "So, You Said You Wanted To Get To Know Me!: Thoughts That Cross The Average Man's Mind",
  "description": "At the root of it, I believe every human is filled with an angel and a beast. Both sides have their benefits, but too much of either is not for the best. The angel side allows us to see the beauty in life; the beauty in others. The beast aids us in survival, because let us admit it, life is cruel. If we’re too angelic, then we get stepped on while we admire the flowers. If we embrace the beast too much, then destruction is left in the wake of our paths. Here I find myself, the average man, fighting the never-ending battle that resides in all of us. Though we may never be able to speak openly about it, we can write it. This is what I have done. Instead of just tucking it away, I have decided to put it out there for all of you. Here you will find the beauty of life through my eyes. The pain and anguish will be evident. To love is to live and there is a fair share of that too. Of course, everyone has their quirky side, so I included that, even though it may be strange to you. It makes perfect sense to me. I couldn’t leave out the questions about life I have either. We were born into this world with one burning question always on our mind. Why? Maybe my mind does this more than others, maybe not, but it is always working on some thought. It’s possible that some of my thoughts have crossed your mind too, but we’ll have to see. If not, then it might give you something to think about. So, here is how I look at the world, those around me, and most importantly my inner being. Here I am, at my deepest and most profound depths.",
