  "title": "Gods Behaving Badly",
  "description": "The twelve Greek gods of Olympus are alive and well in the twenty-first century, but they are crammed together in a London townhouse--and none too happy about it. For Artemis (goddess of hunting, professional dog walker), Aphrodite (goddess of beauty, telephone sex operator), and Apollo (god of the sun, TV psychic), there's no way out--until a meek housecleaner, Alice, and her would-be boyfriend, Neil, turn their world upside down.When what begins as a minor squabble between Aphrodite and Apollo escalates into an epic battle of wills, Alice and Neil must fear not only for their own lives, but for the survival of humankind. Nothing less than a true act of heroism is needed--but can these two decidedly ordinary people replicate the feats of the mythical heroes and save the world?",
