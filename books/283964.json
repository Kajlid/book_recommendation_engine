  "title": "...Or Not?",
  "description": "When 14 year-old Cassie Sullivan-smart, sensitive, and perceptive-stands up for her beliefs, the flagpole Christian majority decides she's the school Antichrist.  Cassie had no idea defending Darwin and refusing to sing \"Proud to be an American\" would be such a big deal.  But it's a brave new world of post-9/11 paranoia in her über-conservative Colorado school.  Trying to stay cool while the torments increase, Cassie wonders if anything is really worth it. Taking solace in her journal, she begins to question if simply being is what she really wants. Or Not?",
