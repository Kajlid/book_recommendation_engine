  "title": "Alex Jackson: Grommet",
  "description": "A raucous, riotous, devilish, urgent tale of a thirteen-year-old grommet, Alex. Alex, still learning to ride a skateboard, is disarmingly witty, naughty and sweet natured. He is the type of boy who kisses his mother meaningfully on the cheek before bedtime and enjoys cracking jokes with his mates down at the skate park. This is a fast-paced school adventure story that perfectly captures the essence of puberty and first love.",
