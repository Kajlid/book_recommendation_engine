  "description": "Young children often experience anxiety when they are separated from their mothers or fathers. A young guinea pig expresses her distress when her mother and father go away. \"Missing you is a heavy, achy feeling. I don't like missing you. I want you right now!\" Eventually the little guinea pig realizes that sometimes she and her parents can't be together. When that happens, she knows that others can help. \"They can snuggle with me or we can play. It helps me to be warm and close to someone. They remind me that you'll be back.\"",
