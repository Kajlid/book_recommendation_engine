  "description": "Would you disrupt the balance of the universe to avenge your family?Colette doesn’t have time for high school games. She doesn’t have time for her best friend’s schoolyard crush on her. She doesn’t have time for her brother’s overprotective behavior. And she certainly doesn’t have time for the new guy in her class, no matter how hypnotizing his eyes might be. Three months ago, Colette Belrose was murdered.Colette relives the fire every day. She can still feel the ropes that tore into her wrists as she fought to get free. She can still taste the smoke that infected her lungs and choked her. She can still smell her flesh burning as the flames consumed her. Worst of all, she can still hear the sound of her parents screams as they burned alive beside her. Three months ago, Colette Belrose was brought back to life.Thought only to be a myth, furies are reborn to protect the innocent from the same fate that they once suffered. They only have one rule: they must not hunt the ones who killed them no matter the circumstance.Cursed with an insatiable thirst for vengeance and a blinding disregard for rules, Colette will find the man who killed her parents even if it kills her.
