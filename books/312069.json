Admiral Simpson of Grantville frantically races against time to finish the USE Navy's ironclad ships - desperately needed to break the Ostender blockade of the Baltic ports. A commando unit sent by Mike Stearns to England prepares to rescue Americans being held in the Tower of London.In Amsterdam, Rebecca Stearns continues three-way negotiations with the Prince of Orange and the Spanish Cardinal-Infante who has conquered most of the Netherlands. And, in Copenhagen, the captured young USE naval officer Eddie Cantrell tries to persuade the King of Denmark to break with the Ostender alliance, all while pursuing a dangerous romantic involvement with one of the Danish princesses.Â©2007 Eric Flint and David Weber (P)2013 Recorded Books",
