And that's for the best, isn't it?Of course, this was all before a note showed up in his school lunch, informing him that Agent Nineteen had three days left to live, and that there might still be someone inside the Agency working against them. Carson has always been able to rely on his friendsâ€”but what happens when there's no one left to trust?",
