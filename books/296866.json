  "description": "When Lord Adon cast the Wagerian away from the world of Meare to live in the lands of Toll, the people must survive together until the opening of the seals of the scroll. As they wait, the daunting toll collector, Travis and his brother Cari loom over the lands prohibiting their re-entrance into Meare, where Inheriton awaits. A charming mix of history, religion, and mythology combine making for the spellbinding series, Tales of the Inhabitants of Toll. Join us for the first Tales of the Inhabitants of The Colored path In the magical world of Toll, the lives of two Tillian boys, Frie and Tread, turn upside-down when they are sent on a journey far away from the comfort of home. Venturing into new territory, the boys are guided by an enchanted map to a place called Meridon. With them, they carry a stone, a whistle, and most importantly, a scroll. Colors change when Frie and Tread are joined by the well-known Prince Elias and together they encounter the threat of danger as the demented King Nail begins pursuing them across the land. As Frie and Tread move through Meridon, Samilee the Oracle travels south into Dright, accompanied by the Gilimite army, to battle the evil forces of the dark Lord Valais. The stakes heighten when the leader of their army, Lucas, becomes love-stricken by the beauty of a foreign people. Now, he must choose between two worlds, his life as an Heiron, or his newfound love. The three lands of Toll collide in this riveting tale of magic, battle, and love, as the fog of good and evil becomes an inward struggle between courage and cowardice. All parties challenge the deathly stakes in the winding roads ahead of them, facing the obstacle between doing what is easy and what is right.",
