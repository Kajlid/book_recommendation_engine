It’s been a year since an eccentric billionaire summoned seven strangers to the dilapidated, postage stamp-sized town of fat chance, texas. To win a cash bequest, each was required to spend six months in the ghost town to see if they could transform it and themselves into something extraordinary. But by the time pastry chef fernando cruz arrives, several members of the original gang have already skedaddled. Fernando’s hopes of starting a new life in fat chance are dashed when the town’s handful of ragtag residents and a mysterious low-flying plane—show him just how weird the place actually is. His hopes of making over the town’s sole cafe into a bbq restaurant for nearby ranchers threaten to turn to dust as a string of bizarre secrets are revealed.",
