  "title": "I'll Mature When I'm Dead: Dave Barry's Amazing Tales of Adulthood",
  "description": "A brilliantly funny exploration of the treacherous state of adulthood by the Pulitzer Prize-winning humorist.Some people may wonder what this subject has to do with Dave Barry, since Dave's struggled hard against growing up his entire life-but the result is one of the funniest, warmest, most pitch-perfect books ever on that mystifying territory we call \"adulthood\".In hilarious, brand-new pieces, Dave tackles everything from fatherhood, new fatherhood (\"Over the next five years, you will spend roughly 45 minutes, total, listening to songs you like, and roughly 127,000 hours to songs exploring topics such as how the horn on the bus goes* [*It 'Beep! Beep! Beep!']\"), self-image, the battle of the sexes, celebrityhood, technology, parenting styles, certain unmentionable medical procedures (\"There is absolutely no reason to be afraid of a vasectomy, except THEY CUT A HOLE IN YOUR SCROTUM.\"), and much more. It is a book of pure delight from the man one newspaper claimed \"could become the most important American humorist since Mark Twain\" (South Florida Sun-Sentinel )...though, frankly, we think they were indulging in some adult beverages at the time.
