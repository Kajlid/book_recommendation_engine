  "description": "King Englewood is dead. Logan Lassain, the Protector of Ter Chadain, has cleared the way for his sister, Teah, to claim the throne as the rightful Queen of Ter Chadain and cast out the invading Caltorian forces. But Teah cannot claim that throne. She is captive on a slave ship sailing to Caltoria with other magical slaves to have their fates decided by the evil Empress of Caltoria. With Logan in pursuit to free her, Teah must keep her identity as rightful Queen of Ter Chadain hidden until she can escape. As a slave, Teah’s magical powers are withheld from her by an ancient gemstone placed on her forehead called a “soul stone”. The clear gem darkens in color once placed upon a magical’s forehead indicating the strength of their magic. Teah’s stone darkens to a deep black marking her as the strongest magical in Caltoria since her ancestor, the first Queen of Ter Chadain. This draws unwanted attention and puts her future in great peril. Logan and his small band of rescuers must hurry. Their quest is difficult. The cost is high. New allies are found. Old friends are lost…forever. Risking death at every turn, they rush to rescue Teah. But the only way Logan can save Teah and keep Ter Chadain from falling under Caltorian rule is by not only risking death, but risking something more precious…his freedom.",
