  "title": "Battlefield Barren",
  "description": "Seargent Craig Culler is a Grand Union soldier fighting in the radioactive Barren. He fights so he and his wife can continue to live inside the walled city of Newrome as privileged citizens.  Cullerâ€™s precious piece of combat real estate is a forward outpost 100 km south of the still radioactive border between North and South Barren; the infamous wasteland that was the division line before the Great Union was formed out of what used to be Canada and the United States.  Unknown to the Union forces, the Mutes are about to begin their push through the valley on one of their biggest offensive battles ever. Culler is captured in his trench by a probe squad of the Mutes and forced to make a hard decision that could save hundreds of his fellow soldiers lives, but he may never see his wife inside the walled city again.   The \"Culler's War\" podcast is read each month and free on itunes. Each podcast contains one complete short story and the next issue picks up where the previous issue ended.  Every 5 issues it's all tied together into a novel and put on Amazon.",
