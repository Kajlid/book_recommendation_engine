  "title": "Love & Feathers: what a palm-sized parrot has taught me about life, love, and healthy self-esteem",
  "description": "When Shannon Cutts and Pearl first meet, she is still mourning the sudden passing of her first cockatiel, Jacob. The last thing she wants to do is to fall in love with another baby parrot! But one look at the tiny grey ball of fluff and Shannon just knows–he is love with wings, and they are meant to be together. A lifelong parrot lover but by no means experienced at caring for cockatiels, Shannon quickly assumes the role of eager student, with Pearl as her willing and equally eager teacher. From negotiating victuals preferences to socializing with the parrot-phobic, making home improvements to avoiding the dreaded V.E.T., Shannon learns from her feathery sidekick how to meet his basic needs, offer extra enrichment, nurture and care for him, and be nurtured and cared for in return.Pearl, in turn, opens a window for Shannon into a refreshing new world full of self-acceptance, self-respect, trust, laughter, love, and FUN. In Pearl’s world, everyone is a potential new friend, every mirror reflects prettiness, every meal is a celebration of good food and good company, and each new day is a great day to celebrate being YOU.Today, 12 years after their first meeting, Shannon and Pearl are still blissfully joined at the beak. Love & Feathers, a book based on the popular blog by the same name, is their story.",
