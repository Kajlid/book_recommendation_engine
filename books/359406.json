  "description": "A tragedy of the contemporary church is its ineffectiveness in passing on the Faith to the next generation. The children of believers too often abandon the faith of their fathers and blend into an increasingly godless society. This is happening despite a growing smorgasbord of children's programs and family ministries. Church shepherds realize that something is wrong, but are at a loss as to what to do about it. Will adding another program be the key that begins to turn things around? Tom Eldredge answers with an emphatic \"no.\" He shows how the original conflict in the Garden between God's methods and those of the enemy were repeated in the clash of the Greek (humanist) and Hebrew (biblical) worldviews, and how we continue with the same struggle today. The choice has always knowledge or relationship, which is more important? Most families, churches, and schools today choose the Greek method of raising children, when only the Hebrew method, with its emphasis on relationships, will prove effective in preserving true biblical faith over time. Eldredge offers practical and biblical hope for those dads who are willing to redirect their priorities and go safely home.",
