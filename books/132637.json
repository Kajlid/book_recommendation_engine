  "description": "EMF Health Alert is a reader friendly, easy to follow, “how to” guide, on eliminating the harmful electro-magnetic fields (EMF) from wired and wireless devices in your home and workspace to create a healthier living environment. In today’s age of digital technology, we are constantly connected through our wireless devices to a world we cannot see, hear, or touch. We rely on cellphones, computers, tablets, IPads and many other electronic devices to get us through our daily lives. However with this new technology comes something our bodies have never experienced before, information carrying radio waves (ICRW). These are artificial microwaves that allow information to be delivered from one source to another. The problem is that these man-made microwaves cause harm to our bodies at the cellular level, and as a result create many negative health symptoms like headaches, tinnitus- ringing in the ears, insomnia, lack of focus, irritability, rashes, anxiety, and heart palpitations. In this simple to follow guide, we make this information easy to understand; make the sources of radiation easy to find; and solutions easy to implement. This guide is intended for everyone, especially those who are interested in learning about the radio frequency (RF) radiation and dirty electricity that surrounds us today in our world of digital technologies.",
