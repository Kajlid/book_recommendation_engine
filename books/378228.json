  "title": "The Storyteller of Marrakesh",
  "description": "A stunning U.S. debut―a literary mystery set in the fabled city square of Marrakesh. Each year, the storyteller, Hassan, gathers listeners to the city square to share their recollections of a young, foreign couple who mysteriously disappeared years earlier. As various witnesses describe their encounters with the couple―their tales overlapping, confirming, and contradicting each other―Hassan hopes to light upon details that will explain what happened to them, and to absolve his own brother, who is in prison for their disappearance.As testimonies circle an elusive truth, the couple takes on an air as enigmatic as their fate. But is this annual storytelling ritual a genuine attempt to uncover the truth, or is it intended instead to weave an ambiguous mythology around a crime?The first in an ambitious cycle of novels set in the Islamic world, The Storyteller of Marrakesh is an elegant exploration of the nature of reality and our shifting perceptions of truth.",
