  "title": "Anne of Green Gables",
  "description": "Anne Shirley falls in love with the rambling farmhouse called Green Gables the moment she sees it. Unfortunately she is not quite what Marilla Cuthbert and her brother Matthew were expecting: they had applied to the orphanage for a boy to help on the farm, not a skinny eleven-year-old girl with a head full of romantic notions. At first Marilla is adamant that Anne should be sent back, but her heart relents when she hears about the girl's wretched life, and Matthew - though he would never interfere - is clearly already bewitched by the spirited red-head with a temper to match her hair.",
