  "description": "School is out for the summer, which will give Megan O'Reilly's friends time to see that she really starts learning something useful. When music is magic and magic is sometimes medicine, it's easy for a menehune BFF, a satyr rock star, and a disabled pixie with a service crow to give a girl information overload.  The weekend of the Fremont Solstice Fair is also the weekend of the Goblin Market. Megan's adjusted enough to this Unseelie Princess thing to see some use in all this colorful shopping potential, both real-world and magical, even if she can get ahead of herself sometimes. But someone wants to use the Market for his own destructive purposes. And he knows a guy who's great at ruining other people's Midsummer nights.",
