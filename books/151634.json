  "description": "A Charming playboy. A girl on the run from love. An exotic location where the weather isn't the only thing that's hot.  Kate Saunders is sure of only one thing as her flight to a new life lands in Dubai: short of joining a convent, her new job teaching at an all-female school is just what she needs. Until she meets Kai, that is.  Cultured and worldly, Kai lives a life of wealth and privilege where he always gets what he wants. And what he wants next is Kate. He's determined their relationship is only going one place: his bed.  The road to hell may be paved with good intentions, but it's also littered with underwear when Kate struggles to resist his sweet, filthy mouth. Talented of tongue Kai may be, but he's also not quite who he appears to be. Kate's life is about to take a turn for the complicated, leaving the one she left behind look easy.   Pretty Hot is an erotic romance, and like Dubai, it's pretty steamy. It's intended for a mature audience, one that enjoys losing itself in exotic, international locations and erotic tales. Ultimately, it's a love story. The Story of Kai and Kate.",
