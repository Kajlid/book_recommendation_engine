It doesn’t matter that he’s an alpha, he’s got no interest in dominating anywhere but on the ice.When Cartwright Johnson joins the Hell’s Flames, he expects to play hard to compensate for being an omega who dared to pursue a professional hockey career. After his last team traded him, he is not making the mistake of falling for a teammate ever again. He’s sure he’s got the control to keep his pants on and his heart closed... until he meets Keenan Avali.\n\nAn omega can't trust an alpha, much less one as hot as Avali, but nobody can fail to see they play together like they were made for it. But for how long can they be the perfect teammates on ice when they can't stand to look at each other off it?\n\n\nThis is episode 1 of “Cracking Ice”, a serialized novel that will be published every two weeks for the rest of the year.
