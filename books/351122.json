  "title": "Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Welsh Triads",
  "description": "Early Welsh literature shows a predilection for classifying names, facts, and precepts into triple groups, or triads. It has been suggested that the memorization of the various triad-sequences which have come down in the manuscripts, formed part of the professional training of the bards. Thus, \"Trioedd Ynys Prydein\", the 'Triads of the Island of Britain', served as an index to the bards' knowledge of past history and legend. It is a catalogue of the names of the traditional heroes, grouped in threes under distinguishing epithets. The present edition is the first to be based upon a full collation of all the available manuscripts, the earliest of which goes back to the thirteenth century. The text is acompanied by an English translation and notes. The introduction discusses the significance of \"Trioedd Ynys Prydein\" in the history of Welsh literature, and examines the traditional basis of the triads.",
