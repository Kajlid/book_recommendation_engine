  "description": "Sometimes funny, sometimes serious, this is a romp through life as seen through the eyes of a fisherman and traveler from childhood to retirement. Most of it is true, if you can trust the word a fisherman. Partly because it was and is my family’s penchant, and partly because of my job, I have traveled a lot. I’ve been to all but two states in this wonderful country, and I’ve managed to fish, hike or hunt in most of them. It’s been quite a journey, and one that I hope continues. So, join me, won’t you? Who knows? The fish might be biting!",
