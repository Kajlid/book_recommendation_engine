  "description": "Safety, happiness, forgiveness, and love finally surround Bria as family bonds strengthen and friendships deepen. The love that was once only a dream becomes a reality and it’s better than she ever imagined. Hers is a fairy tale come true, until the absence of those they left behind threatens the peace she desperately longs to maintain. East’s life is nothing like Bria’s and, for better or worse, never has been. Hers is a nightmare of deceit and death. Trust is questioned as alliances are made. The truth she has been seeking is found but at a cost she never meant to pay. Through it all, hope remains as the love of a father offers her a path out of the darkness.",
