The legendary Tahsis platoon, warriors thought by most to be invincible, are dispatched to investigate and are never heard from again.

As an ancient evil is unleashed upon them, a group of heroes, friend and foe alike, must band together for survival.When the true nature of their mission slowly comes to light, the growing distrust between the Kael-tii and Ashai camps threatens to tear the caravan apart. Can they set aside their differences in time to combat the menace that imperils them all, or are they doomed to join the ranks of lost souls claimed by the cursed Cowcheanne Way?",
