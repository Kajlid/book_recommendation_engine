  "description": "Alternate cover for ASIN B0042FZWZ2What happens when a writing professor and a male escort become friends? Thirty-four-year old professor Andi Cutrone has broken up with her fianc√© in Massachusetts, moved back to her native New York, and wants to be a better lover. So after meeting Devin, a handsome, charming escort, she proposes an unusual arrangement: lessons about writing in exchange for lessons about sex. When Devin accepts Andi's proposal, he draws up a contract in which the two are forbidden to see each other socially. There's just one problem: Andi also wants Devin. Faking It is a witty, sometimes hilarious, sometimes heart-wrenching story about relationships, writing, and getting real.",
