  "description": "God, she’s perfect.All I can think about is her. My obsession drawing me to her.But next thing I know she’s slipped through my fingers. But stalking my prey is what I’m good at as a hitman for hire.I’m the man she needs, whether she understands just how much she needs me…or not.Yet.I’m going to find her and convince my romance novel junkie that a heartless man from the other side of the tracks is right for her.Usually when I do a little breaking and entering it’s because I’m setting up before my would-be target arrives home, only for me to swiftly execute him.This…this is different. This is me planning for a big event in the future all right, but not one that ends in tragedy. One that ends in triumph.But will my little girl catch onto me before I tell her who I really am?I’m an all-or-nothing kind of guy, and I always find a way.I knew she was mine for life the moment I laid eyes on her, that’s exactly what she is…whether she wants it or not.",
