  "description": "Book two in the slow-burn horror romance series, Experiment in Terror, by the New York Times bestselling author of The Forbidden Man and The Pact In the for­got­ten town of Red Fox, a Navajo cou­ple is tor­tured by things unseen and by motives unknown. Wild ani­mals slink through their house in the dark, a bar­rage of stones pound their roof nightly, and muti­lated sheep car­casses are turn­ing up on their prop­erty. Armed with a cam­era and just enough to go on, Perry and Dex travel to the des­o­late locale, hop­ing to film the super­nat­ural occur­rences and add cred­i­bil­ity to their flail­ing web­cast. Only their show has a lot more work­ing against them than just grow­ing pains. Tested by dubi­ous ranch hands, a ghost from Dex’s past, and shapeshift­ing decep­tion, the ama­teur ghost hunters must learn to trust each other in order to fight the most ancient of myths…or die trying. The Experiment in Terror Series is a nine-book series that started in 2011. They must be read in order, including the four novellas. There is crude language in all books, and as the series goes on, graphic sex scenes, as well as scenes of horror and gore. Sensitive readers are advised.",
