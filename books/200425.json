  "description": "Life is too short not to embrace each day to the fullest. And that’s exactly what I intend to do. My parents paid for me to take part in a post-grad singles cruise to the Caribbean hoping I'd find a fine, Greek husband. Instead, I hooked up with the hottest guy I’ve ever met. Pasha might not be Greek, but he’s got fun written all over his rock-hard abs. We agreed we would walk away with no regrets when the ship docks. Yet as that day nears, we both realize there is something far deeper than lust brewing between us. Will the real world destroy the fantasy of our vacation fling? Or can romance forged under swaying palm trees withstand the icy chill of reality? This is a New Edition of a previously published book.",
