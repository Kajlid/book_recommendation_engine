  "description": "India. The land of the Maharajas, spicy food and Holy cows. A country known for its open sewers, extreme poverty and crazy drivers. What kind of person would want to go there on holiday? Somebody who wanted to eat a curry in its homeland. Brave the crowded streets of Delhi. Sleep in a tent in the desert. Walk barefoot in a temple inhabited by hundreds of rats. Somebody like Karen. So she booked herself and her bemused husband on a tour with a small adventure travel company and did all of these things and more. India was a wild, exciting, dirty, frustrating country. Is she pleased she went? And, perhaps more importantly, would she ever go back? Grab a cup of chai tea and a pakora or two, settle back in your favorite chair and find out for yourself as you read about her adventures in Tall Travel India. Delhi, Agra, Rajasthan and Rats.",
