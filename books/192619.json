One member has gone rogue, and another is missing and wanted by the police. On top of that, Summer’s parents are pressuring her to choose a future that doesn’t include the music world she loves so much. She’s torn between wanting to stay with Dangerheart and her soulmate Caleb, and taking off in a different direction at her dream college.Meanwhile, Summer and Caleb are closer than ever to finally unlocking the mystery of Eli White’s lost songs, but the last clues present an impossible challenge: can they outwit Candy Shell records, stay one step ahead of the police, and find a way to get to London before it’s too late? And if they can get there, will they be ready for what they may find? Summer’s dreams of the future, Dangerheart’s chances of becoming the band they’ve always dreamed of being: it all comes down to these next five days. Summer knows this would be the riskiest thing she’s ever done, that her relationship with her parents may never recover, but she also knows that this might be her last shot at figuring out what her heart really wants.Packed with mystery and music, Kevin Emerson’s final volume in the Exile series is the pitch-perfect ending to Summer’s journey of self-discovery and love, and an ode to music fans everywhere.",
