  "description": "Tanzy Hightower is not crazy. At least that’s what she tells herself. She also tells herself that the shadows in the woods aren’t living, murderous beings. Only one of these things can be true. On the third anniversary of her father’s death, Tanzy revisits the woods and the shadows that took him. She quickly realizes they now have their sights set on her. Neither Tanzy nor life as she knows it escapes them unchanged.  Two strangers seem too willing to help her navigate her new reality: Vanessa Andrews, a doctor’s trophy wife with a southern drawl and a history Tanzy can appreciate, and Lucas, a quiet, scarred man with timing that borders on either perfect or suspect. But Tanzy has secrets of her own. Desperate for answers and revenge, Tanzy must put her faith in their hands as her past comes calling, and the shadows close in.  Will her choices shed light on the shadows of her past, or will they bring forth the darkness within her?",
