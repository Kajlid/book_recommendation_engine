The stories, dating from the French and Indian War through the 1850s, recount desperate situations from the lives of westward-bound settlers, including encounters with the Native Americans they ultimately displaced.In keeping with its dramatic tone, this book was originally titled Daring and Heroic Deeds of American Women, Comprising Thrilling Examples of Courage, Fortitude, Devotedness, and Self-Sacrifice, Among the Pioneer Mothers of the Western County . Chapters include \"The War-Woman Creek,\" \"A Heroine without a Name,\" \"The Captivity of Jane Brown and Her Family,\" \"Wonderful Fortitude of Female Emigrants,\" and many other stirring tales. This new edition features five engravings from the original publication.",
