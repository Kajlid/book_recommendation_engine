  "description": "When trouble strolls in, common sense walks out.After a lifetime of rejection by those he loved, Gary returned to the one place that once made him happy and resigned himself to a life alone. Opening his bar--aptly named 'Trouble'--was his way of building a future and reminding himself what he needed to stay away from. So when Trouble--AKA Brock--walks into his bar one night, he's determined to keep his distance. No good could come from falling for Brock's adorable smile and handsome face. Except Brock seems just as determined to win Gary over as Gary is to stay away. And when Gary realizes Brock may be the real deal, he must choose between protecting his heart or taking the ultimate chance on love.",
