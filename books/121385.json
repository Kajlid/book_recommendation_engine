  "description": "The Anatomy of a Breakup...Twenty-three-year-old self-proclaimed nice Girl Monica Tanseco is finding out the hard way that in order to survive a breakup, you have to grow up - fast. Sure, breaking up is hard to do, but who knew it involved: - Denial, followed by desperate bid to get back together involving promises to do everything to make him happy - Sever loss of sleep, appetite and self-esteem - Acute paralysis - or maybe death - of good judgment - Compulsive tendencies to document every event, feeling and fantasy in a manner of reporter trying to make sense of things - More compulsive tendencies to over-examine relationship carcass and over-analyze cause of death as couple - Getting a lifeWhen her perfect boyfriend - college hoop star certified hottie and young hotshot eagle Itos Ongpauco - decided to call it quits, Monica, barista by day and dreamer by night, found herseld stepping out from behind the coffee counter and out of her comfort zone - into the mad world of magazine publishing.While starting out at the bottom of the food chain as the overworked, unpaid intern at \"M\" magazine can obliterate any trace of self-esteem, anything - including bitchy bosses, temperamental photographers, rather dull but oh-so-hot male models - is a welcome balm to her pains. Never mind that her freebie-obsessed boss treats her like an on-call, 24-hour proxy service. Never mind, that, sometimes, when she's had too much alcohol, male models become irresistible. Never mind that, despite having just had her heart broken, the possibility of love presents itself again.",
