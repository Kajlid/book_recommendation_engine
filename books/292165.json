  "description": "Losing a parent at the age of seventeen will upend anyone’s world. After her mother's death, Tessa, known for being a bad girl with a killer body, tries to right hers.  Third, her bad girl persona serves as an outlet to help her laugh off conflicting feelings about her porn star looks. But Dane isn't a bad boy, and he's the one she wants. Dane relishes Tessa’s beauty, but, it’s her actions as a caregiver to her siblings that he admires the most and they fall easily into a steamy relationship. But easy isn't in Tessa’s future. Dane's mother is her therapist and knows her secrets. Secrets that threaten to blow up her relationship with Dane if his mother decides it’s worth risking her career to keep her son out of Tessa's life.Comps for Out of Control: The main character is similar to Tim from The Boy Most Likely To, a rebel with a big heart but a caretaker when needed. Like the book I’ll Be Yours, my story describes a teen convinced she doesn’t deserve the love of the boy with a golden personality.",
