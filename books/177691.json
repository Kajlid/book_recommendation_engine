  "description": "*Disclaimer from Author - \"If being a Christian or loving Israel offends you then don't read this book, for everyone else, please enjoy!\" After one of the Holy Land's most sacred monuments is destroyed, the Ministry has to turn to their most prolific investigator to solve the case--Vince Ramsey. He soon discovers that they are facing a graver threat than any of them could've imagined. It seems the enemy's primary objective is to abolish the remains of biblical prophets--and wipe out their very existence from history. With all-out war on the brink in the Middle East, Ramsey must stop the person responsible before he strikes again. Following clues through an ancient landscape rich with peril and religious undertones, he eventually is led to a remote desert inside Jordan where Deuteronomy 34:6 states: \"God buried Moses . . . but no man knows of his sepulcher unto this day.\" Backed by a foreign superpower--the enemy has every intention of uncovering the elusive burial place. But can Ramsey prevent another horrific travesty with worldwide repercussions from happening . . . or will the villain accomplish his final blasphemous act?",
