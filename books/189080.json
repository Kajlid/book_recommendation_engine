  "title": "Project Mastodon and Other Journeys To and From Prehistory",
  "description": "Dinosaurs so charge the imagination that authors have been trying to devise ways for protagonists to encounter them since they were first described. Perhaps no other plot device has been more popular than time travel. In this collection, the reader will find eight short stories and one entire novel where time is warped, bent, cut, spilled, and opened. Humans are sent back; prehistoric animals are flung forward; mayhem, adventure, tragedy, and self-discovery ensue. Featuring works by Clifford D. Simak, Robert Moore Williams, J. Leslie Mitchell, and others, all newly illustrated.",
