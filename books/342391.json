  "description": "Ryson Acumen finds that his time of service to the people of Uton is not yet complete. Together with Holli Brances and Lief Woodson, they must work together once more to end a growing threat and to meet their own undeniable destinies. Their cause is not without loss or sacrifice as they struggle to battle grotesque forces of malevolence. Under the conniving guidance of the serp Sazar, legions of dark creatures rise out of Dark Spruce Forest and the serp turns his lustful eyes eastward. Targeting the outposts and farmlands surrounding Connel, Sazar forms a dark army to conquer the human city.Even as Ryson and his elf friends struggle against such foes, they look to the powerful wizard Enin for aid, but the spell caster remains withdrawn from nearly every clash. It is within him to decimate the entire horde, but the consequences of such intended actions trouble Enin's very soul. An understanding of balance has taught the wizard more than caution; it has led him to the presence of a being of equal power, but a creature with intentions of malice. Enin's unwillingness to interfere in the choices of individuals is born of the belief that he must allow all those around him to seek their own path as well as their own ultimate fate.",
