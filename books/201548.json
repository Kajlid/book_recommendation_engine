  "description": "Kidnapped, abandoned, and betrayed.At least no one’s asking her to spin straw into gold…Elaine was happy with her quiet, simple life. But after the death of her parents, the disappearance of her fiancé, and a traumatic kidnapping, quiet and simple are out of the question.Her father left debts, and now his creditors mean to collect. Elaine’s only asset is her brilliant artistic talent, but no genius could be equal to the impossible task demanded of her by the man with ultimate power over her future and all that she loves.Held captive by his secret obsession, Elaine discovers a fragile new love in the midst of darkness, and sets out to prove that art can be a powerful weapon, even against tragedy and despair.A darkly romantic retelling of Rumpelstiltskin, Goldheart is the second book of the Andari Chronicles, a series of interconnected but stand-alone fairy tale retellings that feature strong heroines, romance, mystery, and deeply satisfying happily ever afters.",
