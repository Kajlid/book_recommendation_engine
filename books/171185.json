A ruthless tabloid journalist and the ex-wife of Kat’s discarded lover, Trudy is out for revenge.  She is also interested in exposing—and humiliating—Kat’s mother Iris, who is secretly the international bestselling romance writer Krystalle Storm. \nAs the body count begins to build, Kat becomes inextricably embroiled in the ensuing scandal. Is the minister’s death the result of a local vendetta, or could it be connected to her mother’s unusual past?",
