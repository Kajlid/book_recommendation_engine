  "title": "Rainbows and Banana Peels: Surviving Life's Knocks with Grace",
  "description": "This book is for those that would like to live in joy and peace, are facing a banana peel field (illness, loss of a loved one, money problems, or a failing relationship), are serious about changing their life, or need to figure out how to be positive instead of negative. Part memoir and part self-help, this guide draws inspiration from the authorâ€™s cancer survival story, which is told in an inimitable and straight-talking way, and her GAAB (Going Above And Beyond) Life 21-Day Challenge. The rainbow is at the end of the journey that begins today.",
