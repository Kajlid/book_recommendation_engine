  "description": "It should be an easy rule to follow - don't bang your boss...But I didn't know who he was when I met him.And the first time I saw him, our connection sounded like the stuff of romantic legends -- that whole \"their eyes locked across a crowded room\" moment that turned into more.I didn’t believe it. . . . until it happened to me.Fine, the charming, clever, sexy-as-sin guy in the tailored suit was only trying to buy the same Snoopy lunchbox (as a gift!), but still, our eyes totally locked, and my lady parts definitely tingled as we vied for the prize.Naturally, I did what any badass business woman would do. Negotiated for the lunchbox, then found my what-if guy online and made plans to see him the next night.One night only -- that was the deal we made.But one fantastic night had us both changing our minds in the morning. And making plans for another.Until I walked into the office to learn he just bought my company.And here’s the biggest rule of romantic legends -- no matter what, don’t bang your boss. Especially if you’re already falling for him.",
