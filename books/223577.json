  "description": "Office romances can be tricky, but two hot men can mean double the fun!  Ever since Jen started her new job, she’s been dreaming about her sexy coworker Kade. He’s a distraction during the day, and fuel for her after hours fantasies. She’s been burned by an office romance before, so this time Kade’s going to stay a fantasy only.  But when Kade confesses his feelings for her, Jen can’t resist him. He’s not exactly what he seems to be, and when he leaves her behind, she tries to move on quickly. Sexy Dex seems like a stable, upfront guy, but it turns out there’s also more to him than meets the eye.  Jen’s world gets shaken up in ways she couldn’t have imagined when Dex confesses something to her that no-one else knows about. He wants to help her get over her fears of having her heart broken again, but now she doesn’t know who she can really trust.  This is a short, standalone mmf bisexual romance without a cliffhanger, previously published as a shorter story.  *****Limited time bonus: this edition includes a second short story, A Summer Dream, as a holiday gift to my readers. *****     After Hours is a hot mmf bisexual romance, perfect for fans of Elle Everton and Nicole Stewart.",
