I finally decided that it's better to just have a good time and no one gets hurt. That philosophy worked for my last two years of college. Then I let myself get pulled in again by a pair of broad shoulders, pretty hazel eyes, and kisses that turned my brain to mush. Of course he was lying to me. All my friends told me something wasn't right, but I'm such a fool.When it all went wrong, I didn't expect his tall, dark, and handsome roommate being there to catch me. I think I love him. But can I trust him? He makes me happy. Can I trust myself?Ashley graduated from college and isn’t looking for romance. What she needs is a job and the career she’s worked so hard to achieve. Can her dream of working overseas survive a man who seeks to capture her heart?Warning: The characters in this book are sex-positive feminists.",
