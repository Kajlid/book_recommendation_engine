  "description": "In this remarkable collection of talks, excerpted from her 1985-86 international tour, Swami Chidvilasananda weaves the wisdom of the Indian scriptures together with anecdotes from contemporary life. In her inimitable style, she renders ancient teachings completely relevant through a blend of humor, compassion, and clarity. We are given glimpses throughout into the master's own spiritual process, offered to illustrate typical stumbling blocks while inspiring the seeker to persevere on the path. For this revised one volume edition, twenty one of the original thirty talks have been selected, and a few of the chapters have been retitled to maintain their harmony with the new thematic arrangement.",
