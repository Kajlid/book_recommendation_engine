  "description": "When three guys in Armani suits (seriously, who robs a museum in designer wear?) try stealing a priceless statue from Julie Sparks' workplace, she expects security to handle it. She doesn't expect the statue to handle it himself by bursting apart to reveal a gorgeous, definitely-not-marble teenage guy named Michael. And she really doesn't expect him to have silver eyes, supernatural powers, and an ex-girlfriend whose idea of \"moving on\" involves potentially ending the world. Talk about relationship baggage.Now completely reimagined with 33,000 new words, this second edition of \"Bending Nature\" follows Julie as she juggles AP Chemistry (hard) with uncovering a supernatural conspiracy (somehow harder?). Between her new abilities, a devastatingly beautiful immortal who keeps climbing through her bedroom window (rude, there's a front door), and a plot that threatens everything she loves, Julie's senior year is about to get way more complicated than trying to explain to her guidance counselor why \"preventing the apocalypse\" isn't a valid extracurricular activity.\"Set some time aside because you won't be able to put this one down.\"",
