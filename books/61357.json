  "title": "How I Met the Man of My Dreams: a guide to MANifesting yours",
  "description": "Whether you’re new to the woo-woo, or a veteran looking for a breakthrough, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a more practical, fresh (or fresh-mouthed) look at the MANifestation process. So much more than the metaphysical mechanics of rustlin’ up a mate, it’s about who you become in the undertaking. Oh, and of course, there’s a juicy love story to prime your imagination. Ladies, prepare to laugh, to take an honest look within, and best of all, to be taken off the market!",
