  "description": "SHE THINKS SHE KNOWS ABOUT LOVE. HE VOWS TO TEACH HER ABOUT DESIRE. After six years at a Philadelphia finishing school, former tomboy Emma Malloy is coming home to Whisper Valley, Montana, as a sophisticated lady. Little does she know that the decades-old feud between the Malloys and the Garrettsons has escalated into a full-scale range war. Nor does she expect that her archenemy, Tucker Garrettson, whose stolen kiss she still can’t forget, has become a rugged, handsomer-than-sin cowboy who wants to hang her father and take her prisoner—in his arms.She is proud, beautiful, and bossy. And even though Emma is a Malloy, Tucker wants her badly. Here they are, caught in a blood feud, and all he wants to do is take her once and get her out of his mind. No man can outgun him, but can this infuriating beauty make him surrender his freedom and believe in love?",
