  "title": "Visible Saints: The History of a Puritan Idea",
  "description": "2013 Reprint of 1963 Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. While Morgan's literary portfolio shows remarkable diversity, it is studded with works on Puritanism. \"Visible Saints\" further solidifies his reputation as a leading authority on this subject. An expanded version of his Anson G. Phelps Lectures of 1962 (presented at New York University), this slender volume focuses on the central issue of church membership. Morgan posits and develops a revisionary main thesis: the practice of basing membership upon a declaration of experiencing saving grace, or \"conversion,\" was first put into effect not in England, Holland, or Plymouth, as is commonly related, but in Massachusetts Bay Colony by non-separating Puritans. Characterized by stylistic grace and exegetic finesse, \"Visible Saints\" is another scholarly milestone in the \"Millerian Age\" of Puritan historiography.",
