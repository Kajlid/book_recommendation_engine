  "description": "For everyone who fell in love with tomboyish Jo and the other unforgettable March girls of Little Women, Little Men offers the wonderful experience of seeing beloved characters grow up and begin new adventures. At Plumfield, an extraordinary school, Jo and her warm, wise husband, Professor Bhaer, bring love and a delightfully different education to a group of irrepressible children. Here is the heartwarming story of the ragged orphan Nat, the spoiled Stuffy, and finally naughty Nan, the strong-willed girl who dreams of becoming a doctor. Together with all the other lively inhabitants of Plumfield, these are children who come to life with a vitality and realism that have captivated generations of readers. The moving tale begun in Little Women is brought full circle Little Men-an enduring, ever-enchanting American classic of children's literature.",
