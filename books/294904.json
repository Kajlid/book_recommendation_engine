  "description": "Judge  I moved into one of the rental houses owned by the club while my own house was being built. I wasn’t happy about it, but I was too old to move back in with my mother, even for just a few weeks. It was a nice, quiet neighborhood. Until the girl next door moved in and turned my world upside down before I even knew who she was.  River  I had the worst luck. With three months left on my nursing contract, they sent me to the one place I swore I’d never return—my hometown of Devil Springs. I didn’t have a childhood full of happy memories to return to. I had a drug-addicted mother and an a**hole brother. But it was just for three months. What could possibly happen?  Adult Content Warning: This book is intended for readers 18 years and older.
