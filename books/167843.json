  "title": "Not Our Kind: Tales of (Not) Belonging",
  "description": "When you talk about outsiders, it's easy to think about that sense of isolation when you're not one of the \"popular kids\" in high school, when you're the new person on the job, when you stand out in a bad way.But there's more than that. There's the sense of wonder at a new, alien place. There's seeing everything you know through a new, different point of view. These stories defy expectations and easy genre boundaries. But if you want that sense of wonder and amazement when you first encountered speculative fiction, that idea that there is something different, something *more* just around the corner, just out of sight, that sense of coming home to the unfamiliar, then this is the book you want to read.",
