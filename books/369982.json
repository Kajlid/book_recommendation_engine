  "description": "Both G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero and the Transformers have been loved by millions across the world for years. This story begs to ask WHAT IF the Transformers, living alien robots from another world, fell into the hands of COBRA, a small, quickly growing organization bent on world domination? When Cobra launches its first attack on U.S. soil, armed with tanks, jets and vehicles that transform into giant robots, it's too much for the regular armed forces to handle, and G.I. Joe is formed to stop them. Freeing the heroic Optimus Prime from Cobra's control is our world's only hope.",
