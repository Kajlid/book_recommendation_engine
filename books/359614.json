  "description": "At last it's Christmas Eve! You're hanging the last ornament on the tree when you suddenly fall off the ladder and hit your head. When you open your eyes, you're in a strange, old-fashioned room. It's still Christmas Eve—but now you're in London, and it's the year 1842! What should you do?  If you try to get back to your own time before you miss Christmas, turn to page 12. If you decide to stay and see what an old-fashioned Christmas is like, turn to page 15. Be careful! Christmas Eve has a magic all its own!  On this strange night, you might see one of the first Christmas trees ever. Or you might be turned into a Christmas-tree ornament yourself! Some of your adventures will be scary, some of them will be exciting—but all of them will be merry!",
