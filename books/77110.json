  "description": "Only Rita Mae Brown, author of Rubyfruit Jungle , could have written a novel as passionately delightful as Southern Discomfort .  Here is a witty, warm and pentrating tale of two decades in Montgomery Alabama—a world where all is not what it seems.  Meet Hortensia Reedmuller Banastre, a beautiful woman entrenched on old money, white magnolia and a loveless marriage—until she meets an utterly gorgeous young prizefighter.  Amid such memorable characters as Banana Mae Parker and Blue Rhonda Latrec (two first-class whores) and Reverend Linton Ray (who wears his clerical collar too tightly for anyone's good), Hortensia struggles to survive the hurricane of emotions caused by her scandalous love.  How she ultimately triumphs is a touching and beautiful human drama—an intense and exuberant affair of the heart.",
