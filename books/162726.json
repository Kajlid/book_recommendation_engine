  "description": "Long before Mason left Willow Bend, Ryan met his mate and brought her home...this is the prequel to the Wolves of Willow Bend and the story of Ryan and Tiffany.   Ryan Huston serves the pack in all their public financial dealings. Connected politically and personally, he possesses a unique ability to segue into and out of human life. He’s never been afraid to use his animal’s dominance to his advantage and, though he and Toman—the Alpha of Willow Bend—are often at odds, his loyalty to the pack has never truly been tested. Not until he meets Tiffany.  Tiffany Anderson grew up hard in a world defined by its uncertainties. Meeting Giles Taglioni seemed like a happy accident turned fairy tale. Five years into the abusive marriage, Tiffany wants out. Tiffany knows Taglioni will never let go of his daughter—he’d kill her before he lets her take Alexis away from him. A desperate woman with no options until a chance encounter changes everything.  Ryan is like no one Tiffany’s ever met, but she doesn’t dare believe him when he offers to help her. Long ago made familiar with the monsters in the dark, she doesn’t dream of princes on white horses sweeping her away. She also never imagined a big, bad wolf was exactly what she needed.",
