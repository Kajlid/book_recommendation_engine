  "description": "Acclaimed author Laura Moriarty returns with a novel of complex moral dilemma, filled with nuanced characters and a page-turning plot that makes readers ask themselves, \"What would I do?\"With the publication of her first novel, The Center of Everything, Laura Moriarty was praised for her keen insights into the human condition, the wisdom of her characters, and her poignant and clear-sighted prose. With The Rest of Her Life, Moriartyâ€™s reputation as a novelist to watch is cemented, as she delivers a luminous, provocative, and ultimately redemptive look at how even mothers and daughters with the best intentions can be blind to the harm they do to one another.",
