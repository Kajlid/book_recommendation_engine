  "description": "A seriously funny, coming of age novel by Meenakshi Reddy Madhavan. Seventeen-year-old Layla knows that journal writing is way retro but thinks, why not recreate the whole blog thing in a notebook? Layla’s journal entries often morph into quirky lists that record her observations on her life and times. Light, confessional and brimming with witty teenage angst, Layla’s observations on her family and friends provide a commentary on the lives of urban teenagers and the way they think and function.",
