  "description": "The war’s almost finished – better make the most of what’s left GRINNING CAMP is a fast-moving and suspenseful comic romp about greed and skulduggery in the closing days of World War Two. Meet Emilio Crabbe, a reckless Anglo-Italian aristocrat with plenty of wit and sophistication and not an honest bone in his body. He’s a natural candidate for prison – or working in British Intelligence. The latter send him on an undercover mission in a POW camp in the south of England. Disguised as an Italian pilot, he’s assigned to crack a fantastic plot among the diehard German captives. Just don’t tell anyone that he also has a little hush-hush errand to run for New York mobster Giuseppe ‘Joe Balls’ Balzoni while he’s behind the barbed wire. Crabbe’s own version of the story – as remembered at age one hundred and five – is a mischievous confession full of surprises and humour, as much bubbly fun as chilled prosecco in an old-fashioned English pint glass.",
