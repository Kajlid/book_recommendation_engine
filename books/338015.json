  "description": "I've spent my life hunting down feral shifters and now I'm one of them. And it couldn't have come at a worse time. The director of the AFA—the Anti-Feral Agency—is retiring and I'm the top candidate to replace him. It's all I've ever wanted, but my damn grizzly bear keeps getting in the way. Snarling, growling, charging for the surface. He wants our mate badly, but I'm too busy trying to secure the coveted position to do anything about it. I didn't realize he was so close to turning. I didn't realize he was so close to the edge. But now, he's on the brink of turning feral and there's nothing I can do to stop it. I'm losing all control over him. Instead of calling me boss, the entire agency will be hunting me down. I need a mate quickly. But where the hell is she?",
