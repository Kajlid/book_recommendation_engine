  "description": "I'm Cisco Suarez and this is the end of the line.  I've been beaten, shackled, killed once or twice, but hey, who's counting? I put my foot down at being lit up like a candle at my daughter's tenth birthday party. Some things you take personal.  Revenge won't be easy. The Miami voodoo underground turned on me. An uppity wizard cartel is creeping into my business. If that's not enough, I keep seeing the same damn black cat everywhere I go. Talk about crummy luck.  None of it matters. I've got laser focus on my archenemy, a jinn with a knack for fire. News flash: I'm done being burned. Connor Hatch is going down for good, even if I have to drag him to hell myself.",
