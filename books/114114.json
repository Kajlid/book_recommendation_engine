  "description": "K9 Police and Army Dogs from New York to Berlin Dogs have much to teach us humans about selflessness, loyalty and incorruptibility. As crime-fighters aiding the police, Special Forces dogs, in particular, heed the call of duty with all the courage that their owners and fellow officers have. Author Violetta Kovacs presents 12 true and touching stories of these brave, tough, smart and beautiful animals in her latest book, K9 Police and Army Dogs from New York to Berlin. Kovacs gives a voice to those brave and honorable officers of the K9 variety who cannot speak for themselves. Her tales of their exploits demonstrate what extraordinary creatures they are. For thousands of years, man and his four-legged \"best friend\" have had a special bond. As guide dogs for the blind, search-and-rescue dogs for the lost, sheep dogs for shepherds or simply companions for ordinary people, dogs have always taken their place at their masters' sides. This bond is no more apparent than with the Special Forces K9 officers Kovacs honors with K9 Commando. The touching stories in the book prove without a doubt that a dog is not \"just an animal.\" It testifies to the truly deep and honest emotional relationship between a police officer and his dog.",
