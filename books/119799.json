  "description": "The days are juicy and sweet, but beware the seeds in a watermelon summer!Forsythia's bedtime stories as a child centered around the intentional community where she'd been conceived and which her mother had abandoned soon after her birth. So even though she was more familiar with subways than with milk cows, Forsythia knew she couldn't let the farm be sold sight unseen. She threw away her pre-college European adventure and resolved to be the catalyst bringing the ailing community back to life.Getting from the airport in no-bus-service West Virginia to the Kentucky commune where her mother once lived turned out to be the easy part of Forsythia's adventure. Harder was searching for an elusive father who felt cryptic notes and a library card were sufficient stand-ins for his presence. The piercing blue eyes of a perfect boy further complicated matters, making it difficult to hold onto her own ambitious plans for the future.Add in a rustic farmhouse, a flooded creek, and an unexpected betrayal, and the deck seemed to be stacked against Forsythia. But she couldn't give up because if the intentional community disintegrated, Forsythia would never really understand what she'd been missing.And she'd never meet her bio-dad.",
