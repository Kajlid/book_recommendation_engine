  "description": "Emery St. James never dreamed of being a contestant in one of those dramatic baking contests. But then her life turned into a reality show of epic proportions.Owning a bakery was her childhood dream – and the pompous rich boy who opens a French pastry café right down the street, her worst nightmare. The last thing she needs as she struggles to make ends meet is competition. Even more annoyingly, competition by the name of Marshall Bartlett, who has the nerve to steal her parking spot and insult her bakery. But putting Marshall out of her mind isn’t a piece of cake. Not when both families attempt to broker peace by blackmailing them into five “get to know you” dates, and especially not when Emery’s sex-starved grandmother is chaperoning from afar.Will their dates go down as easily as Emery’s cherry cobbler, or will they be a recipe for disaster?",
