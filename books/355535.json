  "description": "Award-winning Poet of the Year, Margaret Havill \"Mandi\" Reid, is represented by a rich assortment of verse in \"Love & City Dreaming\". While the focus remains firmly on her love poetry and urban verses, this anthology also includes limericks and other humorous offerings, religious and political themes, philosophic conundrums and even some children's verse. In fact, unlike her previous collection, \"Song of the Wayward Wind\", care has been taken on this occasion to make all the contents of \"Love & City Dreaming\", including Mandi's own illustrations, suitable for all readers.",
