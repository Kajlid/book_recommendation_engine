  "title": "A Special Providence",
  "description": "Robert Prentice is 18. His mother, Alice Prentice, is 53. Both are damaged souls: Robert, by war; Alice, by thwarted dreams of prosperity. In two deeply humanizing portraits, the great American writer Richard Yates crafts a novel of postwar America, at once at odds with its own sense of identity and mercilessly prohibitive to its like-minded citizens.",
