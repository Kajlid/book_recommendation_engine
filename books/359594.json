Talk about pressure I don’t need.Did I mention everyone trying to kill me?My mate.My brothers.My mother.What a clusterfluck.Add in Loki, Freya, and a host of the Norse pantheon to the mix, each one trying to manipulate me to follow their own plans, and you’ve got a recipe for chaos.What’s a girl to do?Find a new path that no one expects, and run straight into the arms of disaster.Or as some might call it….straight into the arms of Havoc.",
