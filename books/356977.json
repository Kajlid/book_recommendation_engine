Finally, he does more than just threaten.The deed done, the Reaper's threats now realized, Joel and his small band of friends find themselves alone in a dying world. Their families are all dead and gone, and Joel's family home is now their stronghold. Faith and faithlessness are investigated as his ongoing visions prepare Joel for the realization that the worst is far from over.
