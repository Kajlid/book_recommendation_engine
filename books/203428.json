Meet a different kind of American motorcycle club-part outlaw, part BDSM Master, all code and heart. Tuesday has been running on empty for years, that changes when she almost literally collides with Colt, the president of THE MASTERS M.C. A born outlaw, Colt has created something new, and Tuesday finds herself wondering if the sexy, tattooed biker is a sinner, or saint, as she rides on the back of his Harley, into a world she could never imagine. Running from a past she didn't want, one she didn't dare know, and fearing for her life. She learns NOT ALL FAMILY IS BLOOD related, and some of the deepest roots are forged in LEATHER, INK & CHROME.

The initial buds form on the family tree, and the brutal, suspenseful ride toward the birth of a new breed of biker. FEEL... As the first seeds are sown to grow the sassy, would-be debutante, into the slave Colt knows will make the bloodshed worthwhile. LEARN... Along with Tuesday, what both lifestyles are really about, on her journey to becoming...PROPERTY OF",
