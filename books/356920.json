  "title": "The Diamond Sutra: The Buddha Also Said...",
  "description": "Written more than 25 centuries ago, the Diamond Sutra is the first text to record the Buddhaâ€™s own teachings, and it remains one of the most popular. One day, after the Buddha finishes his daily walk to collect alms, a senior monk steps forth to ask how he can best help humanity. Buddha responds, and thus begins a dialogue regarding the nature of perception. Renowned spiritual teacher Osho offers his unique interpretation of the Buddha's words, writing in an easy, humorous, and conversational style that makes even the most complex ideas understandable.",
