  "description": "A bear wants to paint a picture, and so he does; however, two fine, proper gentlemen don’t think that it is a very fine picture at all. But just because they don’t see what the bear sees doesn’t make it a bad picture, right? Daniel Pinkwater turns art (and art critics) upside down in this classic tale, now beautifully reillustrated by D. B. Johnson.",
