  "title": "My Lady Taken",
  "description": "The Duke of Sutherlin's spying career is over and the time has arrived for him to marry. But Radford isn't certain he can find a hot-blooded lady like his ex-spying friends from the Archangels have.  However, never daunted, he concocts a plan to find a passionate woman to marry by betting himself in marriage on the books at White's. He is a Duke after all, therefore making him any English lady's prize and hopefully sending them in amorous pursuit of him.  What he doesn't expect is the feminine artifice of Lady Nia O'Shea when she sets her witty, seductive, and scheming sights on him. But all is not what it seems in this erotic adventure and the plot and carnal play advance into lively adventures in and out of bed. Where the duke falls in love with a woman whose face he never sees until the very end.  Fallen Angel The characters of Radford and Nia are well matched; both are well rounded, and have distinct personalities that are very appealing to the reader. The supporting cast, including the heroes and heroines from the previous installments in the series, are quite amusing in their antics. The love scenes are very explicit and sexy, and depict a man and woman in a loving relationship. I was definitely entertained by this novella, and would recommend it to my friends.",
