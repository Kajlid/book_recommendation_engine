  "description": "It’s March 2020 and Liza, her husband and two teenage children are at home in Auckland in level-four lockdown due to Covid-19. Reflections with her family around the dining table inspire Liza to reflect on another challenging time in history ― nearly forty years before ― when the South African Springbok rugby team toured New Zealand.Casting her memory back to 1981, Liza recalls her life as a fifteen-year-old, including her first love, friendships, first-hand experiences of racism, and what it means ― and what it costs ― to find your voice and use it.In Our Own Backyard is a startling, confronting portrait of a society divided. Anne Kayes has written a masterful YA novel that considers questions of human equality that are as pertinent in the twenty-first century as they were in 1981.‘Anne Kayes’ book addresses significant turning points in New Zealand history ― the 1981 Springbok rugby tour and the pandemic which impacted on us in 2020. In order to continue moving forward as a society, we must learn from these experiences.’― Helen Clark, Prime Minister of New Zealand, 1999–2008‘This impressive novel shows the 1981 Springbok Tour was not just a battle against Apartheid but one which exposed deep-seated racism within New Zealand itself. The novel reveals these issues in the interactions between its teenage characters as they navigate their relationships against a backdrop of anti-tour protests. It’s hard not to wince at the day-to-day reality of race-hatred experienced by Maori and Pasifika and their families. . . . We have begun to move in a new direction and this book helps along that path.’ ― John Minto, teacher and political activist",
