  "description": "It’s Halloween. Teen brothers, Liam and Lyle, have family over from out of state, leaving them to share a bed. Since they’re only a year apart, they’re pretty close. So close, in fact, that they touch each other in the way blood-related brothers are forbidden to do.It turns Liam on whenever twinky Lyle roleplays as a submissive girl who needs to be owned, even though Liam continually tells himself he’s straight. His brother gives him the kind of submission his girlfriends never could.Five years later, it’s Halloween again. And Lyle is back home from graduate school, ready to reconnect with Liam after drifting apart. Lyle is now so sexually experienced that he revels in being a dirty slut. He also hasn’t let go of his cross-dressing fetish as he continues to wear skirts and panties, and being a twink with a boyish face makes it more convenient to fool anyone.But no matter how many hot men Lyle can get lucky with, his heart will always belong to Liam, the real love of his life. Unfortunately, Liam has a new girlfriend, so he seems to have moved on from their naughty past.Or has he?Now that the two brothers are finally home alone, they find themselves in a familiar situation. This time, however, the sexy games they played in the past just might prove that they were an appetizer to what could be the main course.Dessert included.",
