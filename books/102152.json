  "title": "The LitClub",
  "description": "Developed by a veteran homeschooler as a means for her dyslexic daughter to complete high school English without tears, LitClub takes the fear out of teaching literature and adds pleasure to the experience by utilizing themed meals, fun projects and plenty of time to hang out with friends. You can stop there and enjoy the LitClub experience as an extra curricular activity or make use of the other tools provided in the book for a well-rounded English literature curriculum for a child of any age. There's no need to be an expert in literature to get the full benefit from LitClub. Every part of the club is mapped out for you. Part I explains the reasoning behind the structure of LitClub as well as the outcome you and your kids can expect from your LitClub. Part II describes the individual tools available to the LitClub parent/facilitator and child including detailed explanations and samples so you can design a club to suit your needs. Part III allows you to facilitate four LitClub meetings including complete, ready- made materials so that all you have to do is show up and enjoy an evening with your friends. After you finish this book, if you want more LitClub fun, then watch for the next book: LitClub, An Ancient Reading Experience, a classical book club for high school. It will include nine classic titles from the ancient times, enough LitClub experiences to last a whole school year.",
