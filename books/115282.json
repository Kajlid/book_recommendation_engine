  "description": "Jack worked hard to obtain a normal life. He might not love it, but it's better than the criminal life he left behindâ€”even if it cost literally everything, and he really does hate being a damned delivery man. On the bright side, his route includes a friendly old lady who makes the world's best cookies and regales him with tales of her hot, jet-setting son. Normalcy definitely has perks.Then he walks in on her and her son arguing with men at gunpoint.Note that this book is a free read offered by Less Than Three Press.
