  "title": "Have Not Been the Same: The CanRock Renaissance 1985-95",
  "description": "Capturing the spirit of Canadian rock from 1985 to 1995—a time when it became cool to be Canadian—this book chronicles how indie labels flourished, campus radio exploded, MuchMusic changed the way people view music, major labels tapped into the underground, and an exciting new generation of artists created a new canon of CanRock that altered the musical landscape. Bands like The Tragically Hip, Blue Rodeo, and Sloan created a fever pitch for Canadian music, but there were also numerous others in the underground who created equally exciting work. This vital, lively, and entertaining examination of a groundbreaking decade contains vivid original photographs and interviews with all the major players.",
