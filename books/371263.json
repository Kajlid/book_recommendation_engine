Twelve years ago, Marina Cranston and her lovers Kyle Gerber and Marcus Byrnam founded the community of Cranston as a youthful flight of fancy. Young and idealistic, they wanted to have a place to share their love and reside with people who understood and lived the same lifestyle. Bliss was theirs with troubles staying outside Cranston's gates. Until a year ago...
