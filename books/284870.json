  "description": "Bondage. Spanking. Hungry rabbits and crazy ex-boyfriends.    Fired from his job, by his crazy boss, wizard Bradley Ives is having a bad day. Until he is swept off his feet by Clairmont Lunar. The charming, sexy vampire who is definitely more than he seems.    Bradley might look like a dominant, strong alpha male, but just like the cotton tail rabbit familiar following him around, he's a soft bunny submissive and Clairmont promises to give Bradley the domination he's been craving.  Wild passionate nights seem great, until someone tries to kill Bradley and he's forced to learn that Clairmont is not the secretary he's posed as. In one day, Bradley has gone from an ordinary ward officer to the target of hitmen, vampire conspiracies and political games. What's a bunny to do? Bradley is no pushover and anyone coming after him had better hope they've made funeral arrangements.  A MM BDSM paranormal erotic novella.",
