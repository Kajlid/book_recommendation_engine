  "description": "LOVE and CANDY is a coming-of-age romance that doesn't shy away from the raw details of a young woman's first relationship. Overwrought and not very self-assured, she falls for a tortured, sarcastic guy who's nothing like Prince Charming.Samantha Montclare is not who she thought she was. Straitlaced and academically minded, she's knocked to her knees by an unexpected infatuation with the star of her local soccer team just as she discovers that her biological father is not the loving dad who raised her but a forbidding Italian aristocrat.Within the social hierarchy of a wealthy suburban high school, Delaney Troy is so superior to naive Samantha that she can't speak to him without provoking obscene taunts from his friends.Delaney is gorgeous, but much of Samantha's fascination stems from his brazen honesty and bristling wit. His air of confidence inspires so powerful an interest he draws her in without even looking at her.But how could she possibly date a guy like Delaney who insists he only wants to hook up -- and doesn't believe in love?Will the scandalous truth about the circumstances of her conception threaten her happy home life?Must she find a place in her life for an alarming new \"father\" just as she's becoming an independent young woman?",
