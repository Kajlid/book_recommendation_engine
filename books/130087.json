  "description": "There are always two sides to every story. If you liked Calculated, you're going to love Driven, book #2 in the Discovered series! Using a mirrored plot technique, this fast paced, page-turning story goes behind the scenes in book #1 to show everything as it happened from the antagonists point of view. The mysteries are revealed as readers discover who the true allies were, and who ultimately fell into the trap of blackmail and deception. Friends betray friends, law enforcement switches sides, and the characters begin to realize that not everything is as it originally seemed - especially Mara Winsor... Mara, who portrayed herself as a victim in the massive murder cover-up scheme in book one, reemerges in Driven as a woman bent on revenge. When everything was taken away from her at such a young age - her family, her friends, her inheritance, her faith - she began devising a plan that would avenge her circumstances and punish everyone who had a hand in destroying her life. Now in a position to see that plan come to fruition, she skillfully maneuvers all the pawns on her chessboard with twist after dark twist to feed her drive for retribution. Is Mara merely a sympathetic victim of circumstance, or truly a psychotic elitist?",
