  "title": "Mustn't Grumble",
  "description": "Written in a style familiar to his millions of listeners, rich with warmth and irony, MUSTN'T GRUMBLE is Terry's definitive autobiography. Not only does he introduce the reader to post-Emergency Ireland, his chain-smoking maiden aunts, his quick-witted mother and hard-working father and the (not so) Christian Fathers who tried to knock his hands off, he explains how he's managed to avoid a hard day's work from childhood to knighthood, and entertained a few million people along the way. Terry talks in full about his past 35 years with the his hugely popular Radio 2 show, his TV shows WOGAN (NOW & THEN) and BLANKETY BLANK, the Eurovision Song Contest, working on the BBC's Children in Need programmes, and where he learnt to breakdance so brilliantly. It is the autobiography his fans - and TOGs - have been waiting fresh, honest, a real craic and completely the same ... but different.",
