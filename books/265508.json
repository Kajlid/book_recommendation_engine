  "title": "From Naked Ape to Superspecies: A Personal Perspective on Humanity and the Global Eco-Crisis",
  "description": "Human beings have acquired enormous technological muscle power, and - coupled with our numbers and our soaring consumption - we are now having an impact on the planet that no other species has ever had. We are trying to dominate nature, but we are still part of it. Foresight has always been a key to our survival and we have never needed it more than we do now. As we look ahead to an uncertain future, we have to examine some of our most cherished notions, like the ability of science to give us the power to manage nature, the benefits and hazards of genetic engineering, the real impact of information explosion, and the need to keep the global economy growing forever. As you will hear in the programs, despite the sophistication of our technology, we remain biological beings, animals, inextricably embedded in the natural world. We must redefine progress and find ways to live in balance with each other and nature. Produced at the state of the art recording studios of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Approximate Duration 4 Hours",
