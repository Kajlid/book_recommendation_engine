  "description": "Two baby girls seating in the rear of a car are involved in a terrible accident and their mother dies. An alien spacecraft hovering in the storm above witnesses the event and teleports the girls from the burning car. The girls are taken to the alien's home world on the other side of the galaxy. On arrival, they are separated and never told they were saved from a burning vehicle on a planet on the other side of the galaxy. Twenty-six years later, they are headed to Earth on opposite sides of good and evil. However, they are not aware they are sisters, let alone earthlings. The younger sister is an agent for the alien, Captain Arantose, who wants to either conquer or destroy the Earth for its precious raw materials. The other sister's mission is to either protect Earth or let it be destroyed. The eyes of Earth can't see every inch of space and spot an intruder, with either good or bad intentions, which could sneak through and take over or destroy Earth. When these aliens arrive, can Earth survive? Will the leaders of Earth be able to negotiate and save its inhabitants? Will its inhabitants be ready to sacrifice everything or die?",
