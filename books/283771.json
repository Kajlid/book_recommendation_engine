  "description": "Warlock is the master of Satanic black magic and Indian Tantra; who has engaged for years in ritualistic abuse and human sacrifice. Bharoo Shah Bengali is a born-blind Sorcerer, who raises demonic powers to challenge the supremacy of the evil-genius and drag him to his Waterloo. No one takes prisoners in the duel-unto-death that only one amongst them can survive. Will the ghosts of the victims of the ritualistic-killer get their revenge on Warlock by claiming his sanity and life? Or will Warlock - the most evil man ever born - yet again dominate and triumph the collective might of his enemies? The war of the black-magicians has entered the valley of death and the world will hold its breath to see the outcome.",
