  "description": "Rhett Lundthal’s job to make sure shifter-human relations are running smoothly in his small town. But he’s having trouble keeping the peace now that a prank has turned his life upside down.  Someone has put his picture up on an online dating app without his permission. Now, even though he isn’t looking for a mate, human women are turning up left and right for dates. Things get even more complicated when one of the women is attacked by an out of control shifter coming to meet him.  Joseline Herza is over the moon when she matches with a tall, dark, and handsome as hell shifter on a dating app. She’d always wanted to go on a date with a shifter and now her dream is coming true. But instead of a night of fun, she’s almost killed by a shifter on her way to her date.  Some of the town shifters are nervous after the attack. If word gets out that a human was almost killed by one of them, it would be disastrous for the town. When her life is threatened, Rhett steps in to protect Joseline.  As he tries to keep Joseline from danger, the town’s shifter-human relations aren’t the only one Rhett has to worry about. Now that it’s met her, his animal won’t be letting go of the beautiful human without a fight. Rhett is going to have to make an impossible choice. Which is more important, the safety of his entire town or the beautiful human he’s falling in love with?",
