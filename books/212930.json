  "description": "Dr Gray Davis is looking for a peaceful, sun-filled holiday on a remote island, but then she meets Beau Pickford. The attraction is immediate. Unfortunately for them, Brody Douglas is also on holiday, and a stone carving he found by the river makes him sick—sick enough to kill him. But when he awakens, he’s not what he was before, and Gray and Beau find they have to fight for their lives and a way off the island.Cover Artist: Natasha SnowEditor: Cora Walker",
