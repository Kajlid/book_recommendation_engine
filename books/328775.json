  "title": "There's No Business Like International Business: Business Travel – But Not As You Know It",
  "description": "First, on a whirlwind business trip around half the countries in South America in just a fortnight, Oliver Dowson faces near-death experiences in planes and cars, meets civil insurrection face-to-face, risks kidnap and must overcome mindless bureaucracy that could derail the itinerary on a daily basis.Next, follow along as he travels around the Far East for three weeks in the company of an obstreperous, can’t-do-without but can’t-do-with female colleague, learning new cultures fast. Oh, and all in the pursuit of business goals that somehow still seem to be met along the way.These unique trips may have had a business purpose, but this is no business book or how-to guide; rather, it’s a delightful, off-beat travelogue with an off-beat much travelled narrator. There are plenty of vivid characters to meet en route, an abundance of anecdotal fun, plus an education on local cultures and cuisines to be gained.Pre-publication reviewers “Exceptionally well crafted, each page illuminated with entertainment, wit, and candour, to categorize it as simply a travelogue seems to do it a great injustice. Here, we have something of true merit.” (Thomas J Kenny), “Exciting, fun, and all-around surprising. A clear masterpiece.” (Andrea Scholar), “Oliver Dowson has created something I never thought a nonfiction book about business trips that is actually fun and engaging to read.” (Brandon Diehl)",
