Everyone’s awed by his Scotland Yard successes—but they don’t know about his secret weapon. No matter how messy the murder or how dirty the deed, Mrs. Jeffries’ polished detection skills are up to the task…proving that behind every great man there’s a woman—and that a crimesolver’s work is never done.",
