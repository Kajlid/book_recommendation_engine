  "description": "Surviving the fiercest combat in Flanders, a head wound in the final and least known battle front of World War I, along Italy's Piave River, and the threat of a firing squad for desertion, a teenage Corporal from The Queen's Own West Kent Regiment forges a new family and future, only to find he must risk everything again, this time for love.As exciting and well written as it is impeccably researched. It’s as outstanding in its depiction of trench warfare as it is dealing with the loves and losses of its protagonist, Reg. -- Marge PiercyFascinating, gripping, amazing! It’s so wonderful. It's beautifully written and heart wrenching. I just love this book. -- Maria Mazziotti Gillan (American Book Award winner)",
