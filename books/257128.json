  "description": "They say what doesn't kill you makes you strongerâ€”if that's the case, I better be badass by the time this is over.After two years at a dead-end job, Rebecca Peterson finally walks away from everything she knows to follow her dreams in Ireland. Instead of dreams, the dreary streets of Belfast rekindle her terrifying nightmares, and this time they aren't confined to her imagination. Twisted and vicious, Faeries are being unleashed on Earth to prey upon humans, who are unaware of the vile creatures walking among them. Becca must stay alive long enough to learn why she can see what others can't, and even more importantly, discover how to keep the Fae from destroying life on Earth. Delving into the underbelly of the city, Becca discovers that she is not entirely alone in her abilities; however, centuries of secrecy makes gathering information a challenge. When Becca crosses paths with two mysterious strangers, her life is only complicated further. The gorgeous but brooding Lochlan demands complete honesty but refuses to provide any answers of his own. On the other hand, Ronan is enigmatic and charming, and with his sights set on making Becca his, he offers more help than most. But Becca quickly learns that trusting others is difficult when you have secrets of your own. Sometimes, the enemy is within....Warning: This is NOT a Young Adult book! It contains graphic violence and scenes with adult sexual situations. Shadow Play is the first book in a duet and it is highly recommended that both books are read in the proper order as the duet is one story.",
