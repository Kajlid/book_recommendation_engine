  "title": "The Power of a PrayingÂ® Woman Book of Prayers",
  "description": "Bestselling author Stormie Omartian presents her most-loved prayers in four compact editions. Small enough to keep in purse or pocket for quick conversations with God, lovely enough to give as a special gift to encourage and draw the hearts of friends and loved ones to the Lord in prayer, these books will help unlock the power of praying. More than a \"how to get what I want in prayer\" kind of book, this sweet gathering of prayers from a woman's heart will help readers seek the Father and be transformed in the process. At His feet is the answer to a woman's every need; in His hands is hope and joy for her life.",
