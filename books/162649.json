  "description": "Final and edited description to come... ElijahI kill people for a living, but I’m really not a bad guy. At least I don’t think so. I’m just taking out the trash, the fact I get paid to do it is a happy coincidence. A guy has to make a living, right? Gotta put food on the table, pay the mortgage and all that, you know? Normally I’m a pretty unemotional person – I fear nothing and no one. I get things done without regret or ever looking back. But like Superman, I have my own form of kryptonite and her name is Sidney Lopez. She looks at me, but she never really sees me. I know everything about her, but she knows nothing about me. She dominates my thoughts, but I know I’m just one of millions of people who adore her. I won’t lie, I’m obsessed. I won’t stop, can’t stop, until she’s mine.",
