  "description": "Why is the Indian state so petrified of an 80-year old Jesuit called Stan Swamy – so much that they sent police, twice, all the way from Pune to raid his room and confiscate his bare belongings? First, the central BJP government, acting with the Pune police, tried to implicate him in the Bhima-Koregaon case which, is clear to any thinking person, is a trumped-up effort to silence a well-known human rights activist. In 2018, the BJP government in Jharkhand, filed an FIR against Stan and others for a Facebook post. A year and a half later, they tried to arrest him, and also claimed that he was absconding, when of course he was doing no such thing.The government is scared because Stan has courage and is not scared to raise his voice against injustice wherever he sees it in any form. And, of all the issues that has affected Adivasi India in the last decade or so, it is the ‘mass jailing of people’, allegedly for supporting Maoists. As Stan points out, when an entire young generation is in jail, the impact on society is devastating.\"Why truth has become so bitter, dissent so intolerable, justice so out of reach?’ Because truth has become very bitter to those in power and position, dissent, so unpalatable to the ruling elite, justice, so out of reach to the powerless, marginalised, deprived people. Yet, truth must be spoken, right to dissent must be upheld, and justice must reach the doorsteps of the poor. I am not a silent spectator.\"\"This booklet is not my autobiography. It is rather a collation of some glimpses/episodes from my life that somehow made a difference for me, and possibly for my confrères, colleagues and the people with whom I have shared my life.\"",
