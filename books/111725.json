Shane Martin has traded in late nights and fast women for midnight feedings and lullabies. All is well until Kate McAlester, a prissy, stuck-up social worker, is assigned to him. Kate only sees a clueless, single dad unfit to be a parent, but Shane is determined to prove her wrong. The more he tries to impress the nosey social worker, the more volatile the situation gets and sparks fly. Shane can’t decide whether to take Kate to bed or put her over his knee. But when life takes an unexpected hit, and his world gets turned upside down, Kate proves to be more of an ally than he realized. This is not the life he wanted, but now it’s too late to go back. Shane must prove himself worthy to everyone who doubted him. He must prove he’s much more than a simple man.",
