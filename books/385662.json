  "description": "In 'Cycling Solo\", Trevelyan has found his voice, but the bike is in bits. 29 year old cyclist cartographer Trevelyan is a candid observer as well as a survivor.: camping on a budget of next to nothing while cycling alone for five months. No watch, just a compass and a blog. From Ireland to Istanbul with forgettable campsites,random kindnesses ,punctures, falls and steep kiolemtres in between, this offbeat quest with the upside down 'Relections of Blogging Bicycology' (at the back) with a home view, is worth sharing.Quest is his real middle name. Mother-son co-authors are unsuaul collaborators but at three, Trevelyan inspired the now classic picture book 'There's a Hippopotamus on our Roof Eating Cake' and recently helped with Darwin research for the novel 'Outback Ferals'.Orienteering was a family sport which meant map reading and getting lost were weekly challenges, but the family that writes and explores together, stays together.'Trail Magic: Going Walkabout for 2184 Miles on the Appalachian Trail' (Brolga) is the 2013 sequel",
