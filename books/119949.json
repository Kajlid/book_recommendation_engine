  "description": "The wire read “Similia similibus curantur Similar things cure similar things.” It was no code, no hidden message. It was sent in the plain and the deeper message it revealed had the desired effect as Katherine Pettigrew ran into the foyer of their ancestral home. She stood proud and defiant and shouted “Evil ones are on the move once again and once again it falls upon us to rein them in.” She lifted her hands to the sky and turned counter clockwise. “Smoke of air and fire and earth, cleanse and bless this home and hearth. Drive away all harm and fear; only good may enter here.” This is the beginning of the end of the Vampire pure bloods.Centuries earlier, in a last ditch effort to end the Vampire revolt, they entered into a pact with a powerful witch to summon the demon that consumed their kind, Caleb, son of Lilith, the Vampire eater. The demon did his job too well, literally decimating the vampires in the east and forcing a surrender. The solution was imprisoned by the witch and the vampire pure bloods retreated to the west and the new world. Centuries later murders and vampire signs are on the rise forcing the Brokenhearted to once again take action. Pawns or puppeteers, which are they? Are vampires really on the rise? or are they being set up? What ever you believe there is one thing that is certain, Caleb will be unleashed and vampires will surely die.",
