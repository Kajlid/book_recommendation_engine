  "description": "The perfect book for any Cocker Spaniel lover! After having several stories published in Happy Tails Books' Lost FOUND! series as well as many articles about rescue in local newspapers, Becky Corwin-Adams wrote her own Cast-Off Cocker Spaniels. This book highlights her foster and forever dogs' antics and challenges. A portion of proceeds is donated back to Cocker Spaniel rescue. Nine-year-old Rags was found roaming the streets as a stray. When she landed at the shelter, she needed six baths to free her from the oil in which she was covered. Her little rear had no fur, and the skin in that area was as tough as leather. Her issues were severe, including water-filled blisters on her feet and legs. Poor Rags was the saddest-looking Cocker I had ever seen. Her eyes were downcast and droopy, and the fur around them was gone. She certainly was not very attractive. For many long months we treated Rags with antibiotics, and we bathed her three times a week with medicated shampoo. She was a good patient, never complaining even though she had to soak in the bathtub for 10 minutes each time. Finally, our efforts paid off, and a new dog emerged. At adoption events, people commented on Rags’ beauty and her soulful face. This was progress! Now, our task was to convince some special person to look beyond her age… Does Rags find a home? Buy the book to find out!",
