  "title": "Here in Spirit: Knowing the Spirit Who Creates, Sustains, and Transforms Everything",
  "description": "“I'll be there in spirit.” We say this knowing it isn't really possible. Yet we often find ourselves dislocated from the present, inattentive to things in front of us: people, work, culture, ministry opportunities, prayer, and even the Spirit himself. The Holy Spirit, however, relocates us in the present, motivating us to fully engage whatever God puts before us. Instead of relating narrowly to the Spirit based on just a few of his gifts, this book broadens our engagement with him, touring aspects of his vast character that often go unexplored. It turns out, living here in the Spirit is the source of the most meaningful, creative, satisfying life possible.",
