Through dedication and training she quickly rose to be the best assassin in the world. But no amount of preparation could guard her heart against falling in love. Anna’s armor was severely crumpled when she met Ben Pearson, the one man that managed to get under her skin and stay there. When Katsu Vang, a powerful player in the Yakuza, became a threat to Ben, Anna did the one thing she knew best–she went into assassin mode and fought the problem at the source. Katsu Vang proved to be an admirable adversary that even Anna couldn’t take down on her own. Because of her undercover intel work, Anna became a target for Katsu. She was sold into the sex trade and continuously injected with heroin until her body was hopelessly addicted. Ben Pearson was hiding behind his own mask, which finally dropped as his true identity was revealed to Anna in HiT for Freedom. Ophelia is Ben’s right hand at the job he held as a front. Ophelia has her own vendetta and wants her mother’s killer brought to justice. Katsu has vanished but his power still poses an imminent threat to all concerned.
