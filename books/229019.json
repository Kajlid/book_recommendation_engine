She's got the look, the attitude, and a delish new boyfriend, Drew Van Allen. But she's starting to have second thoughts as to whether the \"New York\" Casey is the real Casey. And she's not so sure she likes herself much anymore. She's not the only one.Madison Macallister has always had her Manolo Blahniks firmly planted on the top rung of the social ladder-until that corn-fed cow Casey stole Drew away from her and made her look the fool. So what if Madison wasn't exactly dating Drew at the time? She wanted him. And everyone knows that Madison gets what she wants, like Drew-and a little revenge.",
