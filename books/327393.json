  "title": "The Undateable Rinn Davidson",
  "description": "Rinn is a lot of things — a big sister, an honor student, the only out lesbian at the bar — but she’s definitely not girlfriend material. At least, not until her best friend’s nemesis asks to be her fake girlfriend. Can she juggle a popular girlfriend, unending family duties, and an angry best friend, all without coming out to her mom? Probably not, but a girl’s got to try.",
