  "description": "Out of PrintSee \"Be Still My Soul\" by Joanne Bischof for the latest version.------Sometimes surviving love is as hard as surviving life... Seventeen-year-old Lonnie Sawyer, born and bred in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains, has always dreamed of her own home and family, but not this soon. Not this way. No girl wants to be forced to marry someone she doesn't love...someone she's even afraid of. But could it be any worse than life with her pa? Every girl in Rocky Knob wants to steal handsome Gideon O'Riley's heart, so it's no wonder the arrogant and talented musician believes he can get anything he wants. What he wants is Lonnie Sawyer, the pretty girl with a tender smile and sweet voice. But a fateful mistake and a tangle of lies forces him down a path he's not ready to take. Jebediah and Elsie Bennett have a good life-a beautiful home and a small farm. But each passing year reminds them that they're growing older, while the workload grows heavier. With no living children, they need a miracle. A turn-of-the-century tale that delves deep into the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains...and the courageous spirit and will of the mountainfolk.",
