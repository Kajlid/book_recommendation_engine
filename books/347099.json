  "description": "With fierce determination, Hee-So continues to follow her heart — not to mention her beloved Won-Jun — everywhere! When she discovers Won-Jun is a Boy Scout (and that pesky Whie-Young too, boo!), she wants nothing more than to be a Girl Scout, especially so she can take part in the joint Scouts campout and be by Won-Jun’s side! But the other girls won’t let her get away with it that easily! Sheer willpower may not be enough to get Hee-So there…but maybe a little magic might do the trick?",
