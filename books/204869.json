  "description": "\"Whenever the people are well informed,\" Thomas Jefferson famously wrote, \"they can be trusted with their own government.\" But what happens when they are not? The United States provide a good illustration: Politicians pass resolutions denying global warming's existence, that astrology can control the weather, and, in some states, even forbid using the words \"Climate Change.\"In every aspect of our society — from transport to technology, health care to national defense — we are in the midst of an unprecedented expansion of scientific progress that has led to a simultaneous explosion of real world catastrophe. And yet many western democracies actively ignore how science might help us to survive our own ingenuity. Shawn Lawrence Otto’s provocative book investigates the historical, social, and emotional reasons for why this is the case, and offers a vision and an argument to bring us to our collective senses, before it’s too late.",
