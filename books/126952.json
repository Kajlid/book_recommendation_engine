  "description": "\"Seamless in its storytelling and enthralling in its plotting.\"--Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel\"Dark and remarkable....Once [Todd] grabs you, there's no putting the novel down.\" --Detroit Free PressThe Winston-Salem Journal declares that, \"like P. D. James and Ruth Rendell, Charles Todd writes novels that transcend genre.\" A Long Shadow proves that statement true beyond the shadow of a doubt. Once again featuring Todd's extraordinary protagonist, Scotland Yard investigator and shell-shocked World War One veteran, Inspector Ian Rutledge, A Long Shadow immerses readers in the sights and sounds of post-war Great Britain, as the damaged policeman pursues answers to a constable's slaying and the three-year-old mystery of a young girl's disappearance in a tiny Northamptonshire village. Read Todd's A Long Shadow and see why the Washington Post calls the Rutledge crime novels, \"one of the best historical series being written today.\"",
