  "description": "Like all boys, Martin had a peepee, and this peepee didn’t cause him any problems. Of course, from time to time, Martin worried a little. He wondered if one day his peepee would look like his dad’s peepee. But that’s normal, all boys wonder about that. So, everything was going quite well. That is, everything was going well until one day in the locker room the big bully Adrian started making fun of Martin’s peepee in front of everybody! Poor Martin. And to make matters worse, Martin and the bully both wanted to be the boyfriend of Anäis, the prettiest girl in school. Push came to shove, and the boys decided to have a pissing contest. So how does our story end? Is it true that in the littlest of packages come the greatest gifts? Thierry Lenain’s jolly text is joined happily with Stéphane Poulin’s exquisite but hilarious illustrations to make this a wonderful book for parents and children to share and enjoy together. Thierry Lenain taught handicapped children before becoming a writer. He has published more than fifty children’s books in Europe. In 1992, he became editor of Citrouille , a magazine about children’s literature. He has three children, and, after eighteen years at the foot of the mountains, he has moved to the edge of the sea. Stéphane Poulin is a Canadian author and illustrator. He’s been drawing passionately since he was a kid. He has published over one hundred books in North America and Canada and has won many international prizes. Daniel Zolinski is a photographer who is currently working on a collection of photographs that traces Odysseus’ journey home from the Trojan War.",
