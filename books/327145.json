  "description": "My name is Bowie, better known as Little Bo-Peep.I’m a shepherdess—someone who leads the dead to the world beyond this one.When I find a lost soldier, Sinbad, roaming among the Mallow Fields—the place where spirits are drawn so I can escort them to the ever after, I’m not sure why I feel so attracted to him.Maybe it’s owing to this attraction that I allow Sinbad to enthrall me with stories about his life at sea.Before I know what’s happened, Sinbad is tethered to me, which means he’s able to leave the Mallow Fields.Good thing for me because Sinbad becomes a protector of sorts—and protection is what I’ll need when I come across three handsome strangers—Dolion, Claude, and Jack.These three strangers claim to be sent from the Guild to find me.Why? Because apparently I’m a Chosen One.Forced into accompanying these three men into battle, I find I can’t help my attraction to all three of them.Yet there’s something about the group’s leader, Dolion, that doesn’t sit well with me.Maybe it’s because my emotions are out of my control when I’m around him, or maybe it’s owing to the fact that I keep seeing visions from another time…Whatever the reason, I know Dolion isn’t all he seems.",
