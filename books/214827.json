  "title": "The Wizard: The Fur and Quarter Pound",
  "description": "The world of Sahar is harsh, but its ancient magic and gods are far worse. A place where magic has become a drug and gods have become religious myth. Set against the backdrop of the first galaxy ever created SPECKTRA, our tale takes place on the eve of the-second-age-of-time and follows two naïve youths known as seekers. The unnamed hero and his half-brother White-Paw run out of the herb known as the green leaf. In a state of paranoid frenzy, they go to Angela’s shop of magic to try and make a deal. What transpires next is a grand adventure into the new and unknown on a soil that is nothing what it appears to be. In the end it all leads to The Transtirion, the twelve planets of SPECKTRA, and finally the Wizard himself.",
