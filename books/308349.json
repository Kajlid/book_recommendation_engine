  "description": "Andrea Clarke is a prominent psychologist living in Miami. Her life is perfectly routine and in order until one morning, when the thirty-six-year-old virtuous woman wakes up and the man she loves, Daniel Cooper, is nowhere to be found. As Andrea attempts to piece together Daniel’s disappearance, she gets a new client— a beautiful, free-spirited sex addict named Madison, who makes her reconsider everything. Now, as intriguing as Madison appears, something about her sudden appearance raises Andrea’s suspicion.\"AT SOME POINT, a woman will struggle between the woman she is and the woman she wants to be… and for Dr. Andrea Clarke, this is no exception. \"Dr. Clarke soon finds herself diving deep into Madison's immoral and sporadic lifestyle which ultimately leads her through a string of events. As days go by, and there’s still no sign of Daniel, Andrea comes to realize just how connected she is to several of her clients— especially when she suspects that one of them isn’t that much of a stranger than she initially thought.",
