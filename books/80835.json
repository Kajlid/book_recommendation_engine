  "title": "It Never Happened: A Max Cole Story",
  "description": "Max deals with high school the way she deals with panic attacks… deep breaths and denial. But denying her brother’s friend is another thing altogether...Her nickname is ‘The Kid.’ She’s small, she’s socially awkward, and she desperately wants to be left alone.For most of her childhood, Max was punished for speaking, or for just being in the way. Life improved slightly when her abusive father was no longer in the picture, but she still felt the need to be invisible.Her older brother, Nate, is extremely protective and refuses to leave her side. He shelters her so she won’t be hurt again.They had a good system until he introduced her to his new best friend.Drew wants to coax Max out into the world so she can move beyond the pain. The method each boy takes in helping Max cope with her anxiety causes more conflict than Max is prepared to handle… especially when the school heart-breaker offers her more than a brotherly shoulder to lean on.---------------------------------It Never Happened is the first book in the Starsville trilogy but can also be read as a stand alone novel. Starsville is a fictional town located in southern Ontario, Canada.",
