  "description": "\"Girls like you aren't exactly welcomed at a place like this, so keep your head down and look the other way.\" Those were the exact words of my social worker when she dropped me in my newest hellhole, a place for \"troubled teens\". I didn't listen, and now I'm on their radar. They expect me to play along in their games of hierarchy, to fall in line in the social order they've deemed me fit. Too bad for them, I don't follow rules. Too bad for me, they're determined to make sure I do. Inconceivably attractive and treated like kings...these are the boys of Brayshaw High.And I'm the girl who got in their way.",
