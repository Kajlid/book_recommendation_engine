  "description": "Faking a relationship with his boss isn't exactly what Jay had in mind for the holidays. But when he gets busted making out with Harper at the office Christmas party—by the guy's mom, no less—well... it's his best chance at a Merry Christmas this year.  Not least of all because he's had a reindeer-sized crush on Harper since the day they met.  Faking it only lasts until the searing sexual tension that's been building for months between them boils over, and they come to an arrangement: the full boyfriend experience for the few days they have together, then back to being colleagues at the end.  Should be easy, right?  But baby, it's cold outside and it's warm in bed...  A (Fake) Boyfriend For Christmas is a steamy novella-length gay romance with a HEA and all the holiday feels. It contains: office party makeouts, tree lopping shenanigans, explicit scenes, a snowball fight, oodles of holiday spirit, and true love conquering all.",
