  "description": "The Choice contains 2, brand-new, full-length novels, each with a different HEA.  Sixty days in another life, another time…it’s tempting. Now the decision to accept the pocket watch is yours. What choice will you make?  Sara Wells is in Venice, preparing to leave on a fourteen day cruise to Greece, when Gertrude offers her the pocket watch. Will she take it? You choose.  If you accept the watch, Sara will travel to eighteenth century Venice where she meets a young Scottish expatriate who owns a small ship building company. Will their love for each other be enough to overcome all obstacles?  If you refuse the watch, Sara will remain in the twenty-first century, where she will encounter a traveler from the past and more intrigue than she can pack into the books she writes.  Once you've read one, you can go back and make the other choice.  One choice, two souls, two different happy endings.  The Choice is a romance novel and thus contains several mildly explicit intimate scenes.",
