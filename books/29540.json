  "title": "Dave Barry on Dads",
  "description": "Dave Barry needs no introduction-after all, his Pulitzer Prize-winning and hysterical observations about daily life have been published in over 500 newspapers and 25 books. Now, he turns his attention to a species he knows intimately-dads. Dave famously recalls the moment he became a father: he chose to stand at the “head end” during the procedure because he assumed it would be more pleasant, but he quickly found that the “head end” was in a very bad mood and, unbelievably, seemed particularly annoyed at him! Now he’s learned a few things about being a dad and all the manly wisdom is here for the taking. The lucky dad who gets this as a Father’s Day gift won’t have to pretend to like it.",
