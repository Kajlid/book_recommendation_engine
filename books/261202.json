  "description": "Some truths don't travel well. Some of them die along the way and others stray from the flock. These are a few who survived the journey. In A Map of My Existence, Elle Wonders' unique narrative voice weaves stories into poems. With vivid, tangible imagery, she explores the world through a lens of truth and vulnerability as she creates the map of her existence. Whether it's free verse or prose poetry, she navigates the close relationship between self-awareness and emotional connection while building a bridge between the two.",
