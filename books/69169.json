  "description": "Garwyn is enjoying the Fall Festival with his friends at the lake when a horn sounds, signaling an impending attack! Jair agrees to get the children back to the village while Gar goes after Leeandra. She is in the nearby ruins gathering herbs for her mother. Finding her, they look for a place to hide while fighting off wolves. Raiders close in on their hiding place just as symbols on the floor and walls begin to glow. Magic erupts and they find themselves elsewhere. Jair joins them a little later and the three youths are given amazing gifts. The next morning they return as the chosen ones of the goddess. The battle between light and darkness begins!",
