  "description": "Anderson Bexley was the love of my life… or so I thought.⁣⁣For years, I convinced myself that one day he would see me as more than the bubbly activities director at his family’s campground. ⁣Sure, he was ten years older.⁣Deeply tortured.⁣And far too devoted to the family business to make time for his own happiness.⁣⁣But none of that mattered. Especially after one blissful night when he was all mine.⁣I thought our forever had finally begun, but he broke my heart instead.⁣⁣A year later, I’m moving on.⁣In a new city.⁣At a new job.⁣With a new man. ⁣Add in the fact that I just landed my first big account, and things can’t possibly get better.⁣⁣Until I hear my first client is none other than Anderson Bexley.⁣Now, I’m heading back to a place I had once called home.⁣Back to Camp Bexley.⁣Back to him. ⁣⁣Only this time, I’m determined to walk away on my own terms… with my heart intact.",
