  "title": "Public and Private Families: A Reader",
  "description": "This reader examines the family through two lenses--the familiar private family, in which we live our personal lives, and the public family, in which we deal with broader societal issues, such as raising the next generation, and the care of the elderly. Consequently, these readings look both at intimate, personal concerns, such as whether to marry, as well as societal concerns, such as governmental policies that affect families. The reader corresponds exactly to and is published concurrent with Cherlin's textbook \"Public and Private Families: An Introduction\"; both the textbook and the reader have 14 chapters of the same names.",
