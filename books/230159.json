Ever since Parker had won fame and fortune by gunning down the notorious Bob Dillman , he had been expecting the outlaw's partner, the deadly Stingaree to show up. And Parker knew he would have to kill Stingaree if he could! Here is a fast-moving story of a man of many names and many skills who found that his ordeal had just begun when he met his enemy.
