This book can be read independently or enjoyed as a sequel to Felicity in Marriage.Twenty-four hours have passed since our newlyweds married and experienced their first night of conjugal felicity. Now it is time that they leave London for Pemberley. Conjugal Obligation takes readers on an erotic and passion filled three days as our newlyweds travel from the Darcy's London residence to Pemberley. The trip is not all romantic interludes though when twenty miles into their journey they are waylaid when they come across a disabled carriage and a woman being brutally taken advantage of.Mr. Darcy must display courage and strength to save, not only the woman, but Elizabeth as the ruffians pull her from the carriage. In Conjugal Obligation Ayr Bray promises her readers not only the intense passion and love between her characters, but also introduces another of literature's couples that have a relationship that is a stark opposite. Ayr shows us a marriage of mind, body, and soul and then another where sexual relations are nothing more than a wife submitting to the carnal lusts and desires of her cruel husband.Conjugal Obligations will take your breath away.Readers Note: Conjugal Obligation is for adults only! This book contains super-hot sex between two of literatures most beloved characters. It also contains an instance of abuse and rape.*Note: This book can be enjoyed without the pleasure of reading Felicity in Marriage, however if you would like the full import of Fitzwilliam and Elizabeth Darcy's marital relations read both books together.",
