  "description": "My name is Ali, I was known as the goody goody, the nerdy looking girl. Now I'm known as the girl who got stabbed. I was once invisible, now I cant stop the stares and whispers.I'm no longer the girl I once was, I've changed. I'm hurt, I'm angry, and that anger is pushing the ones close to me away. One person I shouldn't be close to is the person who helps me forget, who doesn't treat me like I'm broken. I'm trying to move forward, but does moving forward mean leaving the person I love behind? Even though part of me blames him? Am I willing to move on to someone else?",
