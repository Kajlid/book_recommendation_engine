  "description": "If there ever was a beginning of a hero's life, this was it for Avry. He and Captain Slaughter's swords connected with great force. Sparks rained into the air as the swords clashed. It sill remains a wonder why the vibration didn't crack the egg open. The Treelander had never fought a pirate before, but he was trained by Prince William, one of the best swordsmen in Epalushia, and he fought without fear. His sword crashed down on Slaughter's shoulder startling the pirate. Slaughter looked stunned as he clutched his bloody shoulder. While he was distracted in pain, Willow kicked him in the leg and the egg rolled back into the water.Where can you befriend a wizard, save a dragon from extinction, battle pirates, meet mermaids, get tricked by leprechauns, travel with unicorns, dance with faeries, join the brotherhood of knights, and tangle with evil giants?Avry Blain and his four siblings quickly find out when they enter a forbidden land in a struggle to save their lives and the lives of the people from their village. Little do they know that an evil warlock named Kildane is sabotaging their world. Will their people succumb to the warlock's curse?",
