  "description": "Drew is a fireman who loves the rush of his job, and is looking for a roommate to share costs. Scott is a doctor looking for somewhere to live that doesn't leave him rooming with his now ex-lover. The match seems more than perfect when Scott moves in with Drew. It's more than just costs that they share. They find it hard to resist getting to know each other in the most intimate way, and soon things are heating up enough to make even Drew wonder if they can handle the fire.So what happens when along comes EMT Eric with his blond good looks and boyish smile? He seems like the perfect match for Drew and Scott, but just Eric moving in is not all they have to deal with. Between family strife and physical injuries, the three of them have to face problems that could tear them apart, and ruin more than just their life together, including their careers and their health. Will this twosome be able to become a threesome or does it spell disaster for all?911 is full of everything you'd expect from this author; strongly drawn characters, vulnerable sometimes, but never weak, sizzling-hot sex and fascinating exploration of an unconventional, deeply loving relationship.",
