  "description": "Two years after the murder trial of Blaine Kerne, released microbiologist Eugene \"G\" Oâ€™Donnell is still no closer to finding Kate Brennan or his healed zombie \"daughter\" Susan. Forced to return to the Army for help, G begins new research with Reggie, a fresh zombie who resembles G's dead lover. While the soldiers search for Susan and Kate, G's experiments with Reggie yield a smarter zombie, but one more emotionally distant than G had observed with Susan. In spite of Reggie's stunted emotions, he becomes attracted to his savior, and G wrestles with feelings of attraction and guilt for \"playing with his kid.\" But flirting with his patient may mean doom for the experiment.",
