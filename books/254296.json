  "description": "From bestselling author Ella Fields comes an all new standalone. An emotional new adult romance that proves love is worth fighting your demons for.  Toby Hawthorne was an enigma. One I didn’t factor into my college plans.  I wasn’t looking for love. I wasn’t not looking for it either. And in that state of in-between, he found me.  Unaware of the battle he fought everyday, I fell fast. By the time I found out, it was too late. Because I wanted everything. Every broken, lost part of him.  I knew I couldn’t fix him. I could only love him. But I should’ve known better than to think that was enough.",
