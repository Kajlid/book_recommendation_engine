Now, the members of Army Special SciOps Unit 69 are about to be exposed. When a covert operation behind enemy lines goes wrong, Sergeant Major Ian McIntire must trust Major Hannah Jackson to save his men-and his heart. She already knows most of his secrets but the one she doesn't know about the moonstruck alpha werewolf may get them all killed. She has one chance to get the Wolves undercover and safe, but it may already be too late. Ten years later, former Army sniper Michael Lightfoot's life as a forest ranger fits his need to run wild when the moon is full-until two wild wolf pups are kidnapped, along with Dr. Liz Graham, the wildlife biologist who makes him want to howl. The last thing he expects when he rescues the feisty doctor is to be moonstruck. With her life in danger, he must reveal his secrets-and risk losing her-in order to save her from the shady corporation stalking the Wolves. Warning: Secrets, lies, and betrayals are more personal under the full moon, but when a Wolf loves a woman, he'll do whatever it takes to keep her safe.",
