  "description": "Synopsis Packed with puzzles, this book is a fresh and exciting introduction to a huge range of logical, ethical and mathematical paradoxes. Description ‘If there is an exception to every rule, then every rule must have at least one exception – except this one.’ Welcome to the world of the paradox – something that appears to be true and yet contradicts itself. From Galileo’s Fan to the Cone of Democritus, and from the impossibility of motion to the infinite staircase, these mind-bending thought experiments, optical illusions and logical deceptions are on of the most interesting and accessible facets of philosophy. This Book Does Not Exist will stretch your mind, put your neurons through their paces, and challenge the foundations of your knowledge and opinions. You’ll discover that you can’t even trust your own senses – even though they may be all you have. Filled with puzzles that have intrigued the greatest philosophers, this fascinating collection of insoluble logical paradoxes will give your intellect a workout that you can’t help but enjoy.
