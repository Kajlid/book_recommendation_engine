  "description": "With the fate of king and country in their hands, they are each other's only hope...Ruined, betrayed and banished...As brave as she is impulsive, Deidre Chattan's tendency to follow her heart and not her head has finally tarnished her reputation beyond repair. But when powerful Highland Laird Quinton Cameron finds her, he couldn't care less about her pastâ€”it's her future he's about to change.But it's never too late for redemption...From the moment Quinton sets eyes on Deidre Chattan, rational thought vanishes, for in her eyes he sees a fiery spirit that matches his own, and he'll be damned if he'll let such a wild Scottish rose wither under the weight of a nun's habit.With nothing to lose, Deidre and Quinton band together to protect king and crown. But what they can accomplish alone is nothing compared to what they can build with their passion for each other.",
