  "description": "Ten years ago, Landon Kent ripped my heart out by leaving town without a word.I’ve put myself back together since then. Now, I love my life in Juniper Cove. I love the small town gossip. I love the coffee shop I run. And I especially love that I never, ever have to see that jerk again.Then Landon Kent strides back into my life, wearing a suit I’m a little too quick to imagine off of him. He’s showing up at my work, crashing my dates, and demanding I sell my business to him.The coffee I threw in his face should’ve been a subtle enough hint about how I felt about that.But no. The stubborn, grumpy jerk refuses to leave me alone.So I strike a deal. I’ll do whatever it takes to find another business for him to sink his claws in.Even if it includes pretending to be his girlfriend at a wine tasting.Even if it requires sharing a single bed in a freezing inn.I’m willing to do whatever it takes to get Landon out of town, and out of my life. Because the longer he’s here, the harder it is to deny the feelings that time has buried, and the fact that no one else has ever been able to compare.If I don’t run Landon out of town soon, I might do the unthinkable.I might fall in love with him again.",
