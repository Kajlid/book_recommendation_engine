  "description": "Jim Wade is a broken man trying to put the pieces back together.Struggling to walk the straight and narrow path after his old lady overdosed on painkillers and vodka almost a year ago, the only consistency in Jimâ€™s life is the strong bond he shares with his brothers of the Steel Talons MC. Susan McGregor is keen to impress her colleagues.A paramedic trying to secure a full-time position with her ambulance crew, Susan knows it's only a matter of time until someone calls for help from the wild biker parties on the outskirts of town. At the right place at the right time.When an accident sends Jim's bike crashing against a streetlight, he finds himself in front of Susan. Though his physical injuries are superficial, his psychological wounds begin opening up under the tender lingering touch of a woman who seems too prim and proper to ever fall for a rough biker. With only so many hours in a day who will give first, the girl or the biker?",
