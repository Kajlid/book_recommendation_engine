In its place are streets lined with panhandlers, inescapable crime, empty schools, overflowing hospices, abandoned churches, and stranglehold restrictions on what you can buy, say, and believe.New York Times bestselling author Ben Shapiro's  America 2030 is not fiction; it is a serious projection of things to come if our country continues down its current path. In between narrative snapshots of our dystopian future, Shapiro looks at the policies and people who put America's frightening transformation in motion.",
