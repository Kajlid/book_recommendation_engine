  "description": "When Jane Marchant arrives to live with her aunt and uncle in 1543, England and Scotland are at war. An unconventional upbringing among the mercenary armies of Europe has left her ill-prepared for life under her bullying uncleâ€™s rule and she welcomes the opportunity to take a letter for an injured courier across the border. She does not expect to end as prisoner of a Scottish baron.  William Scott, Lord Crawleigh has enough to worry about; war against the English, local feuds which threaten the security of his people and his country and now the arrival of a mysterious girl who may or may not be an English spy. As the borders erupt into violence he finds in Jane, an unlikely ally. But how can he trust his growing feelings for her when she will not even tell him her name? From the author of the Peninsular War Saga and the Light Division Romances, the first in a new series about the Border Reivers.",
