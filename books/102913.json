  "title": "The Living Landscape: Designing for Beauty and Biodiversity in the Home Garden",
  "description": "“This thoughtful, intelligent book is all about connectivity, addressing a natural world in which we are the primary influence.” — The New York Times Books ReviewMany gardeners today want a home landscape that nourishes and fosters wildlife, but they also want beauty, a space for the kids to play, privacy, and maybe even a vegetable patch. Sure, it’s a tall order, but  The Living Landscape  shows you how to do it. You’ll learn the strategies for making and maintaining a diverse, layered landscape—one that offers beauty on many levels, provides outdoor rooms and turf areas for children and pets, incorporates fragrance and edible plants, and provides cover, shelter, and sustenance for wildlife. Richly illustrated and informed by both a keen eye for design and an understanding of how healthy ecologies work,  The Living Landscape  will enable you to create a garden that fulfills both human needs and the needs of wildlife communities.",
