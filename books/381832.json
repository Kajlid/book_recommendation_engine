  "description": "Originally published in Manchester 1898, this rare early work on rat catching and control is both expensive and hard to find in its first edition. READ COUNTRY BOOKS have now republished it in an affordable, high quality, modern edition, using the original text. Ike Matthews was a well known pest controller in his home town of Manchester over 100 years ago. His services were much in demand by local corporations, railway companies and merchants. This book details his extermination methods acquired over some twenty five years as a full time rat catcher. During this period he not only studied the different and the best methods of catching rats, but also took great interest in their ways and habits. The book's sixty four pages contain ten detailed - How to Clear Rats from Warehouses, Offices, Store Rooms etc. - Trapping. - Ferreting. - Drugs and Chemicals. - How to Keep and Work Ferrets. - Distemper in Ferrets. - Working Ferrets. - Suitable Dogs. - The Habits and Natural History of Rats. - Life of the Rat Catcher. - Hints on Rabbit Shooting. This is a fascinating read for all with an interest in the countryside and its wildlife. The pest controller and gamekeeper, both amateur and professional, will also find much of the information contained in these pages still useful and practical, even today. Many of the earliest sporting books, particularly those dating back to the 1800s, are now extremely scarce and very expensive. READ COUNTRY BOOKS are republishing these classic works in affordable, high quality, modern editions, using the original text and artwork",
