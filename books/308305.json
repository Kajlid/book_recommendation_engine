  "description": "The team is sacred. The team is everything. And I have killed mine.I was supposed to love them, and I didn't. I tried to love them, but I couldn't. The courts condemned me to the Pit for my failings, but the Military has other plans. Aether Mages are too valuable to lose, even the ones that are too dangerous to be allowed in proper society. So now the Military has rounded up a team of innocent Fell Mages—the Mages who are Blight itself—and thrown them into the Pit with me. How do we get out? Somehow make me, an Aether Heart Mage, bond with a Fell team as a Fell Shard. It has to be a sick joke, but nobody's laughing. Except maybe the Warden, who wants to throw me into the lower levels to be used as a lab rat. The Fells came from nothing, and they don't plan on dying in the Pit. There’s the ambitious Blood, who is both cruel and infinitely kind, Rot is a giant with a terrible gift, the enigmatic Smoke, and ScatheFire, who is the closest thing to a friend I’ve ever had. There's something about each of them that brushes me like bird wings, but even if I could become a Fell Shard, my own heart is so broken I'll never love anything again, and I know nobody should ever love me. They should be more afraid of me than they are. My love devours souls. Epic dark fantasy medium-burn \"it's complicated\" love-hate reverse harem romance featuring a broken heroine who doesn't want to be put back together.",
