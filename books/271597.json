  "description": "Shortlisted for the 2017 Brage Prize Fanny, a 17-year-old high school senior, has lost both her parents in a car accident. Granted permission to live independently in the family home located on the outskirts of a small Norwegian town, the days pass by as she performs her daily routine: going to school, maintaining the house, chopping and stacking wood, and keeping the weeds at bay. As Fanny grieves and attempts to come to terms with the sad circumstances of her life, a fairy tale-like world full of new possibilities begins to emerge around her.Written by Rune Christiansen, one of Norway's most exciting literary talents, and masterfully translated by Kari Dickson, Fanny and the Mystery in the Grieving Forest is a beautiful, poetic portrait of grief, friendship, independence and transgression.Praise for Fanny and the Mystery in the Grieving Forest  \"An exquisitely written novel of grief. Rune Christiansen shows yet again why he is one of Norway's leading literary stylists. Reading him is a pleasure unlike any other.\" --Aftenposten\"Christiansen's stylistic confidence and authoritative writing lift the text to a level rarely reached in Norwegian contemporary literature. [Fanny] deserves not only literary prizes but also an audience far greater than Norway.\" &mdashDag og Tid\"A magnificent novel ... gripping, poetic and thought-provoking. 6/6 stars.\" --VG",
