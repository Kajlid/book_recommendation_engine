  "title": "Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper",
  "description": "For over 20 years, the dark secrets of the biggest criminal manhunt in British history have remained a closed book?until now. Wicked Beyond Belief is a powerful indictment of the calamitous investigation that logged two million man-hours of police work. Its revelation of crucial new evidence relating to Sutcliffe's meticulously planned methods caused newspaper headlines, and it argues convincingly that his crimes were far more extensive than admitted. With exclusive access to the detectives involved, pathologist's archives, and top-secret reports, Michael Bilton's expose is as riveting as any thriller.",
