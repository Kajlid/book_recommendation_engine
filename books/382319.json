  "description": "Rings of Alizant picks up where Ring of Destiny left off. Life has settled for the Rhomandi brothers. Personal differences are (mostly) a thing of the past…they are still brothers, after all; a wedding is on the horizon (about time Deymio made his little daughter legitimate, don’t you think?); and Alizant has a very important demonstration coming up.But the past has a way of rearing its ugly head at just the wrong moments…for weddings, demonstrations…and small children. The Rhomandi brothers’ might have laid their personal demons to rest, but Alizant has a few of his own, and Nikki’s tiny infant, Jeremin, has more than enough to keep the entire lot busy for years to come.And just to make things interesting some unexpected visitors arrive from across the channel.Will they manage to stop Deymio’s wedding? Will they destroy Alizant’s dreams? What will happen when they discover Jeremin’s secret?Join the brothers and their entourages on this next stage of their never-dull lives. Rings of Alizant is the first of three in this next arc in the ongoing saga of the Rhomatum Rings",
