  "description": "Girls are girls wherever they live—and the Sisters in Time series shows that girls are girls whenever they lived, too! This new collection brings together four historical fiction books for 8–12-year-old girls: Maureen the Detective: The Age of Immigration (covering the year 1903), Maria Takes a Stand: The Battle for Women’s Rights (1914), Carrie’s Courage: Battling the Powers of Bigotry (1923), and Anna’s Fight for Hope: The Great Depression (1931), American Progress will transport readers back to America’s national maturation of the early twentieth century, teaching important lessons of history and Christian faith. Featuring bonus educational materials such as time lines and brief biographies of key historical figures, American Progress is ideal for anytime reading and an excellent resource for home schooling.",
