But when the local postman is found dead, suddenly the war feels much closer to homeâ€¦ The police are quick to declare it an unfortunate accident, but young, spirited Anna Grix is less convinced. After striking up a fast friendship with the newly arrived American, she teams up with Eddie to dig into this apparent accident.",
