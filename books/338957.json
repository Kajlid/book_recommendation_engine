And even though Daniel knows his dad is being unreasonable, he has plenty of questions himself about being gay. When Daniel's first lover, Roderick, claims to be a vampire and attacks Daniel with such cruelty there could be no other explanation, Daniel realizes there are stranger things in the world than men who love men. Roderick insists that he loves Daniel, but refuses to change him, and Daniel learns his first lesson as an adult' where there is love, there can also be pain. Enter Roderick's creator, DeVante, whose personal code of ethics doesn’t allow enslaving mortals for either love or blood. DeVante reveals that Roderick’s vampire blood is poison to Daniel, and that Daniel must be changed or he will die. When Daniel’s half-sister gets kidnapped, he enlists the talents of his new blood-drinking friends to find her. When he brings her home, he expects to become the family hero, but discovers sometimes you really can’t go home again. Now Daniel must figure out who he is, what he wants, and if he can kill to survive.",
