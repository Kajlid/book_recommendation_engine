  "description": "Clay  I’d never even noticed her before.  The intern.  Sitting there in her baggy plaid sweatshirt.  But she was the only one left in the office and I needed a date, fast. The party and investors meeting were just a few hours away and I had to make a good showing.  So, I made her an offer—a business proposal. She’d go with me to the party and I’d write her a glowing recommendation.  Little did I know after a makeover this ugly duckling would turn into a beauty.  I never gave her second thought before.  Now I can’t get her out of my mind.  Olivia  I was just an intern.  I never thought the handsome CEO would actually ask me on a date. But it was just a business arrangement, right?  It was never going to turn into anything real.  He was much older than me and so out of my league.  But here we are, all over each other.  I don’t want to lose my virginity to him, but my body is telling me otherwise.  With every caress and deep passionate kiss, this relationship sure doesn’t seem fake anymore.",
