  "description": "\"I had been Jonathan’s slave for about a year when he told me he wanted to sell me at an auction. I wasn’t in any condition to respond when he told me this…\" So begins Carrie’s tale of uncompromising sexual adventure. Imagine the Story of O starring a Berkeley Ph.D. in comparative lit (who moonlights as a bike messenger) with a penchant for irony, self-analysis, and anal sex. Set in San Francisco and the Napa valley, Carrie’s Story takes the reader on a journey into a netherworld of slave auctions, training regimes, and human \"ponies\" preening for dressage competitions.",
