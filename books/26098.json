  "description": "New Teacher, John Randolph, is at a crossroad in his career. Should he continue to teach or try something new? During the last week of high school, he decides to tell his students the story of his Grandparents' dangerous adventure at the beginning of World War II. Their story gives a new perspective to the mysterious happenings surrounding the 1942 air raid on Los Angeles, California. Working from a diary written by a young English woman during 1941 and 1942, John Randolph weaves the events of his Grandparents' life and death struggle to find a German spy ring into the chronology of the young woman's diary entries â€“ the diary of Miss X.The author takes the reader into his story from different character's perspectives until he has the reader meet Roger Fenton, a struggling architect in Chicago who is the best friend of a bossy ball of fur named Comma. From there the author builds the pace of the story. The reader is witness to murders, an innocent man framed for murder, a life and death chase to California aboard The Super Chief train and the menace of the German spy ring just as it is poised to attack the west coast of the United States. The many twists and turns will have the reader constantly trying to get a grip on who really is good and who really is bad.As it turns out, John Randolph is a good storyteller. His students and others stay in class for the whole week to learn the fates of all the characters. I stayed for the whole story, too.",
