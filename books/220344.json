  "description": "Star Begotten is a 1937 novel by H. G. Wells. It tells the story of a series of men who conjecture upon the possibility of the human species being altered by Martians to replace their own dying planet. The first (British) edition of this novel gives the title as two words: Star Begotten. The title is hyphenated in the first U.S. edition: Star-Begotten. The book readdresses the idea of the existence of Martians, famously written about in The War of the Worlds (1898). The dialog of Star-Begotten makes brief cursory references Wells's earlier novel The War of the Worlds, referring to it as having been written by \"Conan Doyle or one of those people\". The protagonist of the story Joseph Davis, who is an author of popular histories, becomes overtaken with suspicion that he & his family have already been exposed & are starting to change.",
