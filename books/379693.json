  "title": "Dark Torment",
  "description": "In this “spell-binding romance” (Publisher’s Weekly), falsely accused, Irish-born convict Dominic Gallagher is shipped to the Australian Outback, where he is rescued from being beaten to death by Sarah Markham, the plain, no-nonsense, spinster daughter of a sheep baron. Indentured to Sarah’s father, gorgeous, blue-eyed Dominic must do “Miss Sarah’s” bidding even while the two begin to secretly burn with passion for each other. In an epic clash of wills, neither is prepared to give an inch. Then Dominic escapes, taking Sarah with him on a run for his life through the dangers of the Australian outback, and that clash of wills escalates into an explosion of heat as “Miss Sarah” and the dangerous, desperate convict find themselves falling in lust—and love.",
