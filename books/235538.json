He is expected to do this by fair means or foul.  Alys doesn’t know whether to be distressed or angry when her brother informs her he has invited the Marquis of Deveril, along with several other of his male acquaintances, to join him for a weeklong shoot at their manor house in Worcestershire.  The last time the marquis visited Alys’s home, she discovered him with a pistol in his hand as he stood over the dead body of her father.
