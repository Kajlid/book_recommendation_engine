  "title": "Warriors of the Rainbow: A Chronicle of the Greenpeace Movement from 1971 to 1979",
  "description": "A gripping personal account, this book is written by a man who participated in some of the most publicized international environmental actions ever undertaken. Robert Hunter was a much loved member of Greenpeace from its inception, when he and 10 others sailed aboard a rusting ship on a voyage to protect Canada’s waters from nuclear testing. The brains behind iconic actions—such as dying Harp Seal pups in Alaska with red paint to make their skins commercially worthless—Hunter remained one of the movement's most fondly remembered activists until his death in 2005, despite his open and candid accounts of internal politics and interpersonal strife. This updated edition features a new foreword by the Greenpeace executive director, as well as additional photographs and an author's note.",
