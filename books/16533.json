  "description": "She ran from him when she needed him the most… Ruby is a witch who knows magic can fail. She’s experienced it firsthand, with full-blown tragic consequences. Smith & Wesson is a whole hell of a lot more reliable, and nothing’s as cathartic as the ability to put a few holes in the things that piss you off. Like Derek Stormwind. A powerful sorcerer, Derek is determined to get to the bottom of why she pushed him away and ran three years before. He also needs her help to fight a demon. Ruby knows he wants back in her heart—and her bed. That’s where she wants him, too. Unfortunately, her bed’s already made, she’s about to lose her soul, and nothing can save her. Not Derek. Not even Smith & Wesson.[NOTE: Arcane Shot was originally released under the title Something About Witches .]",
