  "description": "Get ready to root for the bad girl in this short story that gives the dreaded \"evil queen\" from your favorite fairy tales her own voice. Good? Bad? Misunderstood? Love her or hate her, you won't be able to ignore her, or to put this book down until you're finished. Please note that this is a short story, written as a submission to the Kindle Singles collection, and priced accordingly. It is 9 pages long (approx. 3000 words) and contains author's notes that highlight the personal thoughts and historic influences that led me to write this little tale.I hope you enjoy the story, and thank you for supporting independent, self-published literature. Your candid reviews, Tweets, blog posts, Facebook sharing and recommendations to friends are all greatly appreciated!Best Regards,Edward H. Carpenter",
