  "description": "Scott Peterson, beta wolf in the Cloverleah Pack, has a good life. He loves his cars, riding his Harley, and going out with pack members and friends. But when an attack on his pack by a bear shifter, brings his mate into his world, from Texas of all places, Scott realizes he could lose everything he ever held dear.  Damien, Alpha wolf of the San Antonio Pack, didn’t want to go to Cloverleah and definitely didn’t want to be chasing a rogue bear shifter that was threatening the Alpha of the Cloverleah Pack. But he was in for a pleasant surprise when he finds his mate. Now, if he could just find the time to enjoy him.  Between murderous bears, deceptive wolves, two packs and a BDSM club, the road to HEA is anything but smooth for Scott and Damien. And then there’s a fire, and an Alpha Challenge, and let’s not forget Diablo and Griff’s wedding. About the only thing Scott and Damien haven’t got is time to be together, and it is that lack of time that could pull them apart.  Warning. This book is about gay wolf shifters. It contains m/m anal and oral sex, rimming and a spanking scene. There is also some violence, fighting wolves and a couple of deaths of minor characters. Child Sexual Abuse is also referred to. Please do not buy this book if these aspects offend you in any way.",
