  "title": "Damn!: A Christmas Book with Sex, Violence, Drugs & Fruitcake: The Aberrant Art of Barry Kite: All Pictures",
  "description": "This hilariously iconoclastic collection of Barry Kite's imaginative collages belongs beneath, well, almost every Christmas tree. Here's a chance to revel in your darkest humor, as Kite pokes fun at iconic Santas, reindeer, snowmen, and, of course, fruitcake. Using familiar images from fine art and popular culture, Kite pieces together brilliant, no-holds-barred compositions that dare to express what most of us are accustomed to guarding carefully in the subterranean recesses of our souls. You'll gain an entirely new understanding of the origin of Rudolph's nose in Rhinoplastic Christmas, learn about Santa's dark side in Repo Claus, and discover the true cause of airplane turbulence in the Christmas season. Ho, ho, ho, indeed (Not for children.)",
