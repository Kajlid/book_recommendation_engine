  "description": "Enter Sasha's dark world where half-naked warriors fight in the arena for sexual dominance.Son of Cleopatra and Julius Caesar, Sasha is the king of kings. He’s the pharaoh, and he’s supposed to be the most powerful man in Egypt, but he’s convinced there’s something wrong with him. Maybe he’s in heat or maybe he’s just cursed, but no pharaoh should have such an insatiable need to be mated by another man. Even worse, the man he desires has never shown an inkling of interest in him. When the young pharaoh finds himself the sole ruler of Egypt and under siege by the Romans, he has to find a way to deal with the desires consuming him or all will be lost.*Historically inspired dark erotica.
