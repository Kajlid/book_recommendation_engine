  "description": "Primarily aimed at first-time fathers, this guidebook not only helps men understand the process they go through when dealing with pregnancy but also shows them how they can participate in positive ways. Author Pratik Patil offers information and advice that doesn’t appear in other pregnancy guides. The main purpose of this book is to help men help their wives during pregnancy and also to teach them how to take care of their own physical and mental health in their journey into pregnancy. Expectant fathers will learn how to prepare their bodies to promote a successful pregnancy, how they can support their wives during those nine months, and how to handle a newborn infant, along with other tips on parenting—all of which is the first step toward being a great dad.  But Pregnancy and Men isn’t just for men. It also enlightens women about what their husbands go through during pregnancy. Encouraging empathy, responsibility, and a positive attitude, it’s a must-read for anyone planning to start a family.",
