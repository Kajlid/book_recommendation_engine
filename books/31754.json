  "description": "Lie, cheat or steal, no one can catch Tripp Fox. Except one woman. Lexi Shepherd’s knack for finding whatever is asked of her isn’t sheer luck. It’s a gift from the Greek god Zeus. That Lexi doesn’t use her ability to search for “Mr. Right” comes from one of many personal rules she has set for herself. Number one is not to let fate dictate her future. Falling in love with Tripp breaks all the others. Despite her principles, Lexi’s unable to stay away from the bad boy, and she finds herself toeing the grey line of the law for him. Zeus, though, didn’t give Lexi and Tripp their talents to make their relationship a simple, easy alliance. He designed it to be exactly the opposite. Impossible. Always. With their separation, Lexi expects Tripp to forfeit love in favor of destiny. He, on the other hand, intends to beat Zeus at his own game. With a plan in place, Tripp challenges Lexi to take the one action no one else can. Find him. The question isn’t can she ... but will she?",
