But below the sunny surface of this sleepy, well-to-do coastal island town lies an evil that escalates into the cold-blooded murder of one of Holly's new colleagues.An outsider, Holly has little to go on for answers and no one to help her—except Daisy, a Doberman of exceptional intelligence and loyalty. The dog becomes her companion and protector. The closer Holly gets to the truth in Orchid Beach, the more she knows that it'll take one smart dog with guts to sniff out this killer—before he catches her first.",
