Brought up in the 'live for likes' culture, Digi Lynch has amassed an impressive following.

Digi can't turn a corner for fear of being pranked and his reaction blasted online. And after one of Gram's most high scale pranks yet, Digi decides it's time to get even.  The animosity between Digi and Gram heats up as old feelings resurface, and Digi is forced to decide whether a life in the limelight is worth it ...  Before they both go too far.  A YA contemporary novella, To Be Continued is the prequel to Not Gonna Lie and will show you where it all began for Gram and Digi.",
