And that's how he wants things to seem - normal.Deep down, however, the guilt of letting his closest friend drown in the school's swimming pool gnaws at him. And even as he punishes himself by hiding from the world and shying away from love and friendship, he feels drawn to the fascinating Brahmi - a girl quite like him, yet so different. No matter how hard Radhu tries not to, he begins to care ...Then life throws him into the deep end and he has to face his worst fears.Will love be strong enough to pull him out?\n  The Boy Who Loved \n, the first of a two-part romance, is warm and dark, edgy and quirky, wonderfully realistic and dangerously unreal.",
