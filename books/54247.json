  "title": "Tangerine City: A Book of Twenty Short Stories",
  "description": "'Tangerine City' is a book of twenty short stories ranging from the tale of a modern day 'Christ' in 'House of God's Rainbow' through to a story of attack in the suburbs in 'End of the Road'. In 'The Lost Banner of Hertford-Darcy' a housewife tries to trace the remnants of a family coat of arms and in 'The Rose Garden' a story of puzzlement and mystery takes place against a background of impending war. Often these tales will be full of irony or possess a twist in the tale. From the macabre 'Strange Tale of Jezediel Fryhopper' to the innocence of 'The Snow-Globe' these stories should entertain and delight you in the way only Hilary West can.",
