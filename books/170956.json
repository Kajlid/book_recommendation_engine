  "description": "What happens when fantasy becomes reality?  Kendra was a normal girl trying to finish out her senior year of high school. Little did she know what Fate had in store for her. Cade McCoy was a natural born protector, or so his friends told Kendra. Personally, she just thought he was an overbearing caveman with good looks, and an unexplainable need to watch over her. After one shocking afternoon when fantasy became reality, she soon found herself immersed in wolf shifter pack life, while trying to keep their secret from her own kind, humans. A chance encounter with another pack forces the McCoy Pack to appear before the High Council to atone for their actions. The real kicker? Apparently she’s not as human as she thought.  Join Kendra as she begins her journey to discover her past, learn about her present, and transform the future…for all shifters.  Hidden Trilogy HIDDEN SURFACED (Coming Soon) RISEN (Will Follow SURFACED)",
