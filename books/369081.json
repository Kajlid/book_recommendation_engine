  "description": "This original graphic novel tells the harrowing story of a detachment of Special Forces soldiers on a simple recon mission into the village of DONG XOAI that turned suddenly deadly. It has the unique perspective of being in the very early days of the Vietnam War and Kubert is basing the story on extensive information gathered from the surviving members of the unit. It will cover not only the action of the event but the details of deployment and build-up that lead to the deadly encounter for these young American G.I.s.",
