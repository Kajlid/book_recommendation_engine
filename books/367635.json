  "description": "Bruce, in the 1970s, takes over a financial consultancy firm founded by his father, while Marisa inherits property. Love, lust and money are the things that drive them both, until their relationship comes under strain. Bruce moves deeper into the world of commerce, while Marisa's direction has social and political ramifications. Twenty-five years after the end of their affair, a chance entry in one of Bruce's business listings shows that Marisa is now boss of the Rae Agency - a media PR concern. Bruce, as he recollects their partnership, is torn between his staid if harmonious family life, and renewing contact with Marisa. Finally, when he does decide on a course of action, he has to face the truth of not having grasped the widening cultural and social separation their two different views of the world have wrought over the intervening quarter century.",
