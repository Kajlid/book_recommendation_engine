  "description": "Losing her mind, losing her panties…and maybe losing her lover. \n\nA Maggie Mae Misadventure\nMaggie Mae Castro is sure she’s either losing her mind or she’s fallen in love. She’s not sure which would be worse. Lately she can’t find anything, not her lipstick nor her grandma’s pill case. All she wants is an aspirin and the ability to fire Shasta, the most useless beauty consultant to ever breathe air. When Shasta winds up dead, crushed by steel shelves full of Shy Kitty cosmetics, Maggie doesn’t believe it’s an accident. Things get even stranger when anonymous gifts arrive, each with the same “You’re mine, Maggie.” FBI Special Agent Clive Poole doesn’t like strange men sending his girlfriend flowers and presents. He especially doesn’t like the possibility that the creep might also be responsible for Shasta’s death. He’s sticking to Maggie day and night. Maggie is his and only his. Maggie isn’t thrilled about this, especially since their last full-frontal encounter ended with her dropping her reservations and her panties. But Clive will stop at nothing to keep Maggie safe from a madman who would do anything to have her. \nAnything. \n Contains inappropriate make-out sessions, a stalker with a stun gun, a super-protective Super Agent, a deadly gift with purchase, and the possibility that it might just be love and not insanity. We’re talking about Maggie Mae Castro here—you never know what’s going to go down.",
