Instead, Lera becomes more reckless than ever. When she brazenly risks her life to win an argument, Coal’s last thread of control snaps.If Lera wants to play deadly games, she’ll need to get through Coal first—and he’s done playing.HIDE AND SEEK is the sixth episode in the GREAT FALLS ACADEMY novella series. The story takes place in the same world as Alex’s KDP All Star-winning POWER OF FIVE novels but can be read independently.",
