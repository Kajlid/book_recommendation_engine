  "description": "You’ve made it to the Tower. Hope starts here.These are the words we say to greet the scared, the injured, the hungry, when they finally reach the last safe haven. The Tower is the only refuge from the Blighted Plague that has ravaged the land and turned the survivors into flesh-hungry animals. We are the lucky ones, and everyone else is condemned to die. Mother tells us so.Then one day, a dangerous man and his brutal brothers threaten to tear these lies apart. Dexer is an adrenaline rush who leaves me breathless. Blaize makes my heart pound in ways I never thought possible, and Keenan fell from grace only to lift me up. They call me Beauty, and I am theirs in a brutal world.But while the Tower still stands, we’re doomed to fall. I’ve lost so much already, and I won’t watch my men die.This is no fairy tale. This is war. Author’s note: Beauty So Golden is a standalone reverse harem romance based on the fairy tale Rapunzel, set in a post-apocalyptic zombie world. The story is sweetly smutty and delicious. The Ledger brother are competitive and possessive, and the heroine never has to choose just one man.",
