  "description": "From readers of bare roots:\"bare roots is the one book I read constantly and never get sick of.\"\"I cried reading most of it. I even had to take some breaks. It's just so incredibly relatable.\"\"Absolutely obsessed and inspired.\"\"I feel so seen reading her work; it's very powerful.\"\"WOW. Her writing truly heals.\" bare roots has consistently been a bestseller in women's poetry since its debut in April of 2017. Readers were originally captivated by Hillery's fiesty, feminine style of poetry and her ability to bear her soul [and trauma] to the world. Published six months before the rise and height of the \"Me Too\" Movement, Hillery echoes sentiments bravely expressed by many women who decided that enough was enough. She hopes that by sharing her story of trauma and mental illness, she will empower other women to continue to speak up and rise above.[Original description]: \"bare roots is a collection of poetry written for anyone that has ever buried parts of themselves away from the world. The book is divided into six partsâ€” Pruning the Damage, Battling the Weeds, The Roses [and the Thorns], The Seedling Shall Blossom, Cultivating Wisdom, and Buds of Hope are delicately crafted segments that touch on the subjects of femininity, love and loss, trauma, mental illness, the search for meaning, and ultimately, how to grow from it all.\" Some portions of this book contain mature content and may be triggering to some readers.",
