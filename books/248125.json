  "description": "The island of Galveston had been baptized twice--once by water in the fall of 1900 and again by magic during Mardi Gras in 2004. Creatures were born of survivors' joy and sufferers' pain: scorpions the size of dogs, the crying clown, the widow who ate her victims. Galveston forever would be divided between reality and a city locked in an endless Mardi Gras.",
