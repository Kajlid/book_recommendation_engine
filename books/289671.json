  "description": "The star of Juli치n Is a Mermaid makes a joyful return--and finds a new friend--at a wedding to be remembered. Juli치n and his abuela are attending a wedding. Better yet, Juli치n is in the wedding along with his cousin Marisol. When wedding duties are fulfilled and with a new dog friend in tow, the pair takes off to roam the venue, exploring everywhere from underneath tables to enchanting willow trees to . . . muddy puddles? After all, it wouldn't be a wedding without fun, laughter, and a little magical mischief. With ingenuity and heart, author-illustrator Jessica Love tells a charming story of friendship, acceptance, and celebration.",
