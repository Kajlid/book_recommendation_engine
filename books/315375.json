  "description": "When the engineering firm Evan worked for shut down, he accepted retirement at thirty-one years old rather than working for the company that bought out the firm. While not billionaire rich, his patent royalties would support a comfortable lifestyle. While fishing on the dock of a little lakeside cabin, he certainly didn’t expect a hungry mountain lion to come begging for his fish and quickly turn his life upside down. The adventures he would have with his new feline companion would change everything he thought he knew about himself and alter his plans dramatically. So much for the retired life in a fishing cabin by the lake. Shortly after his encounter with the mountain lion, he found himself with an uninvited houseguest. Tabbi was gorgeous, tall, and leggy with tawny blonde hair and golden-brown eyes. She was young and stubborn with some unusual quirks, but we can’t all be perfect. With some coaching from her, he found his latent talents. Along this journey of discovery about himself, he meets an interesting group of people and makes a network of friends and foes as he learns about his lost heritage. While he and his new friends and companions work together to defend themselves from enemies that have evaded them for years, a shadow group in the wings watches. Evan has earned the attention of a darker faction. This story includes adult content and is not suitable for children or sensitive readers. There are sex, violence, and harem elements.
