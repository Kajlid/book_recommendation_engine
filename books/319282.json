  "description": "The ManipulatorI can manipulate the emotions of anyone who lets me.I will make you hurt, make you cry, make you laugh and sigh.But my words don't affect him. Especially not when I plead for him to leave.He's always there, watching and waiting.And I can never look away.Not when I want him to come closer.The ShadowI didn't mean to fall in love.But now that I have, I can't stay away.I'm mesmerized by her smile, by her eyes, and the way she moves.The way she undresses...I'll keep watching and waiting. Until I can make her mine.And once she is, I'll never let her go.Not even when she begs me to.",
