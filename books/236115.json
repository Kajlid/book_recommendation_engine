  "title": "How Samantha Smart Became a Revolutionary",
  "description": "In this incisive pre-dystopian novel that has echoes of 1984 – where world events are driven by fear mongering and finger pointing, Dawn Green shows a society divided and opposed, a world eerily like our own. At the center of the turmoil is Samantha Smart, an ordinary girl who gets caught up in the struggle – and eventually becomes leader of the protest that faces off against the dark forces that are taking over the world.",
