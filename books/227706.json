  "description": "A hundred years ago evil scientists spliced human genes with those of animals, creating a genetic mutation passed on through the generations. Hated because of their differences, these Ge-Mis live on the fringes of society where they scrounge and scrape to get by.  Nevada is half Ge-Mi, and hides that fact behind baggy clothes and by keeping distance between himself and everyone around him. One day his peaceful life is shattered by an explosion and the arrival of a pack of wolves to sniff out the culprit. Wolves have excellent noses and as Alpha, Taylor can sniff out every one of Nevada's secretsâ€”and the harder Nevada tries to resist, the more difficult staying away from Taylor becomes.",
