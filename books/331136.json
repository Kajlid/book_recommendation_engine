  "description": "FOX News legal correspondent and former Federal Prosecutor Lis Wiehl has created a suspense series as timely as tomorrow's headlines.While home on break, a seventeen-year-old Senate page takes her dog out for a walk and never returns. The resulting media firestorm quickly ensnares television reporter Cassidy Shaw, Federal Prosecutor Allison Pierce, and FBI Special Agent Nicole Hedges. Together, these life-long friends call themselves The Triple Threat—a nickname derived from their favorite dessert as well as their uncanny ability to crack cases from their three unique positions of power.Together, they must find the one face of betrayal amidst a crowd of growing suspects—including a US Senator—before they become the next victims.Lis Wiehl's expertise in law, politics, and criminal investigation merges with April Henry's narrative genius to create a gripping mystery filled with rich characters, real danger, and a shocking yet satisfying final twist.",
