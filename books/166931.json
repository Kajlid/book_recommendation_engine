  "description": "What’s your dirty little secret? For Xavia Kennedy it was freedom. Escape from a pastel painted life ruled by an American dynasty and headed by a formidable foe. One wanted to escape. Her family. X has a plan. Get serious and get the hell out of Bean Town. Away from the pretty people and boring as hell lives. Then she met him. Smooth talking and gorgeous. All it took was a dim hall. He called their hook-up a mistake. No problem. She walked away without a name, just an impression. That was the hottest sex she’d had minus the actual sex. After one Nantucket party too many, Xavia ends up cutting bait and heading to D.C. She hops aboard the crazy train as the newest intern to Bennett Stone.  Or Senator Stone as he’s known on the Hill. He’s more than Cosmo’s sexiest congressman. He’s complicated. A mystery. Ben doesn’t date. He’s got his own dirty secrets. But where X is concerned, there’s one he’s willing to share. If she agrees to his terms. In his bed, it’s way. All she needs to do is learn to stop arguing.  Impossible when she finds out the connection they share runs too deep to put aside, and she begins to fear the secret under the secret that’s left unsaid.",
