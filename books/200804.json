  "title": "Morning In The Burned House: Poems",
  "description": "The renowned poet and author of  The Handmaid’s Tale  “brings a swift, powerful energy” to this “intimate and immediate” poetry collection ( Publishers Weekly ). These beautifully crafted poems, by turns dark, playful, intensely moving, tender, and intimate, are some of Margaret Atwood’s most accomplished and versatile works. Some draw on history and some on myth, both classical and popular. Others, more personal, concern themselves with love, with the fragility of the natural world, and with death. Generous, searing, compassionate, and disturbing, this poetry rises out of human experience to seek a level between luminous memory and the realities of the everyday, between the capacity to inflict and the strength to forgive.",
