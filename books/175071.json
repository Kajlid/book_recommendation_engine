  "description": "After years of war, the world turned cold and cruel. Lycans ruled over humans and kept them as slaves, doing with them as they pleased. Emily grew up in the Firewater territory, ruled over by the lustful Alpha William Collins. He took what he wanted when and where he wanted it and he always wanted women. He used them as his toys, a trait that many of his subjects copied. The streets were filled with brothels, whores stood at every corner and young girls were taken from their parents to join them. Fearing for her life, Emily's parents kept her hidden and pure but nothing can stay hidden forever. Will Emily survive when she becomes Alpha William's property or can she tame his lustful soul?",
