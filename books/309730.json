  "description": "From the Fame had come early to Daniel Morley. At 27 he was a famous novelist - attractive, intelligent, and intuitive.People liked him at sight - especially women - and to the world at large he was a man much to be envied. But deep inside himself lurked a frightful and never to be revealed secret which made his life a nightmare. For Daniel Morley knew that he was a pathological murderer who had already struck twice, neatly and undetectably, and that he might do so again... Here in a gripping, nerve shattering story is the portrait of a man who was quite normal except for a few minutes of his entire adult life. What occurred during those crucial ten minutes? And what influence did the red scarf have on his destiny?",
