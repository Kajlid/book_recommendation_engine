  "description": "Alternate Cover edition for ISBN 1489570292 (ISBN13: 9781489570291)Rose-May was one of those girls who had it all - she was pretty, popular, had a family who cared about her more than the world, a cousin Callum who was always there for her, she always came top of the class and with the support of her teachers, her and her best friend Shazia were potential best-selling authors. That was exactly why things started falling apart. Through a traumatizing and unexpected twist in her life, out of desperation, she accepted her dad's offer to live with him in America. Forever. It wasn't going to be as good as she thought. Her life took a turn for the worse - she was getting into gangs, crime and bad friendships. It wasn't long before her dad's work situation was falling downhill. On Valentine's Day, her new friend Yasmine was almost murdered, and Rose-May's dreams of becoming a writer were slipping away through her fingers. Would life ever go back to the way it was?",
