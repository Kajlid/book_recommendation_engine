  "description": "The authors of 'If You Were a Penguin,' Wendell and Florence Minor, turn their attention to bears in the educational picture book. If You Were a Panda Bear introduces different types of bears to young children. Through the poems in this charming storybook, kids will learn that pandas are shy and eat bamboo, black bears love to climb trees, and grizzly bears can be up to ten feet tall. A section at the back includes even more fun animal facts. The full-color illustrations are playful and bring the personality of each bear wonderfully to life.",
