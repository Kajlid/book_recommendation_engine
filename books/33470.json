  "description": "This book is written in first person by a recollection of a child’s memory, based on a disturbing true story, mine. Not all of the events that take place in this book are completely true, but most of them, unfortunately are.I am sharing my story of child abuse not only to help you be aware of your own surroundings but mostly to make you pay very close attention to the children in your lives.My goal is to make you aware of the very real monsters that are out there in our everyday lives. Make sure that you are very careful who you bring into your children’s lives. You must be there to protect them and stay involved in their lives always.Let them know that you are on their side. Try to teach your child what is right and what is wrong Tell them that you love them and make sure they know that they can trust you enough to tell you anything. Give your child a hug and a smile at least once a day.I have not shared my story before now. I have survived life living day to day telling myself to leave the past in the past. Maybe I was ashamed of what happened to me or maybe I was afraid to bring back all the sadness, fear, despair, and helplessness. Writing my story has been self healing, yet very frightening, because I had to relive my past as I wrote about it. During my writing process, I experienced horrible vivid nightmares.Writing, thankfully has worked for me. The more I write; the fewer nightmares I have. I know a lot of abused people like me; have kept quiet all of their lives. I hope that this book inspires you to be brave enough to face your own demons and inspires you to write it all down. First for your own sake, and afterwards, if you choose to, share your story with others, like I finally am.",
