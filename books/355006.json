  "description": "Learn to dance the cool Foxtrot or the sexy Samba with Anton, the star of the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, the British version of Dancing with the Stars. Anton Du Beke's passion for Ballroom dancing began when he was 14 and he is now one of our world-class dancers, leading choreographers and teachers. This book does more than simply guide you through the steps, it shows what makes dancing with a partner so amazing. The feeling of getting the movements right, the connection between two people dressed for a fabulous time on the dance floor, and the building of that relationship with a partner are all part of what make Ballroom and Latin great to perform. For each of the five Ballroom dances and five Latin dances, Anton describes the history and origins of the dance, with step-by-step photography and glorious action shots from the past. He then gives easy to-follow instruction to help you master those steps at home or in dance class. And this is all captured on a dynamic DVD too, demonstrating the steps of four of the individual dances. \"Every woman in the world should have half an hour with Anton Du Beke\" says Anton's first partner, Lesley Garrett, on the hit series, BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, and now you can too. Dance Class is the ultimate dancing companion by the master choreographer of Ballroom",
