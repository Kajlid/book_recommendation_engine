  "description": "Susan Melville certainly doesn't look the part of a fierce assassin. But the prim middle-aged spinster plays that role to the hilt when the occasion demands it. Although her free-lance hit-lady days are over, she still dabbles in a meaningful murder, if the victim is deserving.But this time, she's bound and determined to uncover another kind of mystery and exact a very personal revenge. With her U.N. connections and some high-class finagling, Susan is in the right place to vindicate the death of her own father -- murdered at the hands of a vicious South American dictator years ago. Ever the correct society matron, Miss Melville hits on the perfect plan -- until a few purposeful accidents and overlooked details threaten to send disaster her way . . . .\"Witty, sophisticated and amusing.\" --Roanoke Times & World-News",
