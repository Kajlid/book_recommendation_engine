  "description": "I was twelve-years-old when my life was stolen. I can recall becoming a helpless victim of sexual abuse. The abuse continued for three years. I was forced to see him every day, until one day he disappeared, leaving me with nothing but shattered dreams and scars that bled hopelessness, suicide, and shame. Forced to bear the burden alone, I struggled with trying to find who I was and why he chose me.Â Scrapes and Scars chronicle the unapologetic story of my journey to overcome the agony and devastation of a horrifying childhood experience. One that was meant to cripple and challenge my very being for life, but I learned that obstacles and trials were meant to be defeated. Through this journey, you too will learn that the scrapes and scars of your past do not define you; your ability to overcome them does.",
