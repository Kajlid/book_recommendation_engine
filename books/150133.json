  "description": "Raised by a gambling-addicted father, dog trainer Lulah Wallis yearns for some security in her life. And everything's looking good with a job promotion at Dog Haven Sanctuary in her sights, plus the opportunity to buy the modest cabin she calls home. Adding a hot, reliable boyfriend to the mix would see her totally fulfilled.Combat PTSD from two tours in Afghanistan has left Vince Marr with a failed marriage and blocked access to his precious daughter. Crippled by flashbacks of the war that came home with him, he's keeping his head down to prevent anyone stateside becoming a victim of his inner battle. Finding a kindred spirit in Calliope, a rescued pit bull, he lets Lulah talk him into training her, together, as his service dog.As Lulah and Vince work together, their connection unintentionally deepens. Vince isn't the rock Lulah hoped for, but she sees enough hope to persuade him to seek help for his condition. For Vince, having someone see the better man he could be is just what he needs to make the effort. Growing friendship ignites a passion neither can resist, but the doubts cast by their deep scars grow along with itâ€”and old wounds are slow to heal. For both of them love is unsafe, and trust is a terrible risk. This time, it might be worth it.",
