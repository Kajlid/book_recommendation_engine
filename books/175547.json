They are co-owners of Dreams Take Flight, a travel agency. Valerie firmly believes in the inevitable encounter with her soul mate, the love of her life. Christine dismisses this idea as a flight of fancy, until the day she meets the unexpected love of her life. At her favorite club Sappho, she sees a beautiful stranger and feels like she has been struck by lightning. Their eyes meet and lock for a moment, but suddenly, the attractive mystery woman vanishes. Christine enters an exciting emotional rollercoaster when she moves heaven and earth to find her again.",
