  "description": "When life gives you ballads, you learn to sing along . . . John Johnson had no idea the ramifications of choosing his alcoholic father over his desperate mother all those years ago when he was only thirteen. All he knew then was he needed to be where the music was, and that was with Orson—the man he called Dad. As John navigates love with Val, the girl living next door to his aunt and uncle, a car crash and his destructive relationship with his father threaten to sever his ties with Val for good. In the face of despair, it's Orson who rekindles hope by providing John an unanticipated lifeline—a spot in his band. Touring with the band fuels John's dreams of making it big, but once again, he's faced with Orson's debilitating demons. No matter how hard John tries to propel the band to success, Orson's reckless actions deliver devastating blows, leading to a final tour with a gut-wrenching crescendo. As he grapples with a past shrouded in haunting melodies, John discovers he has demons of his own. Can he break free to live the life he deserves? Or will his heart remain forever on the road? A Star is Born meets A River Runs Through it in this coming of age family drama set against the rustic backdrop of rural Montana.",
