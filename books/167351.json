  "description": "It all started out as an innocent family holiday to South Sudan, the land of my ancestry. Being reluctantly dragged along by my father in hopes of that his kids get in touch with their roots, we soon found ourselves trapped in an unfamiliar land, trying to escape the political unrest as two powerful leaders fought for the right to rule this land. Juba, South Sudan, December 2013.",
