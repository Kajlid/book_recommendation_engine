  "description": "Living in Sarvyr hasn’t been easy for Adastros since his father’s death. Lysmatchus left behind an incredible legacy that few believe Adastros can live up to. Just when Adastros thinks he has proven himself and his future is set, lies, schemes, and murder destroy any hope of a life in Sarvyr and force him to flee his home.  With nothing left to lose, Adastros sets out to follow his dream, prove his worth, and honor his father’s memory. The legendary Golden Den may seem like nothing more than a myth, but Adastros knows proving its existence will etch his name in history forever. Unfortunately, his escape from Sarvyr has left him stranded with few supplies and no idea where to begin his search–  and in more danger than he realizes. When he stumbles across an ancient elven city, he is thrust into the middle of an unprecedented war threatening the elves’ survival. Will Adastros have what it takes to turn the tide of battle? Could this be his own legacy?",
