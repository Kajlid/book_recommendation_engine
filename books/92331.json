  "description": "\"Just when it looks as if detective fiction has plowed every gory, suspenseful possibility, along comes a novel that raises the stakes on the genre. Tropic of Night introduces the killer as enchanter, a conjurer schooled in African sorcery. This witch floats through the story literally unseen by his victims, whom he forces to see and hear only what he wants them to. It's a frightening concept executed with poetic vision and authority.",
