  "description": "She’s hunted for what she is. He hunts those who would hurt them.When Astrid is attacked by a creep calling himself a Slayer, it seems like a cruel prank the universe is pulling on her already crappy life.Then Kaden, the most infuriating, stunning boy she’s ever met, arrives and tells her she’s a dragon-kin like him—part dragon, part human.Then Astrid actually shifts into a dragon. A creature from fairy tales and legends. A monster in modern times.Wonderful.It's not wonderful to Kaden, who should be busy hunting down the Slayers, a group as vicious as his methods and as dark as his past. He doesn’t have time to chaperone a girl with newly awakened dragon powers, one who’s too stubborn to stay safe. He knows from hard experience not to get involved with anyone or anything. He knows he should stay away from Astrid.Yet working together becomes vital when the Slayers hatch a new plan to destroy the dragon-kin, headed by a deadly new leader. And with Astrid as their prime target, Kaden might be the only one who can stop them…if the secrets they both carry don’t destroy them first.Perfect for fans of Michelle Madow, A.L. Knorr, and Harry Potter; if you love fast-paced YA urban fantasies, dragon shifters, undiscovered magic, twisting magical mysteries, and a slow burn enemies-to-lovers romance, sink your teeth into Dragon Born!",
