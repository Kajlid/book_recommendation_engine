  "description": "David Graham, Elisabeth Hale, and Liam Brock crossed the Atlantic on a tumultuous, life-changing voyage seven years past. Thrown together by chance, bound by choice—their story continues.David and Elisabeth begin to build a life together in 1790 Philadelphia, defying both her father and the old standard of marrying within one's class. While David is caught up in documenting the politics of post-Revolutionary America, Elisabeth takes a quiet, yet active role in the community, aiding women less fortunate than herself.Liam, on the other hand, continues to dally with a variety of Philadelphia's young women, including the insatiable and soulless Victoria Billings. When Elisabeth's attractive, intelligent, but tenuously married friend Rhiannon Ross arrives from England, she grabs Liam’s interest from the outset, in spite of the fact he sees her as yet another reminder of his limitations. His poor, rural Scottish roots and questionable parentage negate the possibility of a professional legal career in his mind—not to mention the love of a fine, yet fiery and independent woman like Rhiannon Ross.Voices Whisper, the second book in the Voices series, follows Liam’s struggles to make the most of this new country in which a man can create his destiny, regardless of his roots.",
