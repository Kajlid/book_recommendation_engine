  "description": "On an early morning walk, a young girl finds the body of her classmate, Tim Pieters, hidden amongst some bushes. The Pieters’ family are desperate for answers but the killer is never found. Almost two decades later, political pressure sees the cold case reopened and Detective Ella Marconi inherits the job. Ella attacks the case with vigour, determined to shake off the memories of her last investigation, which ended with her being shot in the line of duty. But she knows it won’t be easy—after all this time the murderer is probably long gone and the memories of any witnesses are fading. The more Ella digs into the past, the more the buried secrets and lies are brought to the surface. Georgie Riley, the girl who found Tim’s body, is now a paramedic, trying to face up to her own demons. Her co-worker and old school friend, Freya, knows more about the Pieters’ case than she is willing to divulge. And Tim’s mother, once so eager for the case to be taken seriously by police, is refusing to talk. Once the investigation is under way, Georgie believes she is being stalked by a man from her past, and when Ella receives an anonymous call insisting that Georgie has information about the Pieters’ case, Ella decides to dig deeper. Is Tim’s killer trying to tie up loose ends? Can Ella find the murderer before more people are hurt? And why, when all she wants is the truth, is everyone around her lying?",
