  "title": "Dark Angels: A Novel of the Future Past",
  "description": "The setting is the near future. People across the city are dying. An unidentified virus, a political assassin, a serial killer—or something far worse.A novel written on the edge. Not exactly science fiction, Dark Angels occupies a place between past and future—which isn’t exactly the present. Metaphysical and political by implication, the novel depicts a world that isn’t so much a dystopia as simply a slight variation on the world we live in.What if the system that rules the world could read your mind, anticipate your every desire, your every thought? What if crime were allowed, as long as it was predictable? What if all this happened twenty years ago and you didn’t know it? And what if the system inexplicably started to lose control? Welcome to the world of Dark Angels.",
