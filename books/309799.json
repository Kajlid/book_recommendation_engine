  "title": "Covid-19 A Physician's Take on the Exaggerated Fear of the Coronavirus",
  "description": "Brief essays methodically examine the major Covid-19 issues – masks, social distancing, natural immune systems, treatments and vaccines ― to determine what is fact and what is myth in the current intensely political debate. The book is written by a family physician who pointedly differs on the threat posed by Covid-19 to the American people, then challenges current conventional wisdom on what should be done about the schools, the economy and public activity with reason, honesty and scientific findings.",
