Instead, it's a meet-puke when I find Callum Quinn throwing up on my front lawn. We’ve both come a long way since high school. I’m a free spirit single mom, back in town with twin boys and a family farm to save. Even though we're both divorced and carrying baggage but my heart still beats for the dirty talking good guy.Will a roll in the hay for old time’s sake be enough to get this out of our systems? He was my first love, can I make him my last? Keeping You is a full-length, standalone, steamy, small town, slow burn, contemporary romance featuring a sassy single mom heroine and a lovable good guy hero. May contain adult language, barn sexy times, a vindictive rooster, a meet puke and lots of literal and figurative fireworks. HEA guaranteed.",
