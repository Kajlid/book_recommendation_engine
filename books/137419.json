  "description": "New Orleans is no place for an independent woman. Amid the intrigue and glamour of the delta city, Lucie must find her own way as she struggles to recover from devastating loss and what she fears is the end of love. The last thing she wants is to be beholden to a man – especially a man as infuriating and intriguing as the mysterious newcomer from Spain. Stephen Arroyo is known in New Orleans as a cool-headed gambler with a shadowy past. Robbed of what was most precious to him, Stephen is caught in a fierce battle for revenge and redemption. Lucie and Stephen need each other, in ways they can only begin to understand. But can they overcome the demons that entrap their hearts and give in to the powerful force that pulls them together? This meticulously researched and wildly romantic historical novel takes readers from the jungles of Mexico to the glittering elegance of 1840’s New Orleans. Creole Moon is the first Kindle ebook release from historical romance author Genevieve Stuart.",
