  "description": "As the youngest billionaire CEO on the east coast of the United States, Talon Grant has everything he's ever wanted. His security tech company is set to take over America and allows him to provide his family with a luxurious lifestyle. When his new assistant, Raechel, enters his life, he isn’t sure how he ever got along without her. But outside the office, he's realized something is missing...For over three months, Raechel Winters has worked alongside her focused—and mystifyingly single—boss, Talon Grant. But after ninety-four days (who’s counting?) of becoming indispensable as his assistant, she’s clueless on how to move things to a personal level. The annual Grant Security, Inc. holiday party is her chance to turn that around. Queue her two best girlfriends, also single and ready to mingle! What none of them predicts is a series of pitfalls that seems destined to foil all their plans, including a potential rival for Talon’s heart. As the girls’ attempts to help Raechel’s love life throws them into the paths of their own messy happily-ever-afters, confusion and hilarity ensue. But beware, only one will be the belle of this jingle ball!",
