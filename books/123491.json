  "description": "Brought to you by Penguin.**LONGLISTED FOR THE WOMEN’S PRIZE FOR NON-FICTION 2024**\nWhat do three murderers, Karl Marx's daughter and a vegetarian vicar have in common?\n\nThey all helped create the Oxford English Dictionary.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary has long been associated with elite institutions and Victorian men. But the Dictionary didn't just belong to the experts; it relied on contributions from members of the public. By 1928, its 414,825 entries had been crowdsourced from a surprising and diverse group of people, from astronomers to murderers, naturists, pornographers, suffragists and queer couples.Lexicographer Sarah Ogilvie dives deep into previously untapped archives to tell a people's history of the OED. Here, she reveals, for the first time, the full story of the making of one of the most famous books in the world - and celebrates the extraordinary efforts of the Dictionary People.‘Unmissable’ Stephen Fry'A delight' Katherine Rundell‘Illuminating’ Susie Dent'Brilliant' Philippa Perry'Enthralling' Jeanette Winterson'An astonishing book' Sunday Times** A Financial Times, TLS and Daunt Books Book of the Year **2023 Sarah Ogilvie (P)2023 Penguin Audio",
