  "description": "During Heavenâ€™s rebellion, the angel Renat fell to Hell for loving the angel Emiel more than God. His punishment was harsh: he became a demon. Millennia later, Renat has long given up hope on ever reuniting with his love, finding what little pleasure can be found in the lands of the damned. He's shocked when an angel is found at the borders of Hell, and he quickly realizes that Emiel has finally followed him into Hell. Renat knows he will have to fight to keep Emiel from being torn from him, and the only one who can save them is Satan himself.(Part of the Goodreads M/M Romance Group's Love is Always Write event.)",
