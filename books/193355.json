  "description": "Dolly Parton once said,\" If you don't like the road you're walking, start paving another one.\" In the bustling city of Atlanta, four very different ladies take her advice to heart and open a catering business that will cater to themâ€”successful, independent women who put their families first.But flouting the traditions and expectations of Southern society turns out to be more complicated than they ever anticipated. Even as the pressure of running a business bonds them together, the realities of managing real life threaten to tear the whole thing apart. As financial woes, personal hurts, and family troubles test the strength of their business and their friendship, they discover that sisterly support and lots of heartfelt prayer just might be the only way to survive.Full of sass, grit, and good old-fashioned faith, How Dolly Parton Saved My Life is a hilarious and poignant look at friendship with a distinctly Southern flair.",
