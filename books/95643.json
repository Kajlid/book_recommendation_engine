  "description": "An alternate title/cover for this ASIN can be found here.A whole stadium of fans watched Sara turn down her boyfriend’s marriage proposal. Now Sara Jensen is ready to run away to the safety of her tiny community college and her quirky, but caring roommates. She meets a guy on her first day back, and sparks fly until she realizes his unfortunate family connections—her recent ex and new love interest are brothers.(Author's note: This is an LDS novel, meaning that there will be terms and situations common to members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints/Mormons. Regardless, the book doesn't take itself too seriously and I think it would be a fun read for anyone looking for a PG romance.)",
