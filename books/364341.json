  "title": "Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection",
  "description": "\"Kristeva is one of the leading voices in contemporary French criticism, on a par with such names as Genette, Foucault, Greimas and others. . . Powers of Horror is an excellent introduction to an aspect of contemporary French literature which has been allowed to become somewhat neglected in the current emphasis on paraphilosophical modes of discourse. The sections on CÃ©line, for example, are indispensable reading for those interested in this writer and place him within a context that is both illuminating and of general interest.\" -Paul de Man",
