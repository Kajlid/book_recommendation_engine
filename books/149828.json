  "description": "Cassie Johnson has a very unique gift. She can see the past, present, and future of people when she touches their hands. It is a gift she has had to deal with her whole life, and she has seen things she wished she hadn’t.Because she already knows what her dates are thinking and feeling, what they’ve done in the past, what their near future holds, relationships are difficult to come by. It is something that would put anyone off.She does like someone, though—very much. His name is Michael and he’s a police officer at the station where she works. The problem? He doesn’t bat an eyelid at her. In fact, she would go as far as saying that he hates her.However, when a new officer, Stephen, joins the force and seems to sweep Cassie off her feet, all that changes. For some reason, she cannot read him, and he quickly becomes a mystery that she needs to solve. Michael, on the other hand, doesn’t like it one bit and, pretty soon, jealousy rears its ugly head, leaving Cassie confused and frustrated.Later, Cassie learns a nasty secret, resulting in a shocking revelation regarding Michael and Stephen. Cassie soon realises that there are things beyond her world—beyond her imagination. Michael is her protector, her savior, her guardian. But can he keep her safe? Can she control her growing feelings for not only Michael, but Stephen? Can she make a choice? And will her choice result in the happily ever after she so desperately desires?",
