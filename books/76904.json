  "description": "A warm June morning at Aunt Karina's house suddenly turns cold. Thick white snowflakes start falling down and covering the ground. Ten-year-old Alex is surprised and delighted. He senses the approach of a new adventure. Together with his nine-year-old sister Katie, they rush into the winter forest in search of a little girl Masha. She is lost in an unexpected storm. They see her footprints in the snow and follow them. The wind is picking up, whistling through tree branches, creating white flurries on the ground and erasing Masha’s footprints. Will they be able to find Masha before the wind completely hides her path? \"Alex, look, there she is!\" Katie says. In the distance, a person dressed in a white sparkling coat and a silver hat is walking between the trees. Alex and Katie run as fast as they can. \"Masha!\" The person turns around. It’s not Masha. It’s a tall elderly man with a long white beard. In his right hand, he holds a staff. In his left, he carries a large sack adorned with white sparkling fur. His brows are furrowed, and his eyes look cold and unfriendly. \"Who goes here?\" the elderly man bellows. \"Why are you in my forest? Who invited you here?\" He opens his mouth and starts blowing cold air at the kids and at the path, sweeping away all the footprints. Alex shivers. He has never felt that cold in his life. Will he and Katie survive and make it back to Aunt Karina's house? And will they ever find Masha?",
