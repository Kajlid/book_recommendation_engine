  "description": "While on an archeological dig in Greece, Fiona McCarty finds a broken vessel depicting two attractive men performing a blatantly erotic act with a woman. The night Fiona sets in the final piece back together, she awakens to find two identically gorgeous men on either side of her bed. They are Castor and Pollux, the Gemini, trapped in the broken vessel for thousands of years by an evil demigoddess. By freeing them, Fiona earns their undying devotion.Fiona has her hands full trying to keep the fun-loving demigods out of trouble, and also trying to stave off the wild sexual attraction she forms-for both of them. Cas, the more serious and quiet, begins to teach her about slow sensuality. Pol, more outrageous and daring, teaches her erotic games she'd never known existed. Then Cas reveals he doesn't mind sharing-or watching-her with Pol, and Fiona revels in her newfound sexuality. But when the evil demigoddess returns for revenge, Fiona has to discover a way to keep the loves of her life free forever.",
