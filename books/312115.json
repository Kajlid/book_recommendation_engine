  "description": "Our worlds never should have collided, but it seemed our paths were always destined to cross. Brody McCallister was only supposed to be a means to an end. My golden ticket to get me closer to what I really needed—a way to make peace with what I’d done when I was eighteen, dirt poor, and left to fend for myself. I only had six weeks in the middle of a hectic world tour to do it. So the last thing I needed was to fall for a cocky cowboy. A walking contradiction with a charming grin, a dirty mouth, and a gift for healing wild and broken things. His life was in Texas. Mine was on the road.He guarded his privacy fiercely. I was constantly hounded by paparazzi.Everyone warned me it could never work, that ultimately I’d be forced to choose—my music career or him. I didn’t listen. I fell for him anyway. Hook, line, and proverbial sinker.  But Brody was hiding secrets. And when the storm finally broke, it destroyed everything in its wake ... including us.",
