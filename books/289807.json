  "description": "Long before there was an All-Royals Academy called Kingsbury Prep, there was the Kingmaker and her kings.  Violet Kingsbury was born to be a kingmaker. In a time when wars were common and thrones were fought after, the only name that could bring about peace...the only man that could trump the decrees of kings was Kingsbury. The Kingmaker.  But when the legendary Kingmaker is disposed, and the time of the Choosing has come, can the daughter of The Kingmaker rise to take the place of her father?  She is about to find out as the strongest, most capable, and most legendary princes across the lands come to challenge her for the Choosing.  Becoming Kingmaker, even as The Kingmaker's daughter, will not be easy in a male world where ladies were supposed to be damsels who needed saving.  To become Kingmaker, Violet will prove to all, especially the princes, that she's here to stay, and will be the one doing the saving.  **Kingmaker's Kiss is the second book in the Kingmakers of Kingsbury Series, a Reverse Harem Paranormal Fantasy Bully Romance with mixed genres elements, action, and mature scenes recommended for age 17 and up.",
