  "description": "When Junior Scribe Gareth is given the unenviable task of tracking down Keiran to inform him that he and his street performers are not to make themselves known during an important trade visit, he expects the task to be unpleasant. He does not expect to be intrigued by the mysterious, elusive man that is rumored to be a bastard prince, and whom many say would make a better king.  Neither does he expect that one frustrating meeting in the city slums would send him and Keiran stumbling into the path of a murderâ€”and a conspiracy to kill the king.",
