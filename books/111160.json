  "description": "Welcome back to the World of Weird. My name is Ember Blaylock. You can think of me as your supernatural tour guide.  Three months ago, I was just your average, ordinary, ghost-seeing, Senior in high school. I had sucky parents, awesome best friends, an annoying stalker, and a solid plan to get me far away from Moonlight, Missouri.  Then I fell in love with a vampire.  And found out I was a witch.  And banished a demon a couple of times.  And then, because the Bad Karma Fairy thinks I'm her personal plaything and loves to make me suffer...  I kind of died.  Now I'm sharing my body with a demon, my Prince Charming has turned into the Asshole King, I might be falling for one of my best friends, and there's a witch hunter who wants my head on a plate--or my butt tied to a stake.  Yeah, because I didn't have enough to do just being dead.",
