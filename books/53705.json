A struggling writer named Bill Finger was involved from the beginning. Bill helped invent Batman, from concept to costume to character. He dreamed up Batman’s haunting origins and his colorful nemeses. Despite his brilliance, Bill worked in obscurity. It was only after his death that fans went to bat for Bill, calling for acknowledgment that he was co-creator of Batman. Cartoonist and popular Batman artist Ty Templeton brings Marc Tyler Nobleman’s exhaustive research to life. Perfect for reluctant readers and those bridging from easy readers to longer narratives, this classic underdog story will inspire all readers to take ownership of, and pride in, their work.",
