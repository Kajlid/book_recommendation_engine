  "description": "Meet Nadiye Coskuner, a bright young college student, grown up on the tropical island of Bali, and singled out for a high school student exchange program to continue her studies in the U.S.A. When the book begins, she is looking forward to all the best that life can promise. And yet her path leads her unwittingly into the depths of depression and despair. This is the story of one girl’s quest for health in the face of formidable challenges. Faced with the insensitivity of businesslike medical professionals who ignore the biological and nutritional needs of their patient and rely heavily on prescription drugs, she has no choice but to endure the health-damaging side effects. Together with her family she leaves no stone unturned in seeking a sustainable solution for health. Follow Nadiye’s experiences and you will learn about the vagaries of the biochemistry of the human brain, and how it can lead us, unaware, into other realities and planes of existence. By charting these turbulent shores of the human mind that are shaped by the subtle imbalances of the biochemistry of the body and brain, she has prepared a valuable guide to others lost on their own dark shores. This book is full of wisdom, good advice and optimism that will benefit all those who read it; especially those who are struggling to recover from illness.",
