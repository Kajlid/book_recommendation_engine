Desperate to explore her erotic fantasies, she struggles to reconcile her faith in the man who has loved her from beyond the grave with the nightmares plaguing her mind. Will she learn the secrets he has carefully hidden and risk losing everything, or can their eternal love be the magic needed to give him a lasting redemption?",
