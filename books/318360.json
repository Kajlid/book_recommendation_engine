  "description": "No one’s upbringing is perfect, least of all mine. When your dad is more focused on rising up the ranks of the drug world than being a decent dad, you are exposed to some heinous things. Add in a horrendous time at school, and I couldn’t get out of Glasgow quick enough. I was never going back… Until Toby came crashing into my life. Secrets, lies, and betrayal consume me. I can let the past and future destroy me or fight back. This time, I choose to fight.",
