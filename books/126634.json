  "description": "The Jewish people, gazing down the vista of time, had longed for the rebirth of their nation. That day was now upon them, but could they endure its accompanying fury? The first two books in THE ZION CHRONICLES, The Gates of Zion and its sequel, A Daughter of Zion , graphically portrayed the courage and hope of the Jewish people streaming into Israel after the Holocaust. The drama of history and the heart-stopping life-and-death struggle of a nation are captured by bestselling author Bodie Thoene in the lives of the people who live on these pages. The Return to Zion opens during the final month of British occupation in Palestine. With Moshe the target of a dangerous conspiracy and Rachel imprisoned behind the walls of the Old City, David and Ellie marshall efforts in the last-ditch attempts of the Jewish Agency to arm its people against the onslaught that surely will come on the day the British forces leave Palestine. ENGULFED IN DARKNESS AND HOPELESSNESS, THEY WONDERED WHAT DIFFERENCE THE PROMISES TO ISRAEL MADE NOW?",
