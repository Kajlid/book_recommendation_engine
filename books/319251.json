  "description": "Sometimes it’s safer to stay dead—it’s easier to dig for the truth.I’ve got a man handcuffed to my bed.I’m Harper Finn, legit business owner. But I picked up a ringing phone that wasn’t mine and…well, I’m now involved.Sure, Grey Walker, six feet of blue-eyed hotness, will gripe about me kidnapping him when he wakes up. But I couldn’t just let the ex-cop fall prey to a hit someone took out on him. Trust me, with people setting him up to take the fall for an infamous murder, he’s better off pretending to be dead for a while. In south Florida, it’s easier than you might think.And as we dig for the truth, we have to be careful not to wind up at the bottom of Biscayne Bay.",
