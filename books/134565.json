  "description": "When Willow Creek Junior High School gets its own radio station, The Saddle Club goes on the air! Hosting a call-in show, however, is a lot more difficult than they ever imagined. At first, nobody calls. Then Stevie's brother Chad gets his friends to call with silly questions. The problem is the girls can't tell which questions are serious and which ones aren't. Then a caller tells them about a horse in trouble. Is the call for real? Or is Chad up to his old tricks again? The Saddle Club has to find out and save a horse before it is too late.",
