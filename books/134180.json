  "description": "This is a large onion of a haunted house story set in Kyoto, Japan in the winter of '92--'93. Lulla, an American exchange student, thinks she's landed a deal renting a place in the historic district of Gion. While her Japanese is above average, she misses the nuances between \"historic house\" and \"house with a history\". Though she's the only one paying rent, she will hardly be alone.",
