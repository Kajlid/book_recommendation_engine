A product of an environment I ve been trying so desperately to escape. Who am I? I m the graffiti on a subway, I m the pages of your journal, I m the voice for the child who wants to scream but can t because they re afraid. I m my father s daughter, my brother s sister, my mother s daughter; I m Asjiah Cappelli and this is my story.",
