  "description": "He doesn’t want a woman in his bed or need a permanent one in his life. He’s happy with just his sons and his business. He keeps his sex life separate from his family life and that suits him fine. Until….Vladimir Petrov’s night out should have been just that, a night out at his club with his sons and a couple of friends to celebrate his birthday. It turns into so much more.She doesn’t want another man in her life. She’d rather be at home or at the gym as she recovers from the humiliation of her ex-husband’s infidelity. Happy with her circle of friends she calls family, that’s enough for her or so she thinks. Until….Holly Spencer’s night out with the girls is one that she will never forget. Not that she wants to.His touch ignites a flame in her that only he can put out. His words seduce her as they strip her of any doubt of how much he desires her. All six-foot three, dark blue eyes, tattoos and that scar doesn’t intimidate her, like it should. She sees the man under his hard exterior. His solid chest and strong arms hold her safe within them and there’s nowhere else she would rather be.Her laugh startles him as her smile captures him, innocent with a touch of mischief. Her sapphire eyes call to him as they see straight through into the darkness of his soul. Tender and sweet he should run and leave her alone, but he would rather take his last breath than not have her slender body in his arms.From two different worlds but they fit together perfectly. But Vlad has a past. A dark past. As he tries to bury it deep within him, it festers and stews as his love grows stronger for the woman, he calls his angel. Until it seeps out into their relationship.",
