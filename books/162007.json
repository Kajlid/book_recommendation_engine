One was my light and the other pulled me into darkness.This isn't the story of how I was taken captive.

He was the son of the VP. Everyone but us thought we were made for each other. I couldn't believe how stupid they were until the night I finally saw the boy I grew up with as the man he'd become...The night everything in my world changed...The night I met him.Damien thought he'd saved me. Instead, he sealed my fate.",
