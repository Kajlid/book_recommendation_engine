  "description": "Kath Walker (Oodgeroo Nunukul) spent her childhood with her family on Stradbroke Island, off the Queensland coast. The first half of this book, 'Stories from Stradbroke', describes episodes from her childhood days - some happy, some sad - and gives a memorable impression of Aboriginal life on the island and of a family proud of its Aboriginal heritage. The second part of the book, 'Stories from the Old and New Dreamtime', is made up of Aboriginal folklore which the author recalls hearing as a child, and of new stories written in traditional Aboriginal forms.",
