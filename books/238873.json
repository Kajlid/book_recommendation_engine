  "description": "Luc Avila's been searching for his parents with his twin brother Marc for as long as he could remember, and he won't stop until he knows the truth of their disappearance. When one of his pranks accidentally goes wrong, Dane King, the leader of the American Dragons threatens to make him territory bound. Now Luc has to be careful - he can't afford to be territory bound. Especially not when the pretty little intern at the new Guardians of Existence facility has captured his dragon's attention. There was just too much for him to lose.  The summer internship at the Guardians of Existence facility was just one of Anya's steps towards her goal of uniting the dragons with all of America. Although it was the 21st century, the dragons of America were still exposed to prejudice, and hate. Her father argued that they'd given themselves a bad reputation, one that she felt was wrongly deserved. Now she was finally on the right track to achieve her goal and she wouldn't let anyone stop her. Especially not agent Howard Beauchamp who couldn't seem to get it through his thick skull that she didn't want to go on a date with him.  This is a spin off series of Emilia's Fated Dragons series, however it can be read as a standalone. Warning: This series contains lots of sexy shifter action, irresistible mates and steamy love scenes. Tons of mouth watering Paranormal Romance bonus content included!",
