  "description": "Every villain is the HERO of their own story... Fifteen-year old Catarina Perez wakes up in one of the city’s alleys covered in blood and lying next to the corpse of a man she has never met before. And it turns out that isn’t the strangest thing she’s going to go through this night. Within hours of waking up, her body begins to develop superhuman abilities that cause her to become faster, stronger and more agile than any person she’s ever met. But the use of these new powers brings with them a horrifying handicap: an uncontrollable desire to feast on the sweet, red nectar that is the life force of other humans. The more she uses her powers, the greater her desire to attack people. With her moral beliefs telling her that suicide is the greater sin, she tries to make peace with her need to feed on humans as a way of sustaining herself. Determined to see her affliction as a blessing and not a curse, Catarina begins to systematically hunt down the city’s drug dealers. If she has to feed, then it should be from those who deserve it most. With the hope of meeting a glorious death in battle and having her curse end, she instead becomes more powerful with each dealer she destroys. But power corrupts, and for Catarina, absolute power is bound to get somebody killed.",
