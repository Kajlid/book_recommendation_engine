  "description": "Marya Helwe is twenty-one, but she’s never had a boyfriend. She’s never been past second base for that matter. Her over-protective Syrian parents have ensured she’s stayed as sheltered as possible, despite the fact Marya is American born and raised. But Marya manages to convince her parents to let her go on an archeological dig in Jordan, and she’s determined to make the most of her first taste of independence.Almost instantly, Marya finds herself drawn to two very different Ash, a wealthy and dashing Jordanian, is exactly the kind of guy Marya’s parents would have hand-picked for her; and Luke, an American archaeologist with a “bad boy” streak and a mysterious link to the ongoing Arab Spring. Ash pursues her, while Luke tries to avoid her, and as Marya untangles her feelings about both men, as well as herself, she catches the fever for freedom.",
