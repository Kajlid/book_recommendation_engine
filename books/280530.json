  "description": "Upon her husband’s death, Miranda is blindsided to find out her reputation as a London prostitute has caught up with her in her adopted country. Battling the demons that threaten to destroy all that she has fought to overcome by marrying well, Miranda decides to use the skills she learned in her former life and turns her home, the only thing untouched by her late husband’s debt, into an elite brothel.Stranded in Dun Glen where the only person she knew is dead and with no money to return home, Hazel must find a place to stay while she figures out what to do next. In a mining town where most residents live in dusty tents and lean-tos, Hazel is directed to Miranda’s sprawling Victorian home in the hopes that she will allow her to board until she can find passage back to Illinois. However, her father assured her under no circumstances would she be welcomed home if she went through with her plans to marry herself as a mail-order bride after rejecting the arranged marriage to her father’s business associate, three times her age.Competing against the saloon keepers already established in Dun Glen, Hazel and Miranda have to fight to succeed and, at times, even for their lives. The two women forge a close bond and make a family of their eclectic house of disreputable, but lovable, employees. Will they succeed or will they be run out of town on a rail for defying the social and legal norms set forth by the traditional society of the late 19th century. The House on the Hill shines a light on the double standard surrounding the ways and means men and women have been allowed to make a living in the eyes of society and the law with honesty as well as humor.",
