  "description": "*Selected to the Outstanding Science Trade Books for Students K-12 for 2017 list, a cooperative project of the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) and the Children’s Book Council* *Selected by Chicago Public Library Best Informational Books for Younger Readers of 2016* Wombat poos are box-shaped to stay where they're deposited and serve as messages to other animals. Baby golden tortoise beetles pile poop on their backs to create a shield as protection from predators.  Silver-spotted skipper caterpillars can shoot their poops 40 times their own body length to conceal their true locations.  Baby hoopoes squirt their poops into the eyes of attackers -- and who wants feces in their faces?  Baby Ozark blind cave salamanders use gray bat guano for food.The bottom (!!) Ever-inventive nature finds a thousand uses for poop.  Nothing goes to waste (!!).  This book is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser with a lot of information to share.",
