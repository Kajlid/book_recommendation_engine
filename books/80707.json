There are lines that probably shouldn't be crossed, doors that should stay shut, thoughts that shouldn't be considered. In these three novellas by Stephen Graham Jones, the dead talk, ancient evil opens its eyes, and that guy across the parking lot, he's watching you, and has been for a while now.Lock the door, tell yourself it's nothing, turn the radio up. It won't matter. You're already three miles past where you meant to stop.",
