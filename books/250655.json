  "description": "A Romantic Dreamer Letty Gonzalez is a true romantic. She's spent her life waiting for flowers, poetry, the grand gesture that will finally sweep her off her feet--without any luck. After her latest dating fiasco, she's ready to give up on the idea of Prince Charming--but not on down and dirty fantasies about her new boss--gorgeous, out-of-her-league Max Delgado. A Restless Romeo Max is more pragmatic than romantic--and with his looks and charisma, beautiful women usually fall at his feet. Bubbly, generously curvy Letty just isn't for him, and maybe if he finally lets his grandmother set him up with someone new, Letty will finally believe it. A Sultry Surprise But the senior citizen's matchmaking is trickier than anyone anticipated. And when Letty and Max find themselves stuck in Key West together for a seductively sexy weekend, one kiss is enough to light a fire neither of them wants to put out . . .",
