  "description": "Charlie - It all began when I saw him in a red Chevy parked at the edge of a cliff. Xander. I was lost...and he was a lost soul. He drove me home, and before he disappeared into the dead of the night, he dropped a bombshell on me. Then he left, and it left me reeling, wondering whether he had made it through the night...and the summer. Until I saw him on my first day of school, and from that day, everything he did consumed me. He was the type of guy that could make you fall in love with just a look, but when he broke your heart, it would take a miracle to heal. Could I trust him? I wanted to. But trust came hard when you loved a boy with secrets and walls he couldn't seem to move to let you in. I knew all this, and still made his secrets mine and my heart his. I would trust him, I would wait. But when he eventually exposed the skeletons in his closet, would I stay? I wanted to. Xander - I met her at the end of the end of a long day, at the edge of a cliff that marked the end of my hometown's boundaries. The end of everything. This wasn't the time to meet a girl and fall in love, to trust a stranger and care about another person's safety. God knows what had happened the last time someone had trusted me to protect them and keep them safe. But that was a wound I wouldn't open, no matter how often I found myself trailing her wild scent and getting lost in her beautiful eyes. There were problems that love couldn't fix...hell, it caused some of them. And there were secrets that no one could handle, even if they were so deep in love. Could I keep those secrets and still protect what we had? I had to.",
