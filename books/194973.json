  "description": "Since her Awakening, seventeen-year-old Gabrielle Fiori has known the devil wants her as his own, and that when she dies, he’ll finally lay his claim. Evading death should be easy. But when a prophecy linking her to the lord of the underworld is leaked, supernaturals—both good and bad—come together for one to kill her, the girl they believe is the anti-Christ. Andre de Leon, Gabrielle’s soulmate and the king of vampires, will do anything to save her from a fate that’s been predestined for thousands of years. Even if that means killing. Even if that means dying. But Gabrielle harbors a death is only a matter of time. The magic that flows through her veins, changing her from human to vampire, is killing her. Her heart is slowing, her lungs strain for breath, her body sickens. The world has forsaken her, and unless fate can save her, she’ll be damned to hell and the devil that waits for her. And this time, it’ll be for good.",
