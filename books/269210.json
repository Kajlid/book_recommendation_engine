  "description": "From USA Today bestselling author Willow Winters comes a heart-wrenching, edge-of-your-seat gripping, romantic suspense.  I should feel shame for not wanting this to end, but he doesn’t want it to end either. When the darkness sets in, the flames all flickered out, and the loud click of the locks signal it’s over, that’s when reality comes back. The war. The drugs. All of the lies that leave a tangled web for me to get lost in. I don’t want any of it. I only want him. Jase Cross. My enemy. And yet, the only person I trust. With broad shoulders and a smoldering look in his dark eyes, Jase is a man born to be powerful. I shouldn’t give him more power than he already has. Jase Cross will be my downfall.",
