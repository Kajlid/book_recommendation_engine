  "description": "He’s an actor in need of an image makeover. She’s determined to show her ex-fiancé that she’s moved on. A fake relationship between two best friends is the perfect solution. Or is it?Reese Murphy has been my best friend since before we took our first steps.She’s the yin to my yang.The peanut butter to my jelly.It’s all platonic, of course, as we made a pact years ago that we’d never cross the line.But then she took a job abroad and moved away for a year.To say I’ve been lost without her would be a massive understatement.She’s finally coming home, and I couldn’t be happier about it.And then she presents me with a proposition...Pretend to be her boyfriend.I am an actor, after all, so it should be a piece of cake. It’s all part of her grand plan to show her ex-fiancé that she’s moved on.My agent wants me to clean up my image, so it would be a win-win for both of us.But then she moves into my house and prances around in those tiny pajama shorts.There's also the night she catches me alone in the bathroom in a compromising position.And she isn’t in any hurry to leave.We get lost in the moment and now I can’t think of anything else.We are way past a gray area at this point.We’ve entered a smoking-hot-I-think-I-might-be-in-love-with-my-best-friend area.The problem is, she still thinks we’re fake dating.And I stopped faking it a long time ago.",
