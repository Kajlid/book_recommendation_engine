  "title": "Country Doctor: Tales of a Rural GP",
  "description": "Have you ever wondered how to placate an enraged patient looking for his wife in your bathroom at three in the morning, or what to do with an unidentified corpse in front of a Devon cowshed when the herd is due in for milking? How do you set about returning fifty sets of dentures to their rightful owners after they have become jumbled together in the nursing home oven and just how should you deal with a drug runner rescued from the Caribbean Sea when he pulls a gun on you? And finally just how would you feel if one of your patients was abducted by aliens?Doctor Michael Sparrow has stumbled across the answers to these and other such thorny questions through personal experience, on his climb up - and not infrequent slide down - the greasy pole to medical success. Along the way he has amassed a collection of true stories detailing some of the humorous, bizarre, macabre and tragic incidents which occur in any doctor's life, but which seem especially destined to happen to him.From the delivery of a baby when under the influence to the unusual whereabouts of a jar of English mustard, this is the story of one GP's often fumbling attempts to make sense of the career he has unwittingly found himself in.",
