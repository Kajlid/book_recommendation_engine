  "description": "In a rough-and-tumble shantytown of shattered dreams and empty pleasures, one man would move mountains to win a woman's heart. . . .Sold into sin as a child, beautiful, tormented Angel never believed in love. Then Michael Hosea walked into her life. He was a simple man, strong as the rich earth he farmed. And though Angel fought his tenderness tooth and nail, Michael made her his wife. Through days of hardship and toil and starry nights of shared solitude, he opened her eyes to life's sweetest blessings and slowly melted the ice from her heart. Welcomed by a neighboring family of settlers, Angel discovered a close-knit warmth she'd never known. But there were others who could not forget--or forgive--the woman Angel once was. Now in the teeming city of San Francisco, a difficult destiny awaits her. To be worthy of the husband she adores. Angel must face--and conquer--the darkest demon of her past. . . .",
