  "description": "1931. This work presents 150 hymns as studies, interpretations, syntheses, bases actual worship procedure, pictorial life of the past and present, to arouse lethargic congregations, ministers, song leaders and organists, to a discovery and appreciation of, and enthusiasm for, hymns. Every legitimate device has been used to stir the imagination, strengthen the will to sing, and so live out the teachings of Jesus and follow his torch bearers who in all ages have sung the faith that was in them.",
