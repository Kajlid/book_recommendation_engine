  "description": "The job was decapitate the zombie, get paid, get out. Warlock Marcus Shifter followed the plan perfectly.The corpse, however, did not.Now there's a body on the loose, accusations of illegal necromancy are flying, and the answers are waiting in the perilous alleys between the mortal and paranormal worlds. They're no place for someone who mostly gave up magic after a childhood accident. And given his tendency to shoot off his mouth and his Glock, Marcus is having a hell of a time digging up more than just bodies.When an apocalypse-minded megalomaniac threatens Marcus's family, things get personal. Marcus will have to embrace the magic he's been avoiding for yearsâ€”and even that might not be enough to save the world from a hellish demise.86,000 words",
