  "description": "One night.That was our agreement. No strings, no attachments.Suffering from career suicide, I was more than ready to hide out in my Boston hotel room before returning home to my small town in Maine. Instead, I found myself standing face to face with a stranger. He was arrogant, impulsive, and impossibly gorgeous. Perfect for one night of fun, an escape from the reality that was my life. All it took was one bottle of wine and shared secrets between us for him to see me. Then the call came offering a second chance, injecting life back into my already flat-lined career. Discover who America's Rock God, Spencer Ryan, truly was and tell his story. Except when those electric blue eyes caught mine and I reached out to shake his hand, I already knew.My one-night stand was returning for an encore on who could be the more miserable idiot between the two of us. Let the show begin.",
