With the Voronin brothers.By their sides.In their beds.A part of their lives.But none of it was real. Malice, Victor, and Ransom showed me a side of myself I never knew existed, taught me to embrace the darkness I once tried to hide from…. and then proved that they see me the same way everyone else does.They lied to me. They used me.And now it’s not just my heart that’s in danger.It’s my life.Beautiful Devils is a full-length new adult romance with dark themes, damaged anti-heroes, and high heat.
