  "title": "Muscle Bound",
  "description": "Unlike so many of his gay buddies who fantasized about finding a dream lover, Chase Hyde had no plans to settle down. Being in top shape allowed him to cruise West Hollywood for exhilarating muscle sex with one hot bodybuilder after the next. A devout, self-acknowledged \"roamosexual\", his foremost objection to settling down was that having a partner would take him off the market. So even if love was never in the air, lust was always just around the corner. Chase expected to continue his carefree lifestyle until, through a correspondence in cyberspace, he met Hunter Rowe, an up-and-coming Madison Avenue advertising executive and fellow bodybuilder who pined for a long-term relationship. Driven by their passion for muscle, the two men form an instant, powerful connection and dive into an intense, long-distance love affair. Neither Chase nor Hunter can imagine the twists of fate that await in Muscle-Bound, a passionate tale about the turbulent pursuit of sexual conquest set against the world of muscle obsession, gym addiction and steroid abuse.",
