  "description": "Quinton Veal’s fourth book of poetry, Fire and Desire, doesn’t disappoint but delivers the sensuous, luscious verse he’s known for. Poems like “Human Art” will lead readers to their most “secluded private” zones, and “Make it Rain” will take them up the “cloud nine express highway.”Come into Brother Erotik’s garden once more, and experience delicious poetry to titillate the mind, body and soul.Cover art and design by Quinton Veal.",
