  "description": "96 pages of a gay comic strip-that's something you can leaf through rather quick, one should guess. But things are a bit different when it's about BIKE BOY, the X-rated graphic story book by Swiss comic artist ZACK. His juicy and heavenly horny stories are so - inspiring that you'll have difficulties to read only one of the three short stories from the beginning to the end, without starting to - ah, let's forget about this. Reducing Zack's comics just on the one thing would mean to ignore his fantastic drawing style and this arty, nostalgic look that makes us feel like little boys again. BIKE BOY really is something for the heart and the pants!",
