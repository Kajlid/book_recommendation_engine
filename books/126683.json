She suffered tragedy at a young age then spent the next eleven years in and out of hospitals fighting an illness doctors couldn’t identify while watching her mother make sacrifices to take care of her. When Ivy finally gets better, she resigns herself to the fact that she can either have health or love, always afraid that the illness will return. Ivy never wants to burden anyone again, so she makes sure to keep everyone at arm's length. That is until Fate intervenes and puts her on a collision course with a gorgeous, charismatic Hunter who makes her blood burn and her heart skip a beat whenever he's near. Her biggest battle, however, may be learning that she’s worth saving.FATE’S BIGGER PLAN…Christian Chiasson dreamed of finding his soul mate - until the night his parents died.
