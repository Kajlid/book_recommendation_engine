  "description": "This macabre adventure abounds with non-stop creepiness and features a memorable crew: a vicious hyper monkey, plagues of locust, museums of human legs, and a tomato-growing, one-eyed giant with a deliciously evil plan. The story's narrator is trapped in a nasty hole with the strange Mr. Flex who recounts the quest of Twig to restore the sight of his friend, Onus. With the help of Twig's sister's ghost, Isis, and the green-haired, tattooed punker, Clay, the boys set out to find the magic tomato of Arugula and must defeat the evil intentions of the villainous leg collector William Ernest Fang.",
