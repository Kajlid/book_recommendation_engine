  "title": "Malcolm Ardon... Mr Viagra",
  "description": "If there's anything Malcolm Ardon could wish for, it would be a thing called acceptance. All his life he's struggled to find a real friendship, let alone hold one down, which has resulted in his non-existent love life taking a hammering too. Malcolm's problem is, he's a nerd. He's dresses like one, he acts like one and because he prudishly replaces expletives with strange childish words, he comes across like one too. On the upside, he's well mannered, positive, friendly, and in-fact a true gentleman. Question is, who is going to like or fall in love with a man, who adores his dead end job more than life itself and lives his life by dull routine?  Enter his boss Mr Hunt, wannabe gangster Dexter, a receptionist called Sally, a dippy school teacher named Candy and Mrs Pufflewoo, his eighty-eight year old neighbour.  Once Mr Hunt has set him up on a blind date, insisting he take a small blue pill to enable his night to go smoothly, all hell breaks loose when Malcolm wakes in the morning to find his medically enhanced sausage hasn't deflated, yet got bigger. This brings him friends, women and plenty of attention, but at what disastrous cost?",
