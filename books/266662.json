It’s been a long time since I’ve read a fantasy novel that I became emotionally invested in and kept me up late reading. The plot is a fun can-they-save-the-world adventure and this second book was just as good as the first.\" Megan, Goodreads Reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\"An excellent continuation of the series. I can't wait to Read the third book. There were a lot of character groups going on different directions to do their part. I loved it though.
