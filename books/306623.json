  "description": "Escape or die. The man I loved is a liar, a predator who lured me in with sweet words and empty promises. Now, I’m trapped and it’s only a matter of time before he loses control. I have one chance to run. Head for the wilds and don’t look back. If I leave, I might die, but he’ll kill me if I stay. For so long it’s seemed like I’m destined to spend my days in hiding; scared and alone. But when a freak accident sends a pack of shifters crashing into my path, I catch a glimpse of a life worth living. Can I find the Love and safety I crave with three men the rest of society considers threats? And will the monster that hunts me ever let me go?",
