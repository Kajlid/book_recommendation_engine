  "description": "Abdu'l-Baha in America recounts the journey of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the eldest son of Baha'u'llah and appointed head of the Baha'i Faith after his father's passing, across much of the United States in 1912. His exhausting yet exhilarating 239-day trek from coast to coast took him to fifty cities and towns, where he delivered up to four talks a day-- about four hundred total- - to approximately 93,000 people on Baha'u'llah's message of the oneness of humanity and the principles of universal peace. This historic visit to the United States planted the seeds that would take root and germinate into the present-day American Baha'i community.",
