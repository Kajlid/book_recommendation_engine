  "description": "Tommy has lost his wife, children, job, savings -- basically his whole world. Nothing seems to go his way. Trying to change his life, he becomes a poker player. Tommy wins a very heated poker game against the son of a Chicago Mafia kingpin in Lake Tahoe. Then he joins up with the son's hooker, who knows a few too many dirty little secrets about Chicago. A hit man is sent to kill the woman by the son's father. After he fails and is killed, she and Tommy are forced to flee to Las Vegas. But the mob has placed a huge bounty on their lives. They team up with the hooker's pimp and a police detective from Tahoe. Will they outsmart and escape the mobsters or are their lives fated to be ruled by \"Murphy's Law\"? Charles Hardman lives in Walnut Creek, California, where he is working on his second book. Publisher's Web",
