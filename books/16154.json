  "description": "Rest and relaxation--that's what Nita thinks she's going to get when her little sister, Dairine, signs her up for a wizardly \"cultural exchange\" program, sending Nita and her partner-wizard Kit halfway across the galaxy over spring break. But nothing about wizardry--not even vacation--is ever quite that simple. Back home, Dairine and her dad have to cope with their side of the three young wizards who've just moved in and are eager to start experiencing a strange alien culture . . . Earth.",
