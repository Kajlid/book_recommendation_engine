  "description": "“In a series of short, sly, ironic essays...[the authors] invert, deflate, and dismantle most of the aesthetic fads of our time....Domecq is a seedy literary journalist....a pompous, brainless critic of every art in sight. He is hilariously awful and a great creation.” The Atlantic Monthly“The real target of [the authors’] often uproarious gibes is modernism--or the part of it that zealously pursues theories of ‘pure’ form into Cloud-Cuckoo-Land. The result, which Domecq never perceives, is invariably monstrous: novels and poems that cannot be read, art that cannot be seen, architecture--freed from ‘the demands of responsibility’--that cannot be used....With donnish humor and unfailing intelligence, Chronicles of Bustos Domecq thrusts a rapier into such gargantuan posturing.” Time",
