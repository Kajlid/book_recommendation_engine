  "description": "Imagine feeling so desperate that you make a radical decision that will drastically change the course of your life and the lives of each of your children in a way you can't fully comprehend. Logic screams, \"This will never work!\" But, shrouded in your idealistic dream, you ignore the clear warning, hoping that just maybe, this last, frantic measure will stem the tide of impending implosion and save your family.It's one thing to peer at an Amish story-book with a distant admiration and wonder at the people who live their lives separated from mainstream society. It's another matter, entirely, to step out of that mainstream and pursue becoming one of the plain people. Cherrie McBurney did just that and would come to realize there was just no way to paint her family into a picture perfect, Amish-flavored setting. Not even a set of hand-made rocking chairs direct from an Amish man's barn could fill the canvas of her home with the warmth of a Norman Rockwell scene.Moving from beloved sister to the ranks of the expelled unleashed a furious hurricane in her family. The ensuing painful years brought spiraling devastation that she prayed they would survive. More than a decade post-hurricane, a certain peace, understanding and acceptance of the painful years are just in the rearview. In this poignant story of redemption, Cherrie's message is one of surprising discovery that hope and even joy can emerge through the darkest places of our brokenness as we lean in to the One who is able to say to the raging storm within, \"Peace! Be Still!\"You'll laugh, cry and be inspired as you join Cherrie on her personal journey to discover your own constant covering.",
