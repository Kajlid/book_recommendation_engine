  "description": "You've met Chance Bateman...Are you ready to meet his son??Some say I’m cocky — I say I’m confident. Things have always come easy for me; sports, academics…girls. And I’ve used all of that to my advantage the past three years of college.I’ve got it all, or at least I thought I did until Laken walks into my life.I’ve never had a desire to let another person into my life like my parents’ relationship, but there is some mysterious pull I feel toward this brunette I’ve noticed around campus.And with each interaction we have, I long to know her more. Yet the closer we get, the harder she resists and the higher the walls go up.I sense there’s something more – a secret she’s hiding – one she doesn’t trust to share with me yet.But she will, if I have my way, and I’ll do anything if she’ll take a chance on me. On us. I grew up hearing the story of how my parents met, their separation, how my dad fought for them, and they're happily ever after. I just never expected or wanted to find that for myself.Now that I have I don’t want to ever let them go. But when I’m given the opportunity of a lifetime after graduation, will the offer of my heart be enough for her to accept? Or will I lose her forever?",
