From the moment he stumbled into her presence, he knew she was his One. Every time he came near Asa he fell apart. Whether it was being tongue tied and muttering with a self-inflicted speech impediment or his legs finding ways to make him look like he had two left feet and backward kneecaps, Charleston was a discombobulated time bomb waiting to embarrass himself. He loved her and would tell her, that is if he could get his mind and body to cooperate.Who knew adulting could be this hard?Every time she thought she was getting a handle on her life, the wind shifted pulling her deeper into the abyss. She was drowning from her financial life to her personal life – hell even her body had gone on strike was taking the last ship to shore.
