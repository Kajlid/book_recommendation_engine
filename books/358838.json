  "description": "FROM THE CRIME TO THE RIDICULOUSFrom the offbeat but razor-edged imagination of Spider Robinson: stranded time travelers; squabbling cosmic warriors; reincarnated rock stars; blind starship pilots; monsters both human and alien; tomorrows formed by today's trends -- this Spider weaves a web of wonder.Sound profound? Nah. Herein we've got a partially-disembodied Brooklynite looking for his, er, bottom half, a past-tense-ignoring player of a certain New York crap game from 1930 running loose in the present, a compendium of the silliest weapons history never had, and plenty more. The warped and the way-out combine in a book that by any name would be ... really cool.Contents:Melancholy Elephants (1982)Half an Oaf (1976)Antinomy (1978)Satan's Children (1979)Apogee (1978)No Renewal (1977)Tin Ear (1977)In the Olden Days (1984)Silly Weapons throughout History (1980) essayNobody Likes to Be Lonely (1975)True Minds (1984)Common Sense (1985)Chronic Offender (1981)High Infidelity (1984)Rubber Soul (1982)The Crazy Years (1996) essayBy Any Other Name (1976)",
