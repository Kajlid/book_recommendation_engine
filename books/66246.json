  "description": "For the first time in his life, Robert Ryder doesn't have orders. He has just buried his son Mark; his career in the French Foreign Legion is finished. Unable to settle into civilian life, he drifts to Thailand, where he learns of a man on death row for dealing with the same drug lords responsible for Mark's deadly overdose. However, the smugglers find Ryder before he can find them. Kidnapped to Burma, Ryder escapes and realizes his mission. Facing the reality of a growing drug culture and the greed that fuels it, Ryder aims to make peace with his past by exacting retribution in the best way he knows. With the vengeance of a father wronged and the precise brutality of a Foreign Legionnaire, Ryder infiltrates the organization. But the deeper he goes, the more familiar the faces become. \"Walk With The Devil is a scintillating fuel pumped thriller. A true in your face juggernaut of adrenaline, plotting and pace. Both a fascinating insider's view of The Legion, and a deeply moving compassionate examination of loss. This is thriller writing of the highest order and Tom Foote is the new name to reach for. Foote rules on just every level there is!\"--Ken Bruen \"Walk With the Devil is Tom Foote at the peak of his Powers! Read it!\"-Stuart Woods \"An old-fashioned, no-holds-barred revenge story.\"-Publishers Weekly \"A meticulously detailed and very exciting story of revenge. Think of Ryder as having the wrath of an Old Testament prophet and skills of a professional killer.\"--Irish AmNew",
