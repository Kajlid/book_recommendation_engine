  "description": "When Jenna Jenson is attacked by a man whose supernatural abilities supersede her super hearing, strength and abnormal reflexes, she is rescued by the demon king, Lucas Thaler, and powers she never knew she possessed are revealed. She discovers she is part of a new breed of immortals prophesied to evolve that could either save or destroy human life.After a war in his demon plane that killed his family, Lucas has dedicated his life to combating Malum Inmortalis, rogue immortals, whose goal is to rule immortals and mankind. The evil he has battled for centuries and his purpose is deferred when he hears Jenna's voice, the woman he has been waiting for centuries, the woman he's been dreaming of for centuries, his fated mate.** This is the first installment of the Elemental Sisters Series, but it can stand-alone. The second installment, Burdened by Desire, is available now and features Jenna's sister, Jocelyn and her mate.Lucas Thaler awoke in a panic, afraid he'd lost her once again. He had lost her, because it had only been a dream. Sweat prickled his skin; his body was soaked in his own fear. It had felt so real to him, but it had been an illusion, so similar to so many others, but still just his mind playing cruel tricks on him. He'd had another hallucination of the one woman who was so close yet so far away, a dream of the untouchable, elusive woman he'd sought for more than seven centuries.",
