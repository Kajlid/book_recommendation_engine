  "description": "Book Two in The Midnight Hunter Trilogy Donna is on the wrong end of a high-power assault rifle, with a 4000 year old demon’s trigger finger on the other. He’s promised to blow her brains out if she gets any closer. She takes a step…toward the monster. Until that day, Donna was enjoying her new life. Married to the man of her dreams, raising the child they had together, spending time with her best friend…what more could a girl want? How about a chance to save the world? The opportunity arrives when a strange, beautiful woman befriends Donna and then kidnaps her baby. To get her little girl back, Donna must do what’s humanly impossible...and maybe inhumanely impossible, too. With the help of a fallen Underworld goddess, a vengeful demon, and her own new-found strength, Donna must rescue her baby and the world.",
