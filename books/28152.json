His firestarter and telekinetic abilities have been honed to deadly perfection by the Resource, a shadowy anti-terrorist organization—the only family he has ever known.

He’s hot in more ways than one. And her first instinct is to rescue him from his insular existence.Her plan to kidnap and deprogram him goes awry when her latent telepathic ability flares, turning Alec’s powers off. Hoping close proximity will reignite his flame, she leads him by the hand through a world he’s never known. And something else Alec’s anger over everything he’s been denied. Especially the passion that melds his mind and body with hers.The Resource, however, isn’t going to let anything—or anyone—steal its prime investment. Alec needs to be reminded where his loyalties lie…starting with breaking his trust in the woman he’s come to love. Contains telekinetic sex, nuclear explosion sex hot enough to melt steel, and various and sundry swear words.",
