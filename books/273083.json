  "description": "In The Lost and Found Journal of a Miner 49er, Vol. 1, Jack Dublin charms us into a world of folklore stretching from the outback of Australia to the Island of California. Along the way, we encounter mythical creatures, from wish-granting mermaids and red-haired giants, to talking coyotes and a dreadful Canyon Sphinx. We relive exploits of powerful rulers and infamous outlaws, who (though their names be lost to history) entangle themselves in our memories with the likes of Abe Lincoln and Billy the Kid.  At times the stories echo the folksy muse of Mark Twain, while at others they resonate the full-bloomed fantasy of Hans Christian Anderson. By journal's end, we have wrestled a history far different from that taught in classrooms; but with our faith deepened, we press on... our imaginations ablaze for the next adventure.",
