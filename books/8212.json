  "title": "Remi's Pup",
  "description": "Drew was a hardworking, straight-A student until the night his ex-boyfriend saw something in him he shouldn't have. Drew's secrets led him to a life of drugs and pain, and the road to recovery will be long. Remi is the jokester of the pack, never taking anything or anyone too seriously--until he meets Drew. But Remi's first days with his mate are spent cradling Drew through his brutal withdrawals. To make things worse, tension runs high as the psychotic wolf, Jackson, still hunts for the mates. Facing up to his true identity could push Drew back to drugs. Can Drew get clean and allow Remi's love to save him from himself? And can fun-loving Remi stand up to his most serious challenge yet? Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
