  "description": "Once upon a time… The time had come for Princess Clarissa to find a husband—or so her parents told her. The shy and somewhat clumsy, Prince Ormond from a neighboring kingdom, is a contender. Clarissa knows she’ll never fall in love with him much less accept him as a husband. And yet… seemingly in a split second, she changes her mind.  Ryder Grey has known Clarissa since childhood and cannot understand the sudden change from the girl he once adored, to the woman he sees now. How can she be in love with the meek Prince Ormond? Ryder begins to investigate and discovers that a reclusive witch has Clarissa under a spell.  When Ryder interferes with Clarissa’s budding romance with Prince Ormond, she takes action and locks her childhood friend in a secluded tower in the east forest until she and Ormond can marry.  Forgotten in the tower by all but the rats can Ryder enchant Clarissa and break the sinister spell? His chances do not look favorable.",
