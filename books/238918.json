  "description": "His lips told me he knew me.His hands touched like we were old lovers.His eyes held secrets of a past I’d never known.I was lost, you see.Lost as the flowers that grew in the meadow.The devil told me he knew me.But lies had a way of unraveling, even if we didn’t want them to.The devil had a trick, for his love was full of acid. Acid that burned at every touch, every linger, and I let it scorch me to my core.A devil made you sin. And my devil was the worst.But now that devil wanted my last kiss, and it wasn't one I was willing to give.He could take the acid and leave the burn behind.I was keeping my heart even if I died trying.*Standalone*",
