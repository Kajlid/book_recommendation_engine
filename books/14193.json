  "description": "When the government needs a body double for a covert operation, they hire shape-shifter Charley Randall. For two centuries, sheʼs played every part from foreign dignitary to office drone. The role she wants most, though, is one sheʼs denied herself three times already. FBI Agent Wyatt Moreland believes Charleyʼs photographic memory is the key to his latest assignment. Heʼs oblivious to the true extent of her abilities, but he canʼt deny the sense of déjà vu at their introduction. Unlike Wyatt, Charley knows this isnʼt their first meeting. Itʼs their fourth. The girl he vowed to love, fifteen years before, stands in front of him in her true form—one heʼll never recognize. With each reconnection, Charley loves him more, though she realizes this is her last chance to explain. Only absolute truth can bring them happiness, but can Wyatt forgive her deceptions? Or will lies tear them apart forever?",
