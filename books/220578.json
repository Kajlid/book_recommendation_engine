  "description": "From the moment you are born, you are conditioned to know this truth: Unorthodoxy is wrong action, Heterodoxy is wrong thought. One will lead to your Detention. The other to your Execution.Two generations after the Execution of Kane 148 and Otpor's return to Orthodoxy, the Resistor's legacy still lingers. In this future, post-apocalyptic Paris, forbidden murals are appearing on crumbling concrete walls – calling citizens to action. Calling for Resistance.When Kane's former protege, Anaiya 234, is selected for a high-risk undercover mission, Otpor is given the chance it needs to eliminate the Heterodoxy and Anaiya the opportunity she craves to erase a shameful past.But the mission demands an impossible sacrifice – her identity.While the growing rebellion will change the utopian lives of all Otpor's citizens, for Anaiya it will change who she is. As the risk of violence escalates and every decision is fraught with betrayal, will Anaiya's fractured identity save her or condemn her?----- Winner of OneBookTwo Standout Award 2017. With this accomplished debut offering, Kopievsky presents a dark dystopian tale with complex characters, exquisite world-building and high tension.
