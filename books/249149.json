  "description": "Kate Tanner Was Hiding from Her Parent's Killers. She Never Expected to Find Romance Especially While Dressed as a Man.When Kate Tanner witnesses the murder of her parents, the wealthy Virginia Sen. Murphy Tanner and his wife, Abigail, she knows she needs to disappear - and fast - until the killers are behind bars. So she dons what she thinks is a foolproof disguise - masculinity - calls herself Billy Ingram, and travels to the country to find work. It's her way of laying low until justice is served, but it isn't long before she's getting more than she bargained for. Now, on a North Dakota farm, this former city girl struggles to convince her employer, the handsome Chad Walker, she has what it takes to handle demanding farm chores. Meanwhile, the men who killed her parents are searching for her, a woman named Lacy Montgomery is infatuated with her, and Kate's fallen in love with Mr. Walker. Then she's seen without her disguise - and the excuses start to really make things interesting. Can Kate survive long enough for the charade to reach a happy ending? In the spirit of Shakespeare's As You Like It, Ruth Ann Nordin's An Unlikely Place for Love might just convince you the oddest circumstances make the perfect settings for Romance.",
