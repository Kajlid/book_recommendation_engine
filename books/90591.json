  "description": "Winner of the National Book Critics Circle AwardThe cast of characters includes Hitler and Goering, Gertrude Stein and Marc Chagall--not to mention works by artists from Leonardo da Vinci to Pablo Picasso. And the story told in this superbly researched and suspenseful book is that of the Third Reich's war on European culture and the Allies' desperate effort to preserve it.From the Nazi purges of \"Degenerate Art\" and Goering's shopping sprees in occupied Paris to the perilous journey of the Mona Lisa from Paris and the painstaking reclamation of the priceless treasures of liberated Italy, The Rape of Europa is a sweeping narrative of greed, philistinism, and heroism that combines superlative scholarship with a compelling drama.\"Nicholas knows the art world as well as any military historian knows his battlefield.... Her work deserves the widest reading.\"-- New York Times Book ReviewFrom the Trade Paperback edition.",
