  "description": "Before heading off for college, sixteen-year-old small town girls Abby and Jamie are headed for the big cities! Shy, innocent Abby will be a nanny for a posh New York City family, while smart, no-nonsense Jamie works her nanny gig in sunny, celeb-studded L.A. Talk about culture shock. And, between the eye-popping parties, hot boys, high-maintenance kids, and a heaping of drama, the girls can barely squeeze in time for e-mail catch-ups. But their wild summers on opposite coasts will teach Abby and Jamie things they never knew about love, lust, truth, lies, themselves . . . and each other.",
