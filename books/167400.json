When a muscular hunk walks past her, Willow's mouth waters and she knows she's found the perfect man to ask her embarrassing question. Seth is shocked when a beautiful woman sits on his lap. He's amused when she begins asking him questions. But he's aroused when she kisses him. Taking her back to his home, he sinks his teeth into her-and is addicted. Imagine his surprise when he finds out she holds his life in the palm of her hands. What's a vampire to do when the woman he needs for his survival runs screaming from him? Warning, this title contains the following: explicit sex and graphic language.",
