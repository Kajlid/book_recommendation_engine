  "title": "Notes of Oisin: From an Irish Monk to a Skaldic Poet",
  "description": "A 15 years old Irish monk, Oisin, lives a pious life in a monastery close to the city of Dublin, and, in his free time, writes down some notes in his diary, describing his daily life.Oisin is quite different from the rest of his brethren. He has learned the Norse language from his mother who was once a captive in the far North, and, unlike many Irishmen, who despise the Norsemen for their pagan brutality, he is fascinated by the Norse language and poetry. He even composes little verses in Norse from time to time, albeit only as a hobby, for he has already accepted the life of a monk and spends most of the days following the strict monastery code.Everything changes, however, when the Northern raiders anchor at their shores.",
