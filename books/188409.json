Now Evan Ross is still getting used to the idea of living around, dating, and diving with mermaids. Between deep-sea dives for ancient animal bones and long, leisurely open-water swims, Evan and his extended family live a happy island life both above and below the water.But seas never stay calm for long.News of nearby freak storms and the disappearances of entire villages starts making waves around Andros Island. Before long, strange mermaids with their siren songs can be heard across the waterâ€”songs meant to lure humans to their death. And when an unruly shoal migrates his way, threatening the peace of his little paradise, Evan and his family must fight to save the island and the people who call it home.",
