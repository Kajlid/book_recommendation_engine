  "title": "Among Warriors: A Woman Martial Artist in Tibet",
  "description": "In the fortress that is Tibet no place is more remote than the province of Kham and no people more elusive than the Khampa, the fierce horsemen who for twenty-five years waged a relentless guerrilla war against the Chinese occupation. In Among Warriors , a different kind of warrior sets out to find the Pamela Logan, an American with a Ph.D. in aerospace science, and a third-degree black belt in karate. Logan cycles, hitchhikes, and treks across the windswept plateaus and icy mountain passes of eastern Tibet. She drinks tea with monks and herdsmen, dodges Chinese police, and watches in awe as religious pilgrims inch their way toward Lhasa by prostrating themselves at every body length. Writing with vast sensory power and sympathy, Logan produces a gem that will captivate those interested in Buddhism, the martial arts, and one of the world's last inaccessible regions.\"[Logan] writes of getting to Lhasa with all the wistfulness of Chekhov's three sisters dreaming of Moscow.\"--New York Times Book Review",
