  "description": "Raine Baumer is living the party life in Chicago, indulging in short relationships with little emotional commitment. But after he's severely injured in a gay bashing, close friend Geoff arrives to take him to the country to recuperate. There Geoff and his partner Eli treat him like part of the family, and Raine meets Jonah, Eli's brother, who is exploring life in the world outside his Amish community. Jonah and Raine's mutual attraction draws them together, but they may not have a chance to explore it. Jonah's father is making ultimatums, and the police believe that the attack on Raine may not have been as random as it initially appeared. Raine and Jonah will have to face what they fear most in order to have any chance at a life together.",
