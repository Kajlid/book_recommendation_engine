  "description": "It’s National Take Your Kids to Work Day and Tyger Pants, a typical 9 year old boy, should be looking forward to a day off school. But unfortunately his dad isn't a cool fire fighter and his mum isn't a policewoman. His dad’s a librarian - DULL!Dull that is until his dad is called away to an emergency meeting, leaving his uncharacteristically cool iRate3 phone lying on the desk. Tyger can’t help but fiddle…But the phone is really a top secret Library Service Editor and before Tyger knows what’s happening he’s plunged into a terrifying fantasy world of werewolves, dragons and spell casting armadillos. Cretin the Cruel and his Werebeast Army are about to invade and, if he ever wants to get home again, it’s up to Tyger to stop them.",
