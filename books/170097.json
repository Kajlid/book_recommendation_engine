  "title": "Keep Austin Weird: A Lesbian Superhero Love Story for Grown-Ups",
  "description": "Residents of Austin, Texas so value individualism, most (but not all!) of them rally around the phrase, \"Keep Austin Weird.\" In the midst of that off-kilter vibe are two mildly weird kindergarten teachers, Eleanor Cooprider and Kim Park. One of them possesses a superpower and the other recognizes superpowers in others (and she can talk to plants, though they never answer). Once they share this super secret, their mutual attraction blossoms into love, and there is nothing weird about that.To summarize this summary via the novel's lengthy subtitle (A Lesbian Superhero Love Story for Grown-Ups): Lesbian, because there are women loving women (but not a romance novel or erotica). Superhero, because of a single superpower (but not science fiction or fantasy). A Love Story - see Lesbian, above. And for Grown-Ups, because no one leaps tall buildings in a single bound or wears a crime-fighting onesie. But enough please turn to Page 1 and read the subsequent pages sequentially. Thank you for your cooperation.",
