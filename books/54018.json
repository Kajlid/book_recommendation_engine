  "description": "Beth Cochran has never known the true stability of a family. Her mother died shortly after her birth, and her father is perpetually absent and verbally abusive. Handsome bounty hunter, Tyson Seals, can't imagine going through any situation without his doting parents and bevy of siblings by his side. Feeling responsible for the death of the man everybody supposed Beth would marry, he's compelled to ask for her forgiveness. Their two very different cultures collide when excitement, complications, secrets, hidden and overt dangers litter their path. Will they discover how a common belief in Christ can bind them?",
