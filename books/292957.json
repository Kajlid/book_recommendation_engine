  "description": "Through the ages, dragons had gradually been tamed to be kept as pets before being hunted to extinction. These particular dragons - being bred with wings too small to lift their bodies, so that they were unable to fly away - were not always properly cared for by their owners â€“ and so the Dragon Sanctuary was created. The Dragon Sanctuary had been open for many years. When the old wizard had retired from wizardry he'd decided to look after sick and unwanted dragons and, of course, those that had been mistreated by previous owners. He never really expected to get too many dragons but, of course, he did. Luckily though, some got rehomed as pets (to careful owners), and others were adopted by those who hadn't got the room to keep a dragon themselves. The adoption scheme works very well because it helps with the upkeep of the dragons. Anyone can visit the Dragon Sanctuary, and those who have adopted do so very frequently. They often bring food for the dragons too. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dragon-Sanct...",
