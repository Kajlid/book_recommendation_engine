  "description": "'This chapbook is a concise commentary on everyday life with a penchant for stopping at the ugly parts; only to frame them in the tragically comic.' Amazon reviewerLiam Bates (known on Instagram and Twitter as @wordswithpurple) brings his unique poetic voice to bear on topics including WASHING UP, HAIRCUTS, SOCIAL OUTINGS and OUR ENDEMIC AND NAUSEATING DESPAIR.Perhaps the job of the poet is not to stir resistance, but just to provide entertaining commentary as we sink inexorably into our own sewage.Either way, the words are there for you to read.('microwave nouveau' received a special mention in the best pamphlet category for the 2019 Saboteur Awards)",
