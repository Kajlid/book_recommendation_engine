  "description": "Abigail \"Big Abby\" Wendell, a lone frontierswoman in the Dakota Territory, must acquire a husband or give up the homestead she established with her late father. The men in her small town have never been kind to her, but Abby isn't easily rattled. Both practical and stubborn, she posts an advertisement in want of a husband, and she gets far more than she bargained for.  Carl Brooks is a simple, rambling man who never took to book learning. Believing a family and land of his own was not in the cards for him; he was in for quite the shock when Abigail's advertisement found him in the midst of planning his next move. The promise of a real home is too good to pass up.  After some mishaps and miscommunication, Abby ends up married to the wrong man! Or perhaps, heâ€™s just the man she needs? When Carl makes his way to Abby; they find they have both met unexpected challenges on the long and dusty road to wedded bliss.",
