  "description": "Klein's debut fiction collection brims with images of boys and men who just don't fit in. They have acne; they are drag queens; they have club feet; they are social misfits; some even have AIDS. His variety of protagonists sheds new light on the role of the outsider in a society obssessed with beauty and sex.",
