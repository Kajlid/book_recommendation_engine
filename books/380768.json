  "description": "Many of the best English novels are portraits of families. In Brideshead Revisited Evelyn Waugh narrates the fortunes of the accomplished but eccentric family of Lord Marchmain in a social panorama that ranges from Oxford to Venice. His dissection of the moral infirmities of 'Society' is as sharp and candid as it was in Decline and Fall or Vile Bodies; but in Brideshead Revisited, the longest and most ambitious of his novels, he also reveals a deep concern and sympathy for the dilemma of the individual.This edition includes an explanatory preface added by the author in 1959.",
