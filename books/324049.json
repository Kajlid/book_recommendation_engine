  "description": "Alexander Pushkin (June 6, 1799 - February 10, 1837), is widely considered to be Russia's greatest writer.Â  He is credited with enhancing the Russian lexicon and introducing a language that, while bridging Romanticism with Realism, would become a foundation for Russian modern literature. His poetry, marked by innovative rhymes and rhythms, while, at the same time, maintaining natural tone and diction, has a very unique and distinct sound that is drastically different from anything written before him. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, has been recognized all over the world and translated into 86 languages, including at least 42 translations into English. This small, dual-language collection is an assortment of some of his best known poetry with some of the lesser known works.",
