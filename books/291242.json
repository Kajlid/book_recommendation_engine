  "description": "Pennsylvania. Spring. The radio station reports a fire outbreak near the trailer park. Francis' downfall begins when his housemate checks his white knight principle in order to save a divorce-tattered father. Losing a good friend to the state of Ohio is a real chipped tooth feeling, and Francis mends himself by getting to know Salem, a seventeen-year-old transfer student, who somehow manages to defenestrate Francis' ethics and morale. The existential terror snowballs when a farmhouse near Francis' neighbourhood is set on fire, and word spreads of an arsonist in town. A film festival deadline leering over the young cinematographer, Francis deems the local arson his new niche. But hidden behind the veil of \"artistic curiosity\", his research leaves him several steps ahead of the police, and Francis rapidly comes to conclude his new housemate just isn't who people think he is.",
