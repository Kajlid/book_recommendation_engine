  "description": "Never had Christina seen a man as handsome as the notorious pirate Justin Phillips. His lean, masculine frame radiated a shocking strength; his piercing blue eyes left her feeling helpless and weak. Somewhere deep inside her, the innocent beauty felt a yearning for an unknown ecstasy, and thirsted for adventures that were forbidden even in her dreams. But, as his lips gently grazed her flesh and his hands thoroughly ravished her senses, Christina resolved that after he had his way with her, she would flee under the cover of night and forever escape his ardent demands! He forced her response...There was nothing like a challenge to make the blood flow faster in Justin Phillip's veins. So, when the dashing pirate saw the timid wench shrink from his gaze, he decided that he'd take her with-or without-her consent. He coaxed desire from her pouting lips; he awakened passion with his expert touch. The experienced rake knew that Christina would try to run away from pleasure, but once he'd had her..he knew that he could never let her go. If it meant capturing her with kisses, and enslaving her with his caress, he would do it, and turn the seeds of her hidden desire into the full bloom of Crimson Rapture...",
