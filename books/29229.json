  "description": "Astrology offers writers a powerful tool - a means by which to get to know the characters in any story - how they feel, think, and what motivates them. As the individual energies associated with the star signs are explored, each character comes alive and their destiny is revealed.In this book, Giselle Green examines the zodiac in terms of the four elements, earth, fire, air and water. She describes the twelve sun signs and relates them to the elements. Examples of characters from well-known books have been used throughout, and writers are shown how even characters with the same motivation may desire a different outcome. This is a book which makes the patterns of the zodiac accessible to the writer and to anyone with an interest in astrology.",
