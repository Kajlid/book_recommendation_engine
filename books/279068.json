  "title": "The Idea & Story Without Words",
  "description": "These two novels-without-words feature evocative woodcuts that encourage the reader's own imagination to create the story line. Created in the 1920s by the acclaimed wood-engraver Frans Masereel, this unique book contains two picture-novels in one. Flip The Idea upside down, and you can look through Story Without Words. The images in The Idea depict the progress of an idea, in the mysterious form of a woman spirit, as it moves through the world. Story Without Words is a haunting love story rich with symbolism.",
