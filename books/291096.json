  "description": "Welcome back! I’ve missed you. I’d ask how you’ve been, but we’re not going to pretend like I don’t already know.So, where were we? Ah yes, I remember...The idea that love looks or feels perfect is not only a myth, it’s a dangerous delusion.Everyone has control over their own actions. What they cannot control are the responses to those actions. We’re all aware of the usual suspects’ ability to have a good time. That has never changed. They’re famous for it. The whole crew is back again, and the family is growing.But each of their pasts play a major role in who they are today…So, what happens when your past shows up to threaten your future, and the people that you love question not only themselves, but you too?Can you believe that after all that I’ve done for them, they still question so many things? I’m insulted.Hello! Standing right over here waiting to be asked. You know, just watching the world spin, twiddling My all-powerful thumbs and whatnot.Let not your heart be troubled, as you believe in God, believe also in Me…(Note: This is a revised version of Believe In God, Believe Also in me -God’s Hand Book 3- with additional scenes and chapters, hope you enjoy!)",
