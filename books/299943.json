  "title": "Making A Wish",
  "description": "No matter how old you are, making a wish is second nature to us all. Whether we notice we are doing it or not, we all dream, want, and hope for something. The strength that comes behind the imagination of the wish, is amazing. Every child, big of small; young and old, should feel empowered to wish for their own unique and special dream or hope. Fiona Trinket en-cultures this in her children's books. Never forget to wish, pray, dream, or hope because in those moments anything is always possible.",
