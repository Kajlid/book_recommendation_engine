  "description": "Her people call him a demon, but he’s the only one who can save her. When gifted computer engineer, Lilith Galeron, is arrested for a crime she didn’t commit by the brutal regime that controls Dome City, she has no idea what will become of her. People arrested by the Peace Keepers have a habit of disappearing. Her captors throw her into a cell with a demon; a creature she never really believed existed. Terrified by his fearsome aspect, she expects him to kill her, but Ranove is not the monster she believes him to be. Despite their differences, an attraction sparks between them, and Lilith learns that the world beyond her “bubble city” is far larger and more fascinating than she could’ve imagined. Will they live long enough for the passion that ignites between them to grow into something deeper? Please note: 18+ Contains explicit content that may not be suitable for younger readers.",
