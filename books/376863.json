  "title": "Paradise",
  "description": "Isa is a young woman addicted to her preternatural lover Jaleen. Tucked far away from prying eyes, she's free to give into the drugged bliss of being only with him. However, in this perfect existence another life haunts her, one with the power to take her away. Desperate to keep her secret from Jaleen she denies the truth---only to find Hell a kiss away. This dark, unconventional 7,500 word short story is meant for adult readers who prefer morally ambiguous tales. \"Paradise\" is also included in the anthology \"Fracture.\"_____If you like my work, you'll enjoy Kitty Thomas, Remittance Girl, and Annabel Joseph. Their fiction is dark, unconventional, and definitely worth a look!",
