  "description": "A wise Verdan once said, “Indeed we are takers, but we are a different type of takers. As we dwell on the fringes of lives that are not our own, lives we add nothing to, we tend to be the ones who appreciate them the most. What we collect are memories that are not ours, and then, alone, in the dark recesses of our cold lairs, we gaze upon our prize. Night after night, for years we care not count, we watch those legacies, as if by claiming them, we can be part of their story, and they can become part of ours. We are truly untouchable, unmovable, unreachable, but we are alone. The true purpose of our existence, my dear protégés, remains Veiled.”What Nimtha and the rest of the Verdan have seen can fill thousands of books, but he does not realize that the greatest chapter of his life is yet to be written. At the turn of tide, when all the secrets the world of Talor had kept to itself for thousands of years are revealed to him, Nimtha finds himself entangled in the events that can save the world… or destroy it. He then faces what he dreads the most, he must choose.",
