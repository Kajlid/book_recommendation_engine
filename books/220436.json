  "description": "To Toran, fate means everything. Unfortunately, his fate has him squarely by the balls. Cursed by a long-poisoned life force that teems within him, the daemon prince is powerless to do the one thing he’s bound by fate to do: safely impregnate his intended Vimora bride, which will deliver his crown while triggering a prophecy that promises his people’s salvation. His only hope is finding his faine, a rare vampire who feasts on energy––and the only creature strong enough to tame his own.As the last living faine, Liv owes the daemons and Toran nothing. After escaping certain death at the daemons’ hands, her entire existence has been a battle to harvest just enough energy to carry on. When she’s at last discovered, she’s powerless to stop Toran from enslaving her to achieve his endgame. But long starved of energy thus benumbed to tactile sensation, Liv soon finds her senses, and her desire, roaring to life at Toran’s touch. And rocked by their intense connection, Toran is ensnared in a vicious struggle between love and duty, prophecy and the promise of happiness.With the fate of a world on the line, will Toran give up his destiny to have her?",
