  "description": "Si and Danny are best friends, teenage sons of single mothers in North London. Si just wants to listen to music and smoke a little dope with the hippy crowd on Primrose Hill. Danny wants Si to help him kill his junky mother's violent boyfriend. Murder isn't Si's scene - until the beautiful Eleanor arrives, obsessed with sex and eager for the kill. 'I simply couldn't put the book down. Falconer shows as superb a command of structure and pacing as she does of character. Intense, intelligent and highly readable, Primrose Hill is a book of which any experienced novelist could be proud. As Falconer's debut it's stunning. My hat is off.' Guardian",
