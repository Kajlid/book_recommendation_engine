Alone in a glen.This is the story of the three queens—after they were born, before they were separated, during the time when they all lived together, loved each other, and protected each other. It’s also the story of the day they were torn apart, and the several years that follow.From birth to eleven years old, this is a rare glimpse of the queens' lives…before they were at stake.",
