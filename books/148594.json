  "description": "Isobel has spent her life running from the mistakes of her past, but she is ready to settle down. Unfortunately second chances aren't easy to come by, especially when you've hurt the person you love the most and Isobel did that four years ago, when she walked out on her husband Tory.Thanks to the machinations of their pastor though, Isobel finds herself back under the same roof as Tory. The familiarity has her yearning for what used to be, but she knows there’s no way he's going to accept the truth of her return, much less love her again.And she's when Tory is confronted with all the pain and emotions he thought he'd left behind, he adamantly refuses to forgive her. But as they spend time together, the love he once felt for her begins to surface.Now, as the two struggle with forgiving and being forgiven, they find that reconciliation is possible – but only if they look beyond what was and deal with the trouble that's followed Isobel back into Tory’s arms.",
