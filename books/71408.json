Texting back and forth with a raunchy, unknown man leads to a case of mistaken identity and one hell of a huge surprise.Who knew a trip to Seattle would land Tristan Miles in the arms of his mate?

The two men can’t stand each other. Tristan is used to being the alpha male and that’s bad news when his mate is wired the same way. Clawing and fighting to be top wolf causes more friction between the two men who sure do kiss a lot for people who can’t stand each other.Can Tristan back down? Can Scott? Are both men guilty of too much pride? Maybe both should plead the Fifth.WARNING: This book contains material that maybe offensive to some: Violence, graphic language, homosexual relations, adult situations.",
