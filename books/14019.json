Ethan Jacobs is a computer programmer and amateur ghost hunter who tries everything he can think of to communicate with the dead, keeping his notes in an electronic journal. After a friend talks about a ghostly encounter from her youth at a friendly get together, things start to happen in Ethan’s apartment. It starts with noises and dreams, and escalates into a life and death struggle that challenges Ethan’s faith and his will to live.\"-Thom Futrell, http://thetombofthereaper.blogspot.com",
