  "description": "Trevor Diamond, singer and violinist for KWESTT, didn’t plan on spending his vacation teaching at a youth camp, but his recent brush with the law earned him the adult version of a time-out. Now he’s stuck playing babysitter to a bunch of squirmy anklebiters at the campground with the funny name. The only thing that might make his summer bearable is his new coworker—the pretty one with the wildly colored hair.  Tayleigh Jones’s dysfunctional childhood instilled in her a deeper cautious streak than her brightly striped blond locks would suggest. But with college out of the way and her mother and brother doing well, she can relax a while. Life is finally on an even keel, and her summer is looking bright and easy. Especially after Trevor Diamond walks in and introduces himself as the newest addition to the youth camp staff.  Without warning, Tayleigh’s past reinvades her life, ripping open old wounds and stirring up trouble she’d thought safely locked away. When she discovers Trevor is at Wad-A-Wa as a result of the same types of choices that nearly destroyed her family and landed her father in prison, her feelings of betrayal threaten their budding relationship. Can Trevor convince Tayleigh he’s changed and to risk taking a chance on him, or will the summer end up being one they both wish to forget?",
