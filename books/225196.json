  "description": "Matt Bartlett’s Christmas could use a little sparkle this year. Lucky for him, his extravagant gay best friend Aedan Gallagher arrives on his doorstep on Christmas morning, bringing with him a much-needed blast of festive cheer. Unknown to Matt, Aedan has been holding a torch for his best friend for years. Matt and his family have been pulled apart in the last year by his dad’s affair and the subsequent divorce. Now Matt and his younger sister are expected to play nice and share the holidays with his dad’s new family. Aedan vows to stay by Matt’s side, though, no matter what. As they navigate Matt’s vindictive step-mother and Aedan’s own family trouble, Matt starts to realise that Aedan might be more than just a friend to him. He just doesn’t know whether he should – or even can – take the next step for the first time, because then he’d have to accept something about himself he’s afraid to admit...Glitter on the Garland is a steamy, standalone MM romance novel featuring lots of prosecco, even more glitter, a reunion with a beloved dog, kisses in the snow and the best Christmas present of all. With a guaranteed HEA and absolutely no cliffhanger.",
