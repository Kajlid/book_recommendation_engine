  "description": "Freelance tech journalist Lily Foss wears many masks. No one knows the \"L. Foss\" who reviews the latest Eidolon robotic companions is also \"codemonkkey,\" whose program cost the Eidolon manufacturer a lot of money. No one knows she can't sleep at night. No one even knows she's a woman, and all of this secrecy makes fulfilling her desires as a sexual submissive next to impossible. Not even the newest Eidolon can replace a living, breathing Dominant.Lily pins her hopes on the rumor that her best friend and fellow programmer Finley used to tie up his old girlfriend, but after a night with him falls apart, all she wants is a Dom who won't ask for her heartâ€”or her real identity. Then a chance meeting gets her the business card of a high-class escort named the Stranger who specializes in domination. His commanding presence and guaranteed discretion seem like the perfect solution.But Lily isn't the only one who wears a mask or the only one trapped between fantasy and reality, past and present, pleasure and pain. When the masks come off, Lily will have no choice but to face the horrifying truth.",
