So when the new hottie at school, Steven, starts taking notice of her she's positive that she's found her very own vampire boyfriend. Unfortunately, in The World of Jeanette, sexy Irish boys with albinism can sometimes be mistaken for the undead; and after she gets dumped for taking her Twilight obsession too far, she sets out on a life changing quest to win Steven back. And when Jeanette wants something, not even paper towel mini skirts, conniving aunts, and the entire expanse of the U.S. can stop her from getting it... but her budding love for the charming and mysterious Grayson just might.",
