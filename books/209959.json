The truth behind the Hawthornes' rise from small town candy makers to international chocolate magnates is as disturbing as it is unbelievable, and the only man who knows the whole story has a reason not to tell it. As Marnie becomes entangled in the mysterious drama of her grandmother's life, she finds that her future depends on the ghosts haunting someone else's past. Spanning four generations, Blood and Chocolate tells an epic story of longing, forbidden love and the unpredictable consequences of desire.",
