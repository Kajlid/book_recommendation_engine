  "description": "I am mentally exhausted. I am at my wit's end. I am in the dark, again, with no end in sight. But just when all hope seems lost, a light appears at the end of the tunnel. A confession... that breaks me from the stranglehold of hopelessness and despair. An admission... that brings new dimensions to the man who is shrouded in secrecy. Stonehart’s revelation can never change what he’s done to me. But can it be enough to make a difference in how I see him? As old questions are answered, new ones arise: Is it possible for a man to change? Is is possible for him to repent for all his sins? And, perhaps most important of all: Is it possible for me to forgive?",
