  "description": "A Journey Forgotten , by author Emily Noll, follows writer Connor Anderson who is plagued by a bad case of writer's block. When Connor takes a serious fall during an innocent encounter with a leggy prospect, he finds himself shifting between his hospital bed and a spaceship where everyone calls him Captain. Trying to reconcile the two worlds, his sense of self, and which life is really his, Connor is forced to step into his Captain role as he and his crew discovers an apocalyptic danger that threatens the existence of literally everything. Which world is his world and which life will win out is anyone's guess, least of all Conner's, but one thing is clear, writer's block is the least of his problems. Told with wit and humor and written in masterful prose, A Journey Forgotten will keep you guessing while it entertains every step of the way. Noll has written a book in the best tradition of space-opera sci-fi. This is a book that will not only interest science fiction fans, but also anyone who loves a great adventure well-told.",
