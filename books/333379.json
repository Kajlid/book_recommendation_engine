I started a curse dispelling business and put on an alter ego.Just me?As the Enchanter, I use my family’s hunter magic to dispel curses in the port city of Haven. I just want to keep my head down and survive.Until guardians from the Aegis organization find me. ​They’ve come to request the Enchanter’s help with an important case. Helping them gives me an opportunity to make up for the sins of my past. But it means working with the very people that hunt my kind.  The Enchanter’s Blood is a slow burn reverse harem.
