  "title": "Between the Pages: Where trials become TRIUMPH!",
  "description": "Throughout many civilizations, women have endured much in silence. They dare not utter a word about their hardship, discomfort, or even abuse. After all, many would argue that women have no voice as they are inferior beings. Therefore, with lips pressed tight, many women scream within and breathe when told. They stifle tears in the darkness - prisoners by memories they dare not share, until now. Between the Pages accounts the life of one brave woman, HIV/AIDS advocate and artist, Joyce Ann McDonald. Join the many people across the globe who have already found inspiration and strength from the transparency of her life story which transcends from a life of low self-esteem, drug and sexual abuse, to ordained minister, NYS chaplain, and world renowned speaker and testimonial artist.",
