  "description": "Find out why real werewolves wear kilts!\n  Milly's boss, the visionary tech billionaire Iain Scotswolf, is brilliant, fascinating, and sexy as all get out. Unfortunately, he's also arrogant, excessively demanding, and far too sinfully handsome for his meek assistant to actually look in the eye.  But as Milly has been reminding herself every single day for the past three years, she really needs this job. So she has no choice but to put up with the boss from hell and his exacting standards.  But then she's given a terminal diagnosis. With only a few months left to live, Milly decides to make the most of the time she has left and puts in her two week's notice.  Totally valid reason to quit, right?  Apparently not for her sexy boss. The only thing more shocking than Iain's response to her resignation? The secret he's been hiding all along...  WARNING: Theodora Taylor fans--do not one-click this book if you're not ready for a REAL Scottish alpha wolf who will have you cursing him one moment, and saying, \"Oh, Iain!\" the next. This hot romance has so much heart, it just might inspire you to hop on the next flight to Scotland and start searching for your very own \"wolf in a kilt.\" Don't say we didn't warn you!",
