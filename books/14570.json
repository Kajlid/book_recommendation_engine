  "description": "It is August of 1963, the year of the Taylor-Burton epic film Cleopatra, showcasing a passion too grand to be contained on the movie screen. The women of the Kalyna Beach cottage community gather for gossip, trading the current racy bestsellers among them as an escape from the rhythms of children and chores. Dramatic change is coming this summer as desire reaches a boiling point, threatening to disrupt the warm, sweet, heady days and lives of parents and children, family and friends.",
