  "description": "Roald Dahl, that master of wicked humor, has created a ghastly menagerie of dirty beastsâ€”all doing the most extraordinary and unmentionable things, in irrelevant and absurdly comic verse!\"No animal is half so vile, as Crocky-Wock the crocodile.On Saturdays he likes to crunchSix juicy children for his lunch, and he especially enjoysJust three of each, three girls, three boys.\"Dahl once again lets his inimitable style and humor shine in this collection of poems about mischievous and mysterious animals. From Stingaling the Scorpion to Crocky-Wock the Crocodile, Dahl's animals are nothing short of ridiculous! A clever pig with an unmentionable plan to save his own bacon and an anteater with an unusually large appetite are among the characters created by Dahl in these timeless rhymes. Roald Dahl, the brilliant and worldwide acclaimed author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, and many more classics for children, also wrote scores of short stories. These delightful tales have often been turned into hit films or television episodes, and even today, Roald Dahl's stories continue to make millions of readers rejoice with his brilliant prose.\nStory List:\n- The Pig- The Crocodile- The Lion- The Scorpion- The Ant-Eater- The Porcupine- The Cow- The Toad and the Snail",
