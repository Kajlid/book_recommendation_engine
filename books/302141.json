He just might get his wish when he stumbles upon an accident and meets the woman who can make him change his outlook and possibly get him to settle down.Find out what happens when a feisty woman meets her match in the anti-prince charming! Will it lead to a happily ever after?Until Serena is part of Aurora Rose Reynolds's Happily Ever Alpha World. If you loved Until December, then you will want to read Until Serena.",
