  "title": "Chas Addams Half-Baked Cookbook: Culinary Cartoons for the Humorously Famished",
  "description": "Food and eating were a couple of Charles Addams's favorite subjects. Hungry cannibals, witches gathering around a cauldron, or a king over his blackbird pie often populated his celebrated cartoons. And, of course, Morticia of the \"Addams Family\" was an avid cook, adding a touch of eye of newt or popping over to the neighbors for a cup of cyanide. So it should come as no wonder that in the 1960s Charles Addams was dabbling with a \"cookbook\" idea. Addams discovered and compiled some bizarre recipes from antiquated and out-of-the-way sources. These recipes have very Addams-like names, such as \"Mushrooms Fester\" or \"Hearts Stuffed,\" and serve as a perfect complement to his drawings. Chas Addams? Half-Baked Cookbook is a collection of his work on the world of food and eating, featuring many Addams drawings that have never been seen before, as well as some of his all-time classics.",
