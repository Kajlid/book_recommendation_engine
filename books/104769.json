  "description": "This third installment of true ghost stories recounts not only experiences from Willow Cross, but also stories from close personal friends. Ghostly knocks on doors, an apparition who seems to enjoy peeping into windows in the dead of night, and even a specter who insists on taking up residence in a childâ€™s closet. As with the other two volumes, all the stories are believed to be 100% true.",
