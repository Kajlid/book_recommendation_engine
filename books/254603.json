  "description": "In the last book of the Kennebec River Trilogy the small city of Hallowell fights to save their community from an outside evil. The story of a small Maine river city in the early 1960s concludes with another murder, more sex, more mayhem, more troubled personal relationships, and a master plan that no one would anticipate. L. E. Barrett has expertly crafted an entertaining story that weaves seductive local characters, a place in time, and a unique storyline that is certain to keep you riveted to each page. The Valley of Good and Evil is a historical pulp fiction classic. A throwback to the trashy novels of the 1940s to 1960s where women craved love, men were tough, and violence was a business opportunity. A story that could have been written by the likes of Steinbeck or Doctorow. The book is insightful, funny, thrilling, and sexy without pretense. The author brings to life captivating characters, an original story, and breath-taking twists and turns. Like the first two books in The Kennebec River Trilogy (The Boys from Joppa and Dummers Lane), The Valley of Good and Evil is a quirky slice of adult fiction that provides an enjoyable read that is funny, scandalous and thought-provoking. From the first chapter to the last - Dip, Phil, Martha, Bunny, Rita, Connie, Big Robbie, Chief Buck, Emma and the other characters will fill your imagination with a unique place, nonconforming people, and a way of life that has passed but still exists within the pages of the Kennebec River Trilogy.",
