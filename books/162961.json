Everywhere Nika looks, she sees amazing spectacles of magic, wonder, mystery, and danger, and she finds herself feeling unfamiliar emotions.From fledgling curiosity and rebellion, to budding romantic attraction, Nika slowly but surely begins to discover herself and come to terms with who, and what, she is. But when a fire and murder interrupt her life, the comfort, companionship, and control she’s only begun to experience are threatened. If she is to stay true to herself and live to see another day, Nika must embrace the danger that surrounds her and dredge through the past that confounds her—though doing so could prove fatal.As you follow Nika through Justice Trail , expect the unexpected. Hers is a story you don’t want to miss.",
