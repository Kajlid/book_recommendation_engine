  "description": "A painful longing…  Jordan knows his crush on Rick is hopeless. His football teammate and lifelong friend is straight. Now that they’re heading off to college in separate states, maybe Jordan can finally find a man who’ll return his feelings. He doesn’t know Rick’s secret: every time he’s with a girl, all he can think about is Jordan.  A shattering encounter…  Two weeks before they start their freshman year, the pair spend the weekend in a mountain cabin with a king-sized bed. Years of simmering desire hit the flash point, and Jordan can’t help falling in love with his best friend.  But Rick struggles to accept the truth. He’s afraid of his parents’ disappointment, and as time passes, he only retreats deeper into the closet.  A wrenching choice…  Jordan can’t stop loving Rick, but he won’t live a lie. His ultimatum—come out, or we’re through—traps Rick between his all-American golden-boy image and the man who could be his everything. Will he risk it all to win Jordan’s love?  This steamy gay romance trilogy is for a mature audience. It has an HEA and no cliffhanger.",
