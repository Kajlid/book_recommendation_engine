  "description": "Jess loved Nick with every fiber of her being. But would love be enough to compete with the dark, sinister business he ran? Nick never lied to her about the life he led. In fact he never lied to her about anything. Now she realizes every bit of his words were true. He was the sexiest, scariest, most dangerous man she had ever met. And now, it seems…the danger was hers as well. Passion, lust and emotion explode in part 3 of Fallen Angel, with a cliffhanger that leaves you shocked, stunned…and wanting more. *** Fallen Angel is a mafia romance serial novel released every 4 to 6 weeks, at approximately 8000 to 11000 words each. Due to sexual content, implied and actual scenes of abuse, violence, organized crime, language and frequent illegal drug use, we recommend this to mature audiences, ages 18 and over, who are comfortable with this subject matter. ***",
