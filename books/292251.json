  "description": "The Beckoning Road, by Caroline Dale Snedeker is an exciting and romantic sequel to the Newbery Honor Book, Downright Dencey. The history of the United States, from the colonial era to the present day has been scattered with various attempts to create a utopian society that would avoid historical injustices in the affairs of its inhabitants. This is the continuing story of the coming of age of a young Quaker girl (Dencey Coffyn) against an historically accurate background of one such Utopian experiment—the 1825 founding of New Harmony, Indiana. Dencey’s travels from Nantucket Island, through Philadelphia and New York, across the great forest of Ohio to Indiana were filled with hope, fear, excitement, conflict, love, illness and desperation. Her memories were filled with Jetsam—the first boy who kissed her—and who was away on a four-year whaling voyage. He wanted her to wait for his return, yet she had to go West with her family and would not be there when he came back. Dencey’s father Tom was fulfilling his dream of becoming a zoologist by joining in the founding of New Harmony. Dencey would learn of her talent for art and as she learned it, it would fill her with joy. But the conflicts of cultures between her Quaker upbringing and the new utopian community would both invigorate and try her soul. And the new young men she met in New Harmony, young, exciting, literate, courageous, filled with imagination—would they drive a wedge between Dencey and Jetsam?",
