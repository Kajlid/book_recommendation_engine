  "description": "Ten seconds can change everything.  I fell in love with him twelve years ago when I was little more than a child. In the blink of an eye, he went from my best friend’s big brother to Tucker – the boy who made my heart beat faster with just a look. But he never saw me as anything more than family and I was forced to let him go.  Years later, all it took was one kiss, ten seconds of his lips pressed against mine, to knock my world off its axis and resurrect every old feeling I had buried so long ago. Now, there’s only one thing that I want and his name is Tucker Harrington.   Something is holding him back. There’s a darkness inside him that sometimes clouds his eyes and erases every piece of the fun, mischievous boy I fell in love with. His secrets haunt him and if he’s not willing to fight, how will we ever survive?",
