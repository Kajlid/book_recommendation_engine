  "description": "I write songs about fairy tales, but I never thought four gorgeous princes would sweep me off my feet.   Homeless and rejected by the school of my dreams, I somehow find myself at LUV Academy, crashing in a dorm room with an a cappella group of gorgeous, rich, talented men. They each bring their own brand of sexy and I want them all:   The relentless flirt   The sophisticated mountain-man   The sweet boy next door   And the bad-boy bully who hates me with a passion    But with the college a cappella auditions fast approaching, can I write a song that’s good enough to secure these talented guys a place in the competition? And will I be able to secure a place in their hearts and get my own happily ever after?  Author’s note: This is a slow/medium burn reverse harem story intended for audiences 18 years and older. #whychoose",
