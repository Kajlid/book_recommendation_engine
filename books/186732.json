  "description": "Jinsuke, a young village whaler, and Sadayori, an aristocratic samurai, together experience the victories and defeats of the crucial years of the Meiji restoration, the death of the shogunate, the intrusion of six American ships, and the ravages of natural disasters.Nicol uses two young men from different social classes to depict Japan in the years immediately following the opening of that country to the West in the 1850s. Jinsuke is the eldest son of the whaling village's head harpooner. On the day Jinsuke makes his first big kill, he meets Sadayori, a hereditary warrior assigned to study coastal defenses. When Jinsuke loses an arm to a shark, Sadayori arranges for him to be trained to fight one-armed and for him to work on foreign vessels. Jinsuke adopts Western ways, becoming the master of his own ship. Sadayori is caught up in various clan conflicts, often relying on his skill with swords. Nicol sketches an interesting, believable picture of whaling and that period in Japanese history, and he describes violence graphically.",
