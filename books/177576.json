It also contains specific references to Heaven and Hell, and not necessarily what is considered true or accepted.  Jake the Flame lived his life in sin. He pushed everyone who cared about him away with his selfishness and greed. A professional fire fighter, he happened to be there when a bomb devastated a church, and he gave his life helping others escape. That is when he met Ash, the new leader of Hell. Ash offers Jake a job he can't refuse as a member of the Elite Guard, a group of warrior angels charged with protecting Ash and the balance between Heaven and Hell. This could be Jake's only chance at redemption, and he takes it.  While learning to do his job and keeping an eye on the next potential Guard, Jake learns where his place in Hell really is.  Shelly is the leader of Greed and Jake is on her list. She wants him, and not just in her realm of Hell. She is driven by jealousy to mark him and make sure no one doubts who he belongs to.  A group of human Satan worshipers is not happy with the new rule in Hell, and is determined to see the gateway between Hell and Earth opened. They will stop at nothing to get what they want, even if it means kidnapping a demon, the leader of Greed, and using her blood for their evil endeavors. Will Jake learn to embrace his new power and the growing feelings he has for Shelly? Will he be able to find her before itâ€™s too late?",
