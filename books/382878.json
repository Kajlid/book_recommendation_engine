  "description": "Pink Smog , the long-awaited prequel to Francesca Lia Block's groundbreaking novel Weetzie Bat , was praised as \"an intoxicating mix of mystery, fantasy, and romance\" by ALA Booklist in a starred review. Weetzie Bat is one of the seminal young adult novels of the '90s and continues to be an iconic treasure for teens everywhere. Now Pink Smog reintroduces a whole new generation to the eponymous Weetzie Batâ€”before she was Weetzie. Against the backdrop of a Los Angeles teeming with magical realism, Louise Bat struggles to find a way to deal with life after her father's unceremonious departure. Longtime fans and newfound readers alike will fall in love with Francesca Lia Block's beautifully crafted and brutally honest world. Maggie Stiefvater, New York Times bestselling author of The Raven Boys , proclaimed \" Pink Smog sparkles and obscures; it's a glorious mirage, like the city it pays homage to.\"",
