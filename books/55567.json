  "description": "December, 2012. From a quaint little bookshop in Camden, it should have been just another routine job, a day like any other; simply visit the dying boy in Great Ormond Street Hospital and leave with his soul. Only it wasn't to be.Leaving the boy alive, Thanatos - Death, The Grim Reaper - decides to go on strike.But boredom soon sets in and, when a series of murders occur, the fingers begin to point in all directions. What should he do? And just why had everything gone awry since he'd visited this particular boy?Turning detective, and with help from his two long-term colleagues, the multi-costumed and enigmatic Ferryman, Harry, and the ever-dependable Saint Peter, the hunt for a killer is on.Mixed with supernatural goings-on, Death & Taxes is a modern tale of woe and deception, love and friendship, mirth and miracles - and butterflies.",
