  "description": "As soon as she was old enough, Sadie Callahan left her hometown of Red Valley in the dust and never looked back. Now she’s a world-renowned photographer living in San Francisco with the perfect apartment, a successful boyfriend and a job she’s always dreamed of. When Sadie receives a mysterious phone call about her mother, her seemingly perfect life comes to a screeching halt. She is forced to return to the town she never fit into and is confronted with tragic news that changes everything. If that wasn’t bad enough, she runs into her high school sweetheart, Jared Ferrara. Jared is the ultimate bad boy with sleeves of tattoos, a leather jacket and, of course, a motorcycle. While trying to keep her past at bay, Sadie finds out that most tattoos aren’t skin deep.",
