  "description": "Willow Kensington hasn’t had much say in her life lately. None of her relationships have recovered from the fallout six months ago, and she still finds herself missing Ethan.  After six months without contact, she doubts he’d even want to hear from her. Deciding to find out once and for all, she finally reaches out to the one man she can’t get off her mind.   Private investigator Ethan Wilde’s days of going undercover are long over, but they’ve left his life in shambles. Kicked out of his home by a wife who can no longer look at him, whiskey is his only companion as he mourns the loss of both his former lives—and lives neither.  Until suddenly Willow reaches out to him, and Ethan must decide whether to open the door to the fire that torched his life in the first place, or keep it firmly shut.  **Warning: adult content**",
