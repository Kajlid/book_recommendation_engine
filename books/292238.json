  "title": "Def Leppard Animal Instinct: The Def Leppard Story",
  "description": "Def Leppard are the classic story of rock & roll schoolboys grown into rock superstars. Since their formation in 1977 they had the talent, determination and stamina to climb to the heights of international stardom, capped by their mega-million sales album PYROMANIA...But nothing could have prepared them for personal tragedies and professional disasters that inflicted their lives and plunged them back to relative obscurity in the mid 1980s.More than anything, though, Def Leppard had good instincts. And in rock & roll instinct spells survival.ANIMAL INSTINCT is the story of that survival, from the early days in Sheffield, England to their triumphant return to the international rock arena and HYSTERIA in the charts.",
