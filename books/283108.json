  "description": "It's hard to admire the man at the top when he broke off a serious relationship to get there.  When Sierra Ray discovers that Josh Logan works for the gigantic company that wants to buy out her shop, she adamantly refuses to sell. Why would she ever sell out to a man who left her one week into their engagement? Although their relationship occurred over five years ago, how could she ever give in to a man who only treated her as an obstacle on his lone road to success?  Lonely at the Top is a testament that nothing, even ultimate success, is more meaningful or lasting than true love.  A true romance must come from the heart, a trait that author Ruth Davidson has no shortage of. Her style of writing is largely inspired by Jane Austen, considering her to be the first true romance author, and also Hallmark, believing that beauty is in its simplicity. Ruth's catchphrase for her books is \"clean romance that leaves a smile in your heart,\" and she fully commits to that ideal whenever she puts pen to paper.
