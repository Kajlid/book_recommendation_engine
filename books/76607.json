  "description": "Elinna Serru dreams of becoming a Preceptor of the House of Lohenrin. The adepts of that ancient house are trained in the healing arts by the S'hazons, light beings who came to Atlaua from another dimension and aided the Preceptors in vanquishing war and disease. Elinna longs to realize the full potential of her natural khi power and develop her healing gift for the good of her people. But turmoil bubbles beneath the tranquil surface of Atlaua. For centuries the S'hazons have controlled the land through the Power. But now the ancient religion of the Sky Gods has returned, and its priests have accused the S'hazons of hiding a secret, evil purpose. That new faith seduces Elinna's best friend, Hasmonea, and the man she loves, the Inheritor, Mesor. Determined to prove that the S'hazons are their true saviors, Elinna undertakes a quest for the truth. But when she discovers a shattering revelation, she is forced toward an unthinkable choice, a choice that might cost her everything she loves.",
