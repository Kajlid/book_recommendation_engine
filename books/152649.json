  "description": "Lovers of legal thrillers will rejoice in this gripping, timely page-turner about religious fanaticism, freedom of speech, courtroom intrigue, and high-stakes mystery. Ezekiel Shaw and his fanatical followers preach a gospel of hate, picketing the funerals of fallen soldiers, and praising God for sending America’s soldiers back in body bags. But when they disrupt the funeral of Second Lieutenant Lauren Hanson, a West Point graduate killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, hard-charging Fort Worth trial attorney Jace Forman becomes determined to put an end to their crazed crusade no matter the cost. As Jace and reporter Leah Rosen battle the odds and the clock in pursuit of justice and truth in the courts, they draw closer to uncovering a shocking conspiracy—and facing sinister forces that will stop at nothing to keep them from revealing the truth. “Religious extremism is a very dangerous and powerful force,” said Crouch. “It threatens our First Amendment rights and has been used to suppress women’s rights throughout the world (including our own country).” Blending fast-paced action with authentic courtroom drama, The Word will keep readers enthralled from its explosive prologue to nail-biting conclusion.
