  "title": "The Rainbow Singer",
  "description": "\"The narrator of this novel is Wil Carson, a \"no-hoper from the back-streets of East Belfast,\" and an unusual prisoner to be banged up in a Wisconsin penitentiary. From behind bars, Wil tells us of his life as a teenaged Irish Loyalist-terrorist, rejecting the prejudices he held against Catholics, or \"Taigs,\" and sardonically reflecting on the mixed bag of blessings and curses that have made his life to date.\" Wil's routine of watching American television and movies, listening to heavy metal, and secretly terrorising the Taigs is disrupted in the summer of 1985 when his parents force him into the peace initiatve \"Project Ulster.\" Along with nine other Protestant and ten Catholic teenagers, Will is charitably whisked away from his broken home to spend a month making friends of his enemies in Milwaukie, USA. Only problem is ... for Wil, peacemaking comes hard. And it gets harder still when he is persecuted by two Taigs, Seamus and Peter. Wil swears vengeance, but puts it on \"ice cream\" (a dish best served cold) while he runs after Teresa, a Catholic girl. It is only with the encouragement of Derry the Hulk - Wil's American host - that \"tit-for-tat\" pranks flare into sectarian feuding. Through all the hatred, the Project Counselors try, but their mediations can't seem to stop the home of Happy Days from turning into a nightmare like Ulster, only worse.",
