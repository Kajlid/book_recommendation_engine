  "description": "Sophia Armitage returns to Year 12, nursing injuries inflicted by another student. Her old friendship group have turned their backs on her, leaving her isolated and alone in the worst school in the city. Apart from Dane McArdle, that is. Her handsome new boyfriend is the only good thing in her life at the moment, because her home life is pants as well. Sophia’s mother is living around the corner with her new man after disappearing without trace for almost three months and her father is still reeling. As she strives for some kind of normality in her life, Sophia is beset by disaster. Her mother never listened to her father and it seems that Sophia is cursed with the same stubborn nature. If only she had done as Dane asked her. If only she hadn’t thought she knew better. Her actions open up a world of trouble for Dane and Sophia is forced to take even more risks to put it all right. Friendless and alone, she finds help in unexpected places and learns that forgiveness can be harder to accept, than to give.",
