  "description": "A scar is bornSomewhere between the realms of self-help and religion lies the Honest World Foundation. Its creator started out as an obscure writer of disposable horror fiction who decided to change the world—one mind at a time. Now its adherents rule Hollywood while obeying their leader's every command.That's almost all anyone knows about the movement—or is it a cult?—founded by reclusive guru Astrid Mueller. But reporter Chloe Pierce is sure that there's something deeper hiding behind Honest World's facade. Her fiancé was a devoted follower of Mueller, right up to the moment when he blew his brains out while holding a copy of her book. Now Chloe wants answers from the woman whose words command the loyalty of millions—and she's ready to storm the top-secret sanctuary known as the Clean Room to get them.But there's more to Astrid Mueller than Chloe could ever imagine—and the truth that she's about to discover is more astonighing than any of Astrid's accomplishments, and more terrifying than any of her novels.From the mind of superstar writer Gail Simone and gifted artisti Jon Davis-Hunt comes CLEAN ROOM, VOL. 1: IMMACULATE CONCEPTION—a new vision of horror that takes you inside the locked chambers of sex, violence, celebrity, and the supernatural.Collectis issues #1-6",
