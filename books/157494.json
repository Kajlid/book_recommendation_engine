  "description": "There once were two couples, neighbors in fact, but like most neighbors today, hardly a word was spoken in passing. What they knew of each other mostly consisted of what was inadvertently heard through the wall that divided their townhomes. The Langstons and the Russos had more in common than they both knew. Both couples were newly married and terribly unhappy, each for different reasons of course. Scott and Jenna Langston were facing an incurable disease and Ava and Peter Russo were plagued with heartache and betrayal. Too often, Scott could hear Ava crying through the wall. He wondered what would make such a beautiful woman so sad, but he had enough of his own problems, he couldn’t worry about what was happening on the other side of the wall. On occasion, Ava could hear Scott’s pleas for his wife to be well. She wanted to offer help and comfort, but she was too physically and emotionally exhausted to reach out across the wall. Eventually, Ava’s crying ceased and her name changed. Scott’s pleas went quiet as they went unanswered. Now, instead of two couples, there were two very lonely heartbroken individuals divided by a wall, each trying to deal with the hand they had been dealt.",
