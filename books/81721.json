  "description": "Jack Sigler, call sign “King,” field leader for a black ops organization known as Endgame, is accustomed to feeling capable of handling most any situation. It is a confidence forged in the fires of battle against both monsters and madmen. But the introduction of Asya, a sister he never knew existed, and the kidnapping of his parents has him reeling. Using Endgame’s resources, King and his Chess Team (Queen, Rook, Bishop, and Knight) scour the planet for his parents, tracking a man known to the world as Alexander Diotrephes, but known to King by another name. A masked man walks past their secret headquarters’ defenses, sits himself down in the director’s chair, and waits. He’s Richard Ridley, the team’s oldest and most dangerous enemy, who is supposed to be dead. But he isn’t Ridley. He is a clone in search of his master, the real Ridley, who yet lives and is being held captive by the same man that is holding King’s parents.",
