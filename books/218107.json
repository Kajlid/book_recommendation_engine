  "description": "The real action is off the court… The only thing on Luke Rossovich's mind is winning pro tennis tournaments. That is, until the day Jesse McAllister shows up in the locker room. Luke can't get the young blond out of his head, and soon they team up on the doubles court. Before Luke knows it, he's letting Jesse into his bed — and his heart. Jesse doesn't see why they have to hide who they are from the world, but Luke has been in the closet for years. He's a household name with millions in endorsements to think about -- no way is he going to admit to being gay. But as his secret relationship with Jesse deepens, the rules of the game Luke's played so well suddenly seem to be changing... Publisher's Note: This story contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: male/male sexual practices.",
