  "description": "The reluctant truce between the Defiance MC and Keller's mafia is necessitated by shared hatred for the Lords of Vengeance—bloodthirsty thugs who pose a deadly threat to both Defiance's survival and Keller's people in the difficult post-apocalyptic world. For Rebel, this means more than just a secondary war—Declan, one of Keller's main assassins, has moved to the Defiance compound. The problem is, he and Declan have a history, one that Rebel broke off months earlier when the relationship threatened to become more than just covert sex. Rebel’s charged with keeping Declan close, and the proximity makes it impossible for him to deny his feelings. Rebel’s been hiding his sexual preferences from his MC, among other secrets he hold close. But Rebel realizes that the LoV isn’t the biggest enemy Defiance faces when Declan goes after a mysterious group called the Nomads. Most think the Nomads are little more than a myth, but Declan—and Keller—know the truth. And when one of Declan’s jobs threatens to put Defiance—and Rebel—in direct danger, Declan also reveals secrets that Rebel isn’t prepared for. One that makes him question everything he once thought about the relationship...and forces him to make a choice between his heart and his head…something no one in Defiance is ready for.",
