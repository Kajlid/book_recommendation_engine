But she also sees it may not be enough to make things right. Perhaps only a cat--a wise, observant, very determined cat--can do that . . .Wonderfully tender and insightful, The Astonishing Thing explores the intricacies of marriage and family through an unforgettable perspective at the center of it all.\"A beautiful and touching look into the intricacies of marriage and family life, all seen through the loving and unique perspective of the family pet.\"\n--Modern Cat",
