  "description": "Those who read Danielewski before, will be aware that his expansive realistic writing is simply unique in its kind. For those who have not read House of Leaves, this could be the very opportunity to get to meet easily with his border-seeking literature, that has already appealed to so many fans.One late October evening at an East Texasranch, Chintana, a seamstress recovering froma painful divorce, comes across a Story Tellercaped in shadow recounting for five orphans atale of unspoken revenge, a harrowing quest,and a terrible sword which everyone soonenough realizes waits before them concealedin a long black box.The children quickly understand the tale is butprologue to crime. Yet it is Chintana who mustchallenge the consequences of that blade'speculiar edge, which from hilt to point neverfails to sever, even if its terrors depend entirelyon time and malice.Read aloud THE FIFTY YEAR SWORD willcaptivate any child. Read alone the complexitiesof nameless voices, misplaced narratives ofhate, and the horrors of delayed violence,which only our retellings can rescue and restore,will thrill and touch the sharpest reader.Once again Mark Z. Danielewski challengeshow we authorize ourselves, mischievouslyplaying with layout, color and the wide potentialsof perspective in order to create a hugelyentertaining story about a sword none will forgetthough some may recall encountering anda few will even acknowledge wielding.",
