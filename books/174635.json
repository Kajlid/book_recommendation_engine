  "description": "Action! Characters! Exposition! Normalized has it all!When Captain Might started out writing his journal he was happy as a clam. Being a superhero was a blast – freezing bad guys with his arctic breath and uppercutting them into orbit – what’s not to love? His enemies got to have their fun too with their earthquake machines and their lava cannons and their robot tentacles. It’s a merry old game, the ping pong of good versus evil, or at least it was before Professor D’eath tossed out the rule book and started straight up murdering people.Suddenly Captain Might is catapulted into in the real world – a world of public inquiries and law suits and media witch hunts. And to make matters worse, Professor D’eath has poached sixteen-hundred pounds of weapons-grade plutonium and looks set to scratch ‘ALL THE HUMANS’ on the side of a gigantic funeral urn. No doubt about it, things are about to get a whole lot uglier before they get worse…Part One of the Normalized quartet.",
