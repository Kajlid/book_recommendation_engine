  "description": "A must read for fans of high fantasy epics, this sword and sorcery high adventure series will be your new favorite fantasy read. Once a thriving city—now a foul necropolis, ruled over by the arisen dead. The fallen city of Brigganden now poses a threat to the neighboring lands, its demonic warlord slaughtering all who venture near. Reza, a member of an elite code of knights, leads the only troop willing to stand against the hellish army—risking not only her life to the vile arisen, but the lives of her only friends. As they struggle to survive the rising tide of evil, fulfilling their mission becomes the least of their priorities. The dead know of their presence—and this evil hungers for more than just flesh and blood. Shadow of the Arisen is the first book in a high fantasy trilogy that has deep roots in dark magic, Lovecraftian horror, and the occult. It’s an epic fantasy fiction novel that will leave you wanting more from the vibrant cast of characters you’ll grow to love.",
