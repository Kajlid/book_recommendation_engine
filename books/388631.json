  "description": "Love Can Change You. . .For Eternity. . . Tom Kyd has smoldering eyes, a sculpted body, and supernatural staying power--even for a vampire. He also thinks he knows best about everything--including how to figure out who Angela Ryan was before he and his clan rescued her from a mysterious attack that stole her memory. But whoever she is, Tom wants her. . . Six months ago Angela never would have imagined her life would turn into an episode of \"Dark Shadows\"--or that she'd be saved by the kind of man she's always fantasized about. Tom may be a vampire, and a know-it-all, but when his kisses are so sinful, so intoxicating, and so damn good, Angela is tempted to say yes to whatever he wants. . .",
