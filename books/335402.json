  "description": "Virginia Woolf tested the boundaries of fiction in these short stories, developing a new language of sensation, feeling and thought, and recreating in words the 'swarm and confusion of life'. Defying categorization, the stories range from the more traditional narrative style of Solid Objects through the fragile impressionism of Kew Gardens to the abstract exploration of consciousness in The Mark on the Wall.",
