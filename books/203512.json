Tonight.”With those words, Big Mike sucked the oxygen out of the room. Minnie intended her father would meet her new man, Big Mike… eventually. Minnie wanted to give Daddy time to get used to the idea that his 'little girl' is embroiled in a serious relationship. A few decades, perhaps. Because Daddy’s not your run-of-the-mill protective father - he's a criminal. But now Minnie is heading home for the holidays with Big Mike in tow.Big Mike is no delicate violet. He’s quiet and lethal, an ex-Special Forces soldier whose day job involves ‘keeping the Free World safe’. But Big Mike doesn’t want to spoil Minnie’s Christmas and promises not to hurt anyone… His resolve will be tested by Minnie’s father, her psycho brother and three outlaw lieutenants who want his woman. *This is a 12,000 word story packed with everything needed for a very merry Christmas: love, laughter, bikers and psychos.",
