  "description": "Ethien longs to become a Heliod, but he does not possess their power to transform space into matter and has struggled all his life to attain it. When his world is threatened by a powerful force, he undertakes a perilous journey to uncover his true purpose, one that will lead him to uncover an ancient and forgotten history of his people.Accompanying him on this journey is Hannah Allende, a stranger to his world. She has led an aimless life without purpose and has joined him at a moment of crisis, one of terrible grief and doubt. At first it is Ethien’s journey, but it soon becomes her own. She uncovers a previously unknown wellspring of strength and resolve that propels them both forward, ultimately helping Ethien to unlock the secret of his inability while they both attempt to uncover the true meaning of their own powerful and enigmatic bond—a bond that will be tested in ways they could never have imagined.Spatiality is an epic science fiction/fantasy adventure that examines the effect of architectonic space on our memories, our psyche and our perceptions of the past, the present and the future. But at its heart, it is the story of two people swept into circumstances beyond their control, struggling to understand their intertwined fates.",
