Alma Benedict, the beautiful housekeeper, cool and aloof? Arthur Kagen, the burly lawyer who held the key to Jessica's inheritance—and who showed such an oddly unprofessional interest in Jessica?—And what about the unearthly music and strange silhouette that kept appearing against the night sky?With nowhere to turn, Jessica suddenly felt herself surrounded by demonic forces crying, \"Die, Jessica, die!\"",
