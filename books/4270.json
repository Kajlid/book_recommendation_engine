  "description": "Mythological creatures from around the world come alive in Volume 1 of Melanie Dellas' Fantastic, Fabulous Creatures & Beasts series. If you are a lover of mythology, fantastic beasts, magic and folklore, then this book series is for you. Dellas takes \"real\" folk tales and writes them in a fun format that will help children and adults remember them. But take heed, because she has not embellished the stories or changed them in any way from their original versions, you will find nice creatures that want to help and be friends, and not-so-nice creatures that really just want to eat you. The creatures and their stories contained within Vol. 2 are China* Russia* Greece* India* Native America* France* Switzerland* Persia and* Japan. Through her books, Dellas hopes that people will come to respect and appreciate the multicultural world we live in and remember that all of our histories are important and should not be forgotten no matter how good or bad. She also hopes that our children will remember that our world is still mystical and magical -- as long as our stories remain alive.",
