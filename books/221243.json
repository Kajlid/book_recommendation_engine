  "title": "The Werewolf Cowboy",
  "description": "The alpha wolf has vowed to protect her from all danger—including himself.  At 21, Katy Thomas is finally considered a full-fledged wolf. Yet, while she loves her adopted family and owes her allegiance to alpha Aiden Mitchell and his pack, she couldn’t be more confused. There’s only one male that attracts her. Problem is, he’s definitely not pack-approved.  Neighboring rancher Grayson Moore is a lone wolf. Bonded to no pack. Answerable to no one. A hint of danger lurks behind his ice-blue eyes. Katy could swear she hears his sexy, gravelly voice inside her head as he tracks her every move. And she can’t help but imagine him naked, and what this rugged alpha would do to her in his bed.  Grayson has lived the past year in hell, hiding dark secrets inextricably linked to a past Katy can’t remember. Fighting to control desires too wild and fierce for any normal Lupine, much less her innocent body.  But when a kidnapper sweeps Katy away into the Dark Kingdom, Grayson has no choice but to unleash his beast to save her. Only to discover that the deadliest secret was never his own, but a sinister betrayal that stabs from the shadows.  Reader’s Note: This story features a rugged, sexy cowboy with a dark, protective streak and a sassy cowgirl werewolf who knows what she wants, along with scorching hot loving. It also features characters from The Mating Destiny, Book 7 in the Werewolves of Montana series, but like all the stories in my series, The Werewolf Cowboy can be read alone.",
