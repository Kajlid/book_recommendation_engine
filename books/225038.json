  "description": "She’s scared and broken, but soon she’ll be mine.   I was only a boy when I saw my mother murdered in front of me. That does something to a man. It turns him hard, cold and makes him an addict for control. In all things.  My desires are dark and what I’m interested in is far more than simple submission. I’ve been waiting for someone as broken as me. Someone who truly needs to give up complete control and rely on me to take away her pain.  And then I found her. Katia. My kitten.   The moment I laid eyes on her gorgeous face, full lips and seductive curves, she stole the air from my lungs. It’s been so long since I’ve wanted something so intensely. She devours my every waking moment, teasing me with just a taste.  She’s stronger than she knows, but haunted by a past that won’t loosen its grip on her.  She’s refused my collar and I know why. The last one she wore wasn’t by choice.  But this time she’s going to beg for it.I can give her what he didn’t - true domination and trust. I’ll own her pleasure, her happiness and she can sate my desire for complete control.  I only need her to give me a chance. Just one chance to buy her.  The moment she agrees and steps on that stage at the auction, she’s mine. But she doesn’t have to worry, I’ll care for all her desires.  *Sold is a full-length standalone DARK romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.",
