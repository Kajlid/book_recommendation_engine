  "description": "Doctor Dire, now a full-fledged supervillain, returns to Icon City with two Find her friends, and obtain enough money to afford the next part of her sinister master plan. Only thing is, not everyone she cares about is so easily located, and she must contend with gangsters, shadowy intrigues from dubious employers, and rival supervillains. Oh, and heroes, too. Can't forget them, they're everywhere. From civil-minded super-speedsters to incompetent time-travelers, all of them want to see Dire brought down for her crimes. And when a cargo of hijacked experimental flowers turns out to be far more sinister than anticipated, she's pushed to the limit not only to survive, but also to save the world itself from a horrible fate. For a profit, of course. Villain, remember? This is the second full novel of the Tales from the Teslaverse project.",
