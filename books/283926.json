  "description": "At Estwych, Josephine had learned the value of obedience. She had tasted iron and leather; she had been abased and degraded and exalted to eternity. Her training had hardly begun. Summoned by the double blank to a life of subjection at the hands of the unknown masters, Josephine must learn to surrender completely. To surrender her bodyand her soul. In this sequel to The Domino Tattoo, Josephine Morrow undergoes the hardest trials she has ever knownand survives the greatest rewards.",
