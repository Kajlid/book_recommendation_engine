  "description": "When you're drowning in the corporate world, you'll need a mentor to keep you from going under. Bukkakeworld is the conscious evolution of the staid three-act narrative horror genre. It's a book about YOU, the corporate lackey, the indentured, the subordinate. Stuck in a job you cannot stomach, under a manager you want to annihilate, in a corporation that wants to grind you into nothing more than human grease to lubricate its inhuman profit-making machine. You are not alone. There are literally millions of you all over the world, the true Samaritans of contemporary democracy. You take it in the face every working day of your life. There seems to be no respite from your suffering, no reward for your hardship. But even in the depths of your drowning desperation, there is a light, a tiny light, beaming out to save you. She looks nothing like you. She is clean and tidy. The constant drizzle that rots everything it touches doesn't seem to settle on her. She has a light in her eyes, like a terrorist bomb exploding very, very slowly. Frame by frame, a new star blooming. She is your corporate messiah. But who is her little furry companion, Kitten? And what of the sinister chrome-like Glimpsers? How do they tie in to a swirling narrative that drags you through a death camp of corporate revelation? Bukkakeworld is a savage indictment of the corporate mentality, a challenging, twisted book that assails the underpinnings of modern society and does so much more than spit in your face.",
