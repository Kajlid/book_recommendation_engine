  "description": "Hailed as “a worthy successor to Fannie Flagg” (New York Post), nationally bestselling author Linda Bruckheimer follows up her acclaimed debut with a novel that brings back the irrepressible southern Wootens.  The Dallas Morning News hailed Dreaming Southern, Linda Bruckheimer’s first novel, as “comic…fast-paced…Vividly recreates America in the 1950s.” The Los Angeles Times crowned it “zany,” and Marie Claire magazine dubbed it ”a comic odyssey guaranteed to induce grins.”  Sisters Rebecca and Carleen, along with their daughters, are headed for Blue Lick Springs, Kentucky, where they are looking forward to reuniting with their baby sister Irene for their mother’s seventy-fifth birthday. But what begins as a road trip is really a journey of the heart for each sister as they put the pieces of their lives together before the big celebration. Rebecca decides to save Blue Lick Springs single-handedly from ruthless real estate developers bent on razing beloved landmarks to make way for parking lots. Carleen’s hoping to right the world’s wrongs with her weekly pet peeve column, but when an attractive McDonald’s executive becomes her subject matter, she finds herself reevaluating her marriage. Encouraged by Lila Mae, Irene moves back to Kentucky to live with her ninety-five-year-old grandmother. Rather than getting away from it all, she ends up hiding in the bushes of a trailer park as she investigates an insurance scheme. And their feisty mother, Lila Mae, may still have a surprise or two in store for her lively progeny.",
