  "description": "A glorious exercise in cheeky punmanship, The Wonderful Wonder of Wonders sees Jonathan Swift in fine form. Flying by the seat of his pants, the great author treats us to a condensed biography of his posterior, enlivened by some inspired wordplay. Originally a mockery of the proposed establishment of a national bank in his native Ireland, and the climate of financial hysteria that inspired it, Swift’s pamphlet contains some timely economic skepticism, as well as a healthy dose of scatological double entendres. Also including a selection of Swift’s other lesser-known works, this volume is a hilarious and illuminating read for any fans of Ireland’s most illustrious wit.",
