  "description": "Zoe Bloom has her life figured out. After a childhood spent begging for scraps on Boston street corners, she’s clawed her way to a successful career and a safe place to call home. She knows exactly what she needs to survive — a bit of money in the bank, a roof over her head, food on the table. Friends and family are a luxury she can’t afford. And forget about frivolous romantic entanglements. She can barely juggle her own problems; she certainly doesn’t have time to handle anyone else’s crap… Parker West has spent his life running.From responsibility. From obligation. From the corporate CEO position he’s always been expected to take over. He’d rather climb Kilimanjaro than sit in a board meeting with stiffs in suits. When a crisis at the family company forces him to return to Boston, he has no choice but to stop chasing adventures — temporarily. As soon as things are back in order, he fully intends to sail off into the sunset…Until he locks eyes with a mysterious blonde who screams trouble and sets his senses on fire. For the first time in his life, Parker doesn’t want to run. In fact, when it comes to Zoe… he may want to do something he’s never done before.Stay. ONE GOOD REASON is a full-length contemporary romance about a girl who’s spent her life just trying to survive… and the man who finally teaches her how to live. Due to some sexy scenes, suspenseful moments, and a foul-mouthed heroine, it is recommended for readers ages 17 and up.",
