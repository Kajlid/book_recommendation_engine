  "description": "She has less than a week to train the sole heir of Valhalla’s throne how to master the Sword of the Myst before the two of them are to face off with the biggest enemy of the throne. The throne of Valhalla is in danger as all the residents of Castle Mount had just been murdered by an unknown faction. Xanxia, the greatest swordsman… or swordswoman in the Royal Guard has just located the one remaining heir to the throne. That heir happens to be the seventeen year old son of a farmer by the name of Mercer Knight. Only Xanxia can hide him and offer her protection as they seek to find out who is threatening the monarchy. At the same time, she can’t fight the enemy alone, so she is going to need to train her future king how to master the sword and how to master the magical skills of the Myst. All the while, he wants to get to know the woman beneath the armor. It's going to take more than just some Myst to get past those protective barriers that she's built up over the years, but as much as she believes in him, he believes in her. *This stand-alone novel is written in the universe of the Colonization Saga by Scott McElhaney*",
