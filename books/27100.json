  "description": "\"There are secret passages all around you if you know where to look for them.\"Delany was being punished, and deep in her heart, past the excuses she'd like to make for herself, she knew she'd almost deserved it. And even though that girl, Mattie, had said something dreadful about her father, she knew that she should not have fought with her. Though one can never rewind history to change the past, and so this would be her punishment: to live alone in the old abandoned Greyford house on the outskirts of the Mayfield School for Girls -- a place with its covered furniture, and rooms leading to other unexpected rooms, and she would be completely, and purposefully, alone... or so she thought. Yet there was more to this house than first met the eye: there were secret passages, and hidden treasures, lost and forgotten with the passing time, and a room... a fantastic and otherworldly sort of room, which she had decided to call \"the Window Room\". This is a story about the dangerous and mysterious adventures she found there. This is a story about friends made from enemies, about a kingdom in peril, and a wrongly accused prince who would need saving. These are the sorts of things Delany found -- In the Window Room.",
