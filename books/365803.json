  "description": "Unworthy, Broken, Unclean, Raped, Hated, and Unfaithful...At some point in your life you have felt one or all of these things. These words should not condemn but be a redemption of sorts. I have seen all these words adapted to my life. All the time loving and never being loved back. Feel me when I say it was not easy to let go of the things that came so easily and not easy letting go of the excuses that I knew I could fall back on. Broken Woman was meant to be a stage play, entertainment to the men and women who love a good show. Instead of it turning into that good show it became a refresher, a renewer, and breaking of personalites that interrupted my daily life. Impending change has been a rocky road and my pending future hung in the balance. Broken Woman will interrupt your life, it will be a turbulent ride and it is the answer to... Whoops did I mention it's all about you.",
