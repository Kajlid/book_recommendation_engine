  "description": "This summer I'm leaving my hometown for a fresh start. It's a necessary choice in my pursuit of a full and sober life. Besides, escaping to the Outer Banks isn't a hardship. This seaside town holds everything I need and more. That is, until I run into Chase Matthews. He's an arrogant, cocky, self-absorbed jerk who has already come between me and my best friend once. The smart thing to do is keep him at a distance, even if he seems lost and alone. Instead, I'm compelled to help him.Chase is broken and beautiful in ways I fully understand. It's been months since I've indulged in a drink, but I've found a new obsession. He's everything I want and the last thing I need. Each day draws us closer, but I can't allow myself to get caught up in Chase. We were only meant to have the summer. A temporary fling. Yet my heart has other plans. I don't know how I'll ever walk away. Even if he costs me everything.  Start with Alicia and Chase's epic love story in Caught in the Chase, or start with Callie's book in Caught in the Flames.",
