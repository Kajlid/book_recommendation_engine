  "description": "The coffle is an elegant way of controlling and transporting women. Steel chain defeats education, skill, fitness, and desire, leaving them no choice but to walk the path chosen by their captor. Every woman has a submissive core. Often buried under layers of denial, its always ready to blossom. Natural submissives love their collars. They are proud of their submission and that a master has chosen to enslave them. Beautiful beyond reason, Amber modeled the clothes and jewelry of the world's great houses. Desired by many, she is acquired at the whim of a powerful man. Destined for his harem she is taught a courtesan's skills and a slave's obedience. Rescued by the strongest man she has ever known, the coffle still binds her. Will she ever escape its obdurate grasp? Does she want to? Reaching civilization she must choose. She now knows the joy and pain of both freedom and slavery. Any other female of our society could never forgo their long fought for equality. Their choice would be obvious. But, Amber followed her heart and chose the path of desire. \"Master, you are my master. I want you to stay my master. I have found my life as your slaver to be exciting, and more fulfilling than anything I ever knew. Please take me with you.\" \"Amber, what if you could go back home. If I take you to the US will you still want to be my slave. In a society where slavery is illegal?\" \"Yes, Master. Its not legal if you force me, but it is still what I want. I can wear these chains if I want. I can obey you if I want to. I can have you whip me if I want. I want. I want all of this. I want you to be my master, forever.\"",
