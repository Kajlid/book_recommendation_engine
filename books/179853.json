  "description": "Real Doms terrify her, so Summer plays with lightweights only. And only in the safety of her club, Dark Haven. But on Western Night, the tough cop who wins her in a sub-roping game is as powerful as they come.Virgil's first taste of BDSM was disturbingly enticing. Hoping to burn out his interest, he visits an infamous San Francisco club, where he wins himself the prettiest little submissive he's ever seen. He's in a quandary. A man shouldn't render a woman helpless, let alone spank her ass. But the nervous little submissive clearly loves being in his ropes. Her need to be controlled is as powerful as his need to control. So he indulges himself, and her.That one night could be the beginning, but instead it's the end. She won't play outside the club and he lives too far to visit often. He'll just have to find a way to forget her...or get her in his ropes to stay.",
