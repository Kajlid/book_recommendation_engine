  "description": "Ealdred is the son of no one. A half-breed slave. Born to serve.  And yet magic lives within him.  When a freak accident reveals his powers to the world, Ealdred is forced to flee for his life, only to fall into the hands of the dark sorcerer, Zeldek. Suddenly, he is thrown into a world he never knew existed. The legends are real, the Vaelhyreans of old exist, and Ealdred must choose between death and service to Zeldek.  But when he meets Bellator, beautiful and treacherous servant of Zeldek, a new choice is presented to him: to escape from Zeldekâ€™s stronghold and embark on a quest to find the cursed arrow of his ancestors and free the Vaelhyreans from the spell that holds their powers captive.  Yet how can he survive in a world where magic is illegal, half-breeds are despised, and nothing is as it seems?",
