  "description": "Bria is used to city life in Chicago, but is headed to her aunt and uncle's Iowa creamery for the summer. Their dairy operation offers a taste of country living to passersby, who can stop in for a milkshake, a wagon ride, and a trip through the corn maze. Bria is definitely out of her element, but her cousin, Wren, loves working on her parents' farm. Bria takes refuge in crushing on Gabe, who also works at the dairy, and selling milkshakes in the farm shop. But everything is in jeopardy when a corporate distributor wants to buy out the whole operation. Bria wants to add her city savvy and flair for design to the milkshake shop with crazy, over-the-top recipes. But will that be enough to save the family's farm? Bring on the tractor rides and first dates over a milkshake -- plus Suzanne Nelson's signature scrumptious recipes!",
