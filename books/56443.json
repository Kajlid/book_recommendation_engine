  "description": "Panturle lives in the village of Aubignane, in the Provencal uplands.

He knew that somewhere in a bush there was a wire noose which strangled necks that passed by.\" Aubignane was a deserted village. That autumn Gaubert the smithy, \"a little man all moustache\", left; and before the winter was out the well-sinker's widow had left as well.Then only Panturle remained, a man made morose almost to the point of madness by his solitude.

Even a village can be raised from the dead.",
