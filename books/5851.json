  "title": "The Doorway",
  "description": "\"The Doorway,\" by Dylan Tauber is the second book in the Double Mirror anthology.It is an autobiographical account of the continued spiritual journey that led Dylan to discover his theory of Ones and Zeros, the origin of the universe, and the nature of love as the defining force in all that exists.The Ones and Zeors theory came to Dylan Tauber while he was in wired Jerusalem seclusion at the turn of the millennium. \"The Doorway\" is written in a conversational informal style of writing that suited this chronology beginning with the book \"Double Mirrors.\" The last half the book is more of a journal and culminates with an escape to a Pacific island where Dylan could work without distraction, and also relates other travels throughout the South Pacific, Central, and South America, swims with dolphins, and even an adventure with a hula dancer named Eve.",
