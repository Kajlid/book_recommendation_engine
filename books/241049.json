  "description": "“Harlow Hampton meets the Iris Boys.”  All I needed was a break. A sign. Something.  Nearly getting run over was not the sign I was looking for, but it’s what I got. That and a group of guys who say they work for something called Iris.  No, thank you.  I had enough to deal with, thank you very much. No brother. No dad. No sanity most of the time. I certainly didn’t need to be dealing with thieves and wild cats and guys that were way too good looking. That is…I didn’t need them until they were all I had left. Now I have to make a decision about my future and whether or not they’re going to be in it.  ***This is a Reverse Harem title***",
