A very real person, an enticing girl of flesh and warmth - who detested the sunlight, who required the blood of young men to feed upon, who was all that Dracula was said to be except never one of the \"undead.\" Sabella was alive, sensual and dangerous.She lived on Nova Mars, a colony of Earth and very much like the world we know. She knew what she was and her very existence was a peril to the all-too-human population of that world.Never since C. L. Moore's Shambleau has there been another like Sabella.",
