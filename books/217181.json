  "description": "[Alternate cover edition for ASIN: B00Y9KSSX8]What would you do if Russian mobsters wanted to torture and kill your entire family? Natalie Lancaster grabs her sons Bill, 13, and Tommy, 11, and they run for their lives. They must leave everything behind—their possessions and their past—in a desperate attempt to survive.  To throw the killers off their trail, they buy false identities from a shady dealer. But there’s a problem—the only identities available for the boys are as middle-school girls. The horror of being caught by the killers convinces them to unwillingly masquerade as girls and continue running. But changing cities, names, ages, clothing, and even their gender, can’t keep the truth from themselves—they never really were the people they thought they were.  They make a Pact to stay boys, no matter what they’re wearing or what their new names might be. But Tommy finds that acting like a girl has stopped being an act, that he may be transgender, while Bill doesn’t want any part of the masquerade.  Meanwhile, the killers get closer …  A companion to the books Desperate Measures and The Network.",
