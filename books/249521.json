  "description": "Some secrets refuse to stay buried…  Ruby Monroe lost her mom at a young age, and she'd always believed it was due to a car accident. When she finds proof stating otherwise and starts asking questions, strange things begin happening, including the certainty she’s being watched. When a call for help is answered by the town’s sexy new dark-haired deputy, she knows her life isn't the only thing in danger, her heart is too.  The truth has a way of being revealed…  Ryan Daniels is burnt out. He loves his job as a detective, but when a recent case results in the criminal going free, he knows he needs a change. When his dad's old friend mentions his small town is hiring, Ryan takes a step toward a new life. What he didn't plan on was meeting the woman of his dreams, nor that he may lose her after just finding her.  Who will be left standing in the end?",
