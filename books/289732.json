  "description": "With sharp characterization and dead-on satire, this book collects some of the sharpest, funniest stories about American life ever set to paper. Butch, Buddy, Babs, Mom and Dad redefine \"nuclear\" as in fissionable! Meet the Bradleys, America's most dysfunctional Pops, Mom, Buddy, Babs and Butch Bradley. This volume collects all of Bagge's early, explosively funny pre- Hate tales of the dysfunctional Bradley family from Neat Stuff , including \"You're Not the Boss of Me!,\" \"Merry F*cking Christmas!,\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll Refugee.\" The best-selling humor cartoonist of his generation, Bagge has been hailed as one of comics' great satirists along with James Thurber, Harvey Kurtzman, and Matt Groening. The Bradleys remain his most enduring creation. Created in the 1980s while Bagge was also editing R. Crumb's Weirdo magazine, this family for the ages has its roots firmly planted in All In the Family 's Bunker family and MAD magazine, with a healthy punk rock anger occasionally explodingâ€•think of an R-rated Simpsons and you're close. 160 pages of black-and-white comics",
