  "description": "\"What Kinda Cactus Izzat?\" is an authentic \"who's who\" of Southwest desert plants. It is not cluttered up with Latin botanical names, but it will give you a friendly introduction to all the principal thorny inhabitants of the Cactus Belt along the Mexican Border. This book not only calls a cactus a cactus, but more important, it points out what Not to call a \"cactus\". You'll learn about the lilies that carry swords; about the Giant cactus that wears shoes to keep from getting dry. And here you'll find revealed such intimate facts as which cacti have hair on their warts, and which have the groved tubercles.",
