  "description": "Priscilla has reached a crossroads. Her spells are becoming more frequent. She can't continue to pass for humanâ€”not without making a decision that would turn her into a zombie. Does she embrace her unearthly power or turn her back on it forever? If she refuses her birthright, she'll be ordinary, human. It would also mean bidding farewell to the gorgeous denizen who visits her each night, taking her to otherworldly heights of pleasure. Priscilla has to make a choice...over the most seductive coffee she's ever tasted.",
