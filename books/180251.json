  "description": "Passions become obsessions. Obsessions become manias. And sometimes, manias turn into nightmares. What happens when one wants so badly that all else, including sanity and self, is consumed by the bonfires of desire? What happens when one achieves the dream, only to discover the nightmares lurking behind the illusions? Firbolg Publishing's fifth anthology, Enter at Your Own Risk: Dreamscapes into Darkness, explores the old adage of \"Be Careful What You Wish For.\" Journey down wishful thinking's twisted pathways and discover what dark ends and detours await-with an introduction from Daniel Knauf, and featuring stories from D.H. Lawrence, Mary Shelley, A.M. Burrage, H.P. Lovecraft, and more Gothic masters from yesteryear and today... enter at your own risk, and be careful not to make a wish!",
