Anyone who gets too close to Easton becomes a target for his enemies, so although this girl makes his once-dead heart beat out of control, he can only offer her one night of unparalleled passion. Love has no time limits, however. And before Easton knows it, he'll be in a rush to keep the girl of his dreams safe...and in his life forever.",
