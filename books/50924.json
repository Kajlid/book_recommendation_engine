  "title": "Studying Paul's Letters: Contemporary Perspectives and Methods",
  "description": "Studying Paul's Letters provides a survey of the most relevant current methods in Paul scholarship. Joseph A. Marchal leads a group of scholars who are also experienced teachers in courses on Paul. More than a series of \"how-to\" essays in interpretation, each chapter in this volume shows how differences in starting point and interpretive decisions shape different ways of understanding Paul. Each teacher-scholar focuses on what a particular method brings to interpretation and applies that method to a text in Pauls letters, aiming not just at the beginning student but at the \"tough choices\" every teacher must make in balancing information with critical reflection. Studying Paul's Letters is organized for use in a single semester course on Paul and is perfect for graduate students, seminarians, and undergraduate students.",
