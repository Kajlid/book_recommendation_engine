  "description": "From Bestselling author Kelli Callahan comes a Holiday Romantic Comedy centered around a woman who is fed up with Christmas, has no intention of ever falling in love, and totally plans to ignore the hottest guy she’s ever laid eyes on.  I don’t care if all of the people I work with call me Elly-nezer Scrooge behind my back. I don’t care if my family judges me because I haven’t been to a Christmas dinner in years. I don’t even care that I spend every single holiday alone. I’m happy.  I’ve said that so many times that I think I finally believe it...  Then my cousin signed me up for the Secret Santa Romance dating app. And I got matched with Ian...  Sure, he’s hot, charming, and checks every single box I can come up with on the perfect guy list but there’s no way he’s going to convince me to go on a date with him or change my perspective of Christmas with his corny jokes.  So why can’t I convince myself to stop talking to him, delete this stupid app, and get on with my life?  This is a full-length standalone Romantic Comedy.",
