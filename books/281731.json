  "description": "The infamous photographer of Mediterranean youths, Wilhelm Plüschow, has returned to his native Germany after receiving an invitation to attend a family reunion. This is surprising as, after many scandals (all deserved), none of his relatives will speak with Plüschow except his cousin von Gloeden, also openly homosexual and a more successful photographer, one respected in the art world.Plüschow soon finds himself suffering from ''unconscious inferences''...or perhaps what he truly sees are spirits. What happens to the eyes of a man who has spent a lifetime of ogling boys with or without a camera? Can Plüschow suffer the indignities posed when these spirits peer back at him?",
