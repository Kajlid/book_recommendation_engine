  "description": "Rain fell against the roof and the windowpanes, sealing them in together in their den of antiques and crumbling books and the nail polish bottles lined up in the dormer ledges. It was all so ordinary and human; the only monsters were them, just the way he liked it.  **A short story prelude for Lauren Gilleyâ€™s new Sons of Rome Series: a character-driven paranormal series with historical and contemporary storylines. Book one, White Wolf, releases later this year.**",
