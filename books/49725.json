  "title": "To Kill a Stranger",
  "description": "Harry is a former professional soldier down on his luck, a tramp on London’s streets and, like so many other ex-servicemen living rough, preoccupied with finding something to eat and somewhere to sleep. When an old comrade offers him a second chance and a great deal of money to do what he’s best at – killing strangers – it seems a no-brainer. Only it isn’t for Queen and Country, but a covert organization that’s been privatized along with so much else of Britain’s once proud public services. At first all goes well, but Harry realizes too late that shooting defenceless, unarmed civilians in London’s well-heeled West End is a far cry from combat in Britain’s ‘small wars’ - the Falklands, Iraq and Afghanistan. Harry discovers he has a conscience. To refuse a contract is to become a target. He must deceive his new employers if he’s to continue to enjoy the lavish lifestyle of a professional hitman. It’s only a matter of time before Harry is found out and transformed from predator into prey, culminating in an explosive showdown in the Scottish Highlands.",
