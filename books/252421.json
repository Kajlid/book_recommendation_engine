  "description": "His pick-up truck was not new anymore. It was a friend now- dusty gray, comfortable, the way a vehicle becomes when you give it a name. The steady hum of the motor produced a sort of hypnosis that dulled his anxiety. He looked ahead to the western horizon and pushed the accelerator to the floor. Heat rose from the black top and mirage serpents slithered across the surface and disappeared as he approached. It had all been a mirage. He hated himself for being deceived, for allowing himself to be deceived.",
