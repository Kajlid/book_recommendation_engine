  "description": "When Rose Ashford sees a boy about to be devoured in a harvester on her family’s farm, she has no other choice but to teleport him to safety. For Rose is a shifter. One of rare few people who can teleport themselves to any person, place or object they seek. It is a rare, genetic ability that her brother, Dean, told her never to share with anyone outside their family and her best friend Kip.  But it is too late for that now. Unknowingly, Rose’s extrasensory talent has appeared on the radar of the same government organisation that once trained her brother: The Endeavour Sector. An organisation Dean told her never to sign up with under any circumstances.After Dean dies, however, the money for their family farm in Texas quickly evaporates, leaving Rose with no other options. She must join to receive the generous sums of money her family has been promised or starve. Anonymous, benign in manner, yet also sinister in its instruction, the Endeavour Sector immediately takes Rose to be trained at their desert hideaway. Constantly monitored by cameras, taken from their families and even their own countries, Rose and her friends are gradually pushed into a war with a rising terrorist organisation that will kill millions if not stopped.But who are they working for? Is the Endeavour Sector their enemy as Rose fears, or is it their ally?",
