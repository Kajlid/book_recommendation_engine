Now, another forces him to face up to the future and to promises he failed to keep.Six years earlier, Elizabeth Hamilton wasted her one season by falling hopelessly in love with Robert Deverell, then her life was blighted by loss and poverty. Now, she must marry or find a post as a governess.So when Mr Deverell himself offers her a marriage of convenience, upon his terms, she is dumbfounded. But when she realises that this cool stranger is no longer the tender, funny man she cannot forget, Lizzy has a few terms of her own.Both will need to surrender ground to rediscover the love they lost. But even as Lizzy finds that 'her Robert' may still be alive within the cold Mr Deverell, it seems that death still stalks her husband ... and perhaps even herself.Rich in historical detail and determined characters, this powerful romance will sweep you up into a love story and an adventure that you won't want to put down.Author's This sequel to The Reluctant Lady follows the stories of some of the friends introduced in that novel, but also stands alone as Regency read.For those familiar with The Reluctant Lady, youâ€™ll discover what happened to Dev, Gil and Denny after they left for Newmarket, and see Charles and Harry return to support their friends.However, in places this is a rather darker novel than the first. So if you are looking for a light, frothy romance, this may not be the book for you.",
