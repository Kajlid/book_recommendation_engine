They would never guess my strange history. But secretly I'm still held down by my past. I cannot bring myself to trust men.So why do I find myself drawn to the most dangerous one of all?Oversexed, foul-mouthed and ten years my senior, he should have been my nightmare.Instead, he's my fantasy....Deck...How many women have I ruined?Hell if there's any point in counting. Only once did I ever do something unforgivable and the consequence crushed my soul. Maybe that's why I remain here, in the barren desert wasteland occupied by the worst of my degenerate family.This is a prison I've inflicted on myself.Into my purgatory walks Jenny; feisty, beautiful, but little more than a girl.No one decent should want a thing to do with me.I told her that.She didn't listen.Note: Fall is a crossover between the Gentry Boys series and the Defiant MC series. Characters from the Gentry Boys as well as the book Promise Me figure prominently. However, Fall was written as a stand-alone and it is not necessary to have read either series.
