  "title": "The Caperton Project",
  "description": "There have been strange goings-on in and near the small rural Midwestern town of Caperton for a very long time. Everybody sees it. Everybody knows it. Children disappear, babies disappear, the elderly disappear. A few understand why it is happening. They say that all will be well. Will it? The town is home to some memorable characters and some people who know more than they tell. Some think alien abduction is happening, but for what purpose? Others investigate the military. A small group of fifth graders try to find their missing friend and discover themselves in beyond their depth. Social workers, sleep-study doctors, a minister, the local eccentric, retired military, and a host of other characters take the reader on a journey of discovery in this action-filled sci-fi mystery,",
