  "description": "In 2045, as Islam has overrun Europe and the West openly shuns monotheism, the Vatican-funded CERN Laboratories 'discover' that time travel is possible. The Pope orders the creation of a private army and, led by a few handpicked Cardinals and the finest graduates of selected war colleges, they travel back in time to 312AD - the reign of the first Christian Emperor, Constantine. Upon arrival, conflicting agendas, ideological differences, and personal greed see grand plans unravel. Pax Romana is the tale of 5,000 men sent on an impossible mission to change the past and save the future. At the end of the world, will they succeed, or will they fail? This politically driven sci-fi epic comes from the creator of the hit Nightly News!Collecting: Pax Romana 1-4",
