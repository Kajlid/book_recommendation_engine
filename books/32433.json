  "description": "I am Seraphine LaLande, VoooDoo Priestess in training.You may be asking yourself what a person has to do to become a voodoo priestess. I'm beginning to ask myself why I even bothered down that path.You see, I come from a long line of voodoo practitioners, but that doesn't mean they simply hand me the title. I have to earn it by successfully completing specific tasks. Unfortunately for me, and everyone I hang around too long, I tend to screw things up a bit where magic is concerned. Then, I get the not so wonderful tasks of cleaning up after myself.My magical malfunctions aren't all bad, they brought me to some new friends, some living, some dead, and some more who were more trouble than they were worth! Join me on my journey. I can't promise everything will go smoothly, but I can guarantee that you will at least be entertained!",
