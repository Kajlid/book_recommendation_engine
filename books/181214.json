  "description": "Kallie wants to return to Los Angeles. She and Marcus come out of their quiet and peaceful existence in a small Northern California town nearly a year after the last encounter with their pursuers, but who is the mysterious young person who appears in their remote sanctuary and disrupts the illusion of safety under which they have been living?An audacious teenager who carries the time-travel gene, hardly more than a child with all the knowledge of a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time, will risk everything to enlist Kallie to be his would-be savior. Kallie still has reason to fear Mason, her pursuer who is obsessed with time travel and has spent his entire adult life obsessively hunting down that secret, even resorting to murder in the past.An impossible and unbelievable discovery about time loops, which the scientists insist are not viable, destroys the foundation of all that Kallie thinks she knows about time travel and forces her to make an impossible choice that may put events into motion that will have terrible consequences.Swayed by her best friend's devotion to saving him from being lost forever, Kallie is compelled to compromise everything she holds sacred to save the adolescent from the danger of blinking out of existence. The charming and disquietingly confident teenager responds to the anomaly of his existence with flippant remarks and quoting from a Stephen King novel, while Kallie nurtures a fear that the young man might in fact be the ultimate temporal weapon.The fourth book in the Chronicles of the Harekaiian series will present concepts of time travel and reality that leave readers thinking long after they turn the last page..",
