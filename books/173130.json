  "description": "Tired of being average? Have you ever wished there was something special about you? Be careful what you wish for. Josh Thorne was as normal as they come until he neared his eighteenth birthday. Over the course of one month this young man’s life was forever altered by forces beyond his control. Psychic visions, werewolves, demons, cults, ghosts, and vampires become all too common as he fights to keep his friends safe. His best friend Keith stands beside him throughout this journey but as the events in Josh’s life become stranger it becomes apparent that Keith may not be human either.  Even in the middle of fighting for his life, Josh meets the woman of his dreams. He finds love and helps others do the same. With love and laughter, Josh finds the strength to keep going. Josh learns of love and loss, pain and forgiveness, as well as leadership and responsibility on his journey with friends both new and old. Graduating high school becomes secondary when you are just trying to survive.",
