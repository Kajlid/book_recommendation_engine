  "description": "What happens \"after\" the worst happens?Before May 31, 2008, September Vaudrey's life was beautiful. But on that day, with one phone call from the ER, her whole world--everything she knew and believed--was shaken to the core. Katie, her 19-year-old artist daughter, had been in a car accident and would not survive. How does a family live in the wake of devastating tragedy? When darkness colors every moment, is it possible to find light? Can God still be good, even after goodbye?With the depth of C. S. Lewis's \"A Grief Observed\" and the poignancy of Joan Didion's \"The Year of Magical Thinking,\" \"Colors of Goodbye\" offers a moving glimpse into a mother's heart. Combining literary narrative and raw reflection, September Vaudrey walks through one of life's worst losses--the death of a child--and slowly becomes open to watching for the unexpected ways God carries her through it. It's a story of love and tragedy in tandem; a deeply personal memoir from a life forever changed by one empty place. And at its core, \"Colors of Goodbye\" calls to the deepest part of our spirits to know that \"death is not the end . . .\" and that life can be beautiful still.",
