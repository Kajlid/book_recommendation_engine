  "description": "\" The Mackenzie men are legendary. Strong, independent, passionate and single-minded, they take what they want no matter the rules! Catch up on these classic novels by beloved author Linda Howard, collected together for one low price! Bundle includes Mackenzie's Mountain, Mackenzie's Mission, Mackenzie's Pleasure, and A Game of Chance. In Mackenzie's Mountain, Wolf Mackenzie is a loner with a way with horses and a deep distrust of outsiders -- until one woman dares to venture onto Mackenzie's Mountain. Schoolteacher Mary Elizabeth Potter is determined to keep Wolf's teenage son from abandoning his dreams -- and finds herself rescuing Wolf along the way. In Mackenzie's Mission, Night Wing -- the revolutionary test plane with a top-secret weapons system -- was Colonel Joe Mackenzie's number-one priority. And weapons expert Caroline Evans was his number-one distraction. True, the stubborn blonde was giving him the cold shoulder, but Joe hadn't become the best of the best by giving up. Then he discovered someone on the inside was sabotaging Night Wing, and with her late hours and specialized expertise, Caroline seemed the obvious choice. Now Joe had to choose between allegiance to his country and love for his prime suspect.... In Mackenzie's Pleasure, no mission had ever gotten the better of navy SEAL Zane Mackenzie -- until now. Barrie Lovejoy needed a savior, before the terrorist group holding her hostage lost patience and silenced her -- forever. Rescuing Barrie would be the most important mission of his life. For he would sooner die than let the enemy harm the mother of his child. In A Game of Chance, in an attempt to lure a vicious criminal out of hiding, agent Chance Mackenzie uses his quarry's estranged daughter, Sunny, as bait. It doesn't take long for him to win her trust -- and her heart -- but what Chance hadn't guessed was that Sunny had reasons of her own to be hiding from her father. Now his deception has brought them both one step closer to danger.\"",
