  "description": "7 years agoFrom the moment Alexandr Novikov met the young auburn haired woman bartending at her uncle's pub in Ireland, he'd been fascinated by her delicate beauty and fiery spirit. Unfortunately, he is in no position to offer her the kind of safe, normal life she deserves so he attempts to put her from his mind for her own good. Something easier said then done when a deal is struck between the Novikov Bratva and the Irish Cleary Gang, an arrangement that includes Alex and his men being on twenty-four hour bodyguard duty with the object of his forbidden desires.Jessica Venture came to Dublin to spend some time bonding with her birth mother's family, a connection she desperately needs after losing her adoptive parents within a year of each other back in the States. The last thing she expected was to fall in love with a handsome, mysterious, and sometimes scary man who was well known for his sexual appetite, but rejected her attempts to seduce him.There are outside forces that will do anything to keep them apart, and Jessica will have to make a desperate choice that will change their lives forever. There is light bondage, domestic discipline, spanking, and a F/F scene that is a voyeuristic Doms delight.Author's This is part One of Two for Alex and Jessica's story. In Alexandr's Cherished Submissive we get a look into the past and the events that shaped Alex and Jessica into the people they are today. Part Two, Alexandr's Reluctant Submissive, is present day on, and is out now.",
