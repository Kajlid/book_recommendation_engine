  "description": "On stealing the dreams of a warrior and priestess, Chaos discovers two essential ingredients for his dream alchemy. With such souls the dark god can release his daughter, Babalon, from Hell. Once the devil queen returns and swallows the eyes of the angel who damned her, the veil separating reality from the Abyss will tear, and Chaos pour forth to warp Dragonland. Can Sol defeat Chaos and save Dragonland? Or will Babalon's poison kiss seduce him? Through the psiqnet, a network of human minds and Quantum Artificial Intelligences (QAIs), consumers shop Earth towards ecological ruin. The preachers of Gaia, ecoterrorists woven within the system, seek to bring economic and ecological harmony through Gaia QAI. Yet as Gaia begins to infect other QAIs with compassion, the Blood Plague rises, intent on exterminating humankind. Who entangles the fate of Earth and Dragonland?â€‹",
