  "description": "Sometimes the past didn't stay in the past.  Secrets had a way of coming out.  Paige Daviess had built herself a new life, a good one. One with meaning and purpose. As an agent with the best FBI division in the country, she knew she was good at what she did. She was making a difference, protecting vulnerable children from the horrors she'd faced when she was young.  One of those horrors had returned to haunt her.  He was determined to take from her everything she had earned. And make her suffer while he did it.  Mick Brockman wasn't about to let that happen. They'd fought each other from the moment they'd first met, but the Internal Affairs agent would do whatever he had to in order to protect the dark-eyed woman who pushed his buttons faster than anyone he'd ever met.  Anything.  Including bending--breaking--the rules he'd sworn to uphold. No matter what.",
