  "description": "My name is Rylee and I was a Tracker.The final battle is over and The Blood of the Lost was spilled. In the aftermath, the humans still have mysteries they call upon me for. Except I can no longer Track, and my new abilities terrify me.\nA salvage is offered to me, and with it a chance to redeem myself. A missing girl, her brother desperate to find her. Simple and straightforward, this salvage should be a piece of cake - and a chance to learn some discipline with my powers.Except the girl is somehow tied to the world of the Elementals, and with that comes a danger I could never have expected.As I search for her, I realize it is not only her life that is on the line, but my soul and sanity as well, as the voices and unnatural needs in me grow more demanding.If I am to save us both, I must face the darkness within; and this time, I must do it all by myself.",
