  "description": "%Young Zebedeo is between boyhood and manhood when he and his father Majid are joined by Balthazar, a warrior-priest from Babylon, and Liu Shang, a Chinese mystic and astronomer from the east.The men travel across the desert to Jerusalem on the belief that their journey is a simple one, to follow a star-prophesy and worship a new king. Not long after, they meet the tyrannical King Herod who dispenses a warped idea of mercy to his subjects on a blood-soaked throne room floor. The military commander and captain of the elite guards Severo, serves as Herod's right hand and will stop at nothing in his quest for position and wealth--even if it means leading a slaughter of all the first born children in the region to appease his master.Zebedeo, Balthazar and the other Maji quickly learn that the real reason for their journey is to save the life of the new king, no matter the cost.",
