  "description": "Sandi and Kiera are best friends and live together in Sandi's apartment. Sandi is a successful model and her photographer is in need of more models. She's had strong feelings for Kiera ever since they moved in together, but she's kept those feelings to herself. She'd like nothing better than to help Kiera realize she'd be better off with a female who loved her. A second job as a model would allow her to save more money and realize how beautiful she is.  Sandi's relationships with men were ruined long before she even hit her teens and the men in Kiera's life only keep her around when they need to abuse someone. Kiera has tried to make her relationships work, yet unsure of why they don't.  Can they become closer if they shared even more? Read the beginning of the story and see what you think. This is part of book one in my new series, Through His Lens.",
