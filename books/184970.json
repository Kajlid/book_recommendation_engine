Do you believe that you have to do certain things, be a certain way to deserve certain things in your life? Do you believe that you need to have a special value, determined by yourself and/or others through a special set of criteria, to attain certain things, have certain kinds of relationships, etc?This manual is powerful and clear, and will bring you clarity on this word that will definitely change your perception on who you are and how worthy you are. This book gives you Clarity, Release and Connection on this Clarity is gained by giving you accurate definitions in order for you to understand and, in this context, give your own meaning, your personal identity and label to words and concepts.
