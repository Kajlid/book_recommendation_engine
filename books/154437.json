  "description": "In a world where the boys wore make-up and highwaymen ruled the roads, Terry Deary has uncovered some of the horrible truths about the Gorgeous Georgians in this riotous addition to the Horrible Histories range.  In this, another howling success for the series, famous villains like Rob Roy, Dick Turpin and Blackbeard, who all became folk heroes over time, are given the once-over by the sharp-penned Deary as he tells the truth about their lives of crime, leaving little doubt as to what they were really up to when they were on the run.  From poor hygiene and terrible food to a country overrun with body snatchers and thief-takers, the poor old Georgians didn't stand much of a chance in a country run by unsuitable politicians and less than stable monarchs, and Gorgeous Georgians wastes no time in taking a stab at this seedy side of Georgian life. --Susan Harrison",
