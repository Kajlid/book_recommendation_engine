  "description": "The year is 2117. Dhungwana, the only remaining dry land on the planet Earth, is governed by the Federal Communities. Humanity, organized through a strict social reputation index, lives to the dictum \"I belong, ergo sum\".Ian and Dayla, the main characters, have a brilliant social life until Dayla accidentally intercepts classified financial data concerning her employer, the BlueGray Corporation, while Ian identifies genetic modifications that have appeared in one of Dhungwana’s main food sources. As a result, their lives and social reputations become complicated and their crystalline everyday life is filled with an obsessive and terrifying sense of déjà vu. The deaths of two distinguished colleagues, hastily dismissed by the authorities, force Ian and Dayla to open their eyes and discover their only allies are the banned of Dhungwana, and their only option is to fight against the reality of a world that is no longer theirs. It is a fight for the survival of the human race.",
