  "description": "It has been over two years since the dead began to walk. The shattered remnants of civilization continue desperately to try and rebuild society...for better or for worse. As far as Meredith Gainey is concerned, they can do it without her help. Fixated on a mysterious radio message, she sets out on an unlikely adventure. This time she is joined by her dog and an unlikely companion. Eric Grayfeather. On her journey, she will encounter everything that is good and bad about humanity. Everything from a group of children who have no trust left in adults, to an all-female clan who lure men to their doom using themselves as live bait. It's all there, and it only serves to prove Meredith's point that maybe the world would be a better place without humans. As always, she documents her travels, allowing you to see the dead world through her eyes. This is The Final Entry",
