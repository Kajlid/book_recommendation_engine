  "title": "Harry Potter and the Problematic Author",
  "description": "A Harry Potter fan comic, created in response to the \"Magic in North America\" stories, JKR's transphobic tweets and The Witch Trials of JK Rowling. This zine isn't an attack on the books, it is a critique and a meditation on loving flawed media. This zine was originally written in July 2019, then updated in 2023. The whole story can also be read for free online at the author's website.",
