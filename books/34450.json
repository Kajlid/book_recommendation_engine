A wonderful introduction to philosophy for the neophyte, and a joy for the experienced student. \"Peter Kreeft's work (1) unfailingly brilliant, (2) intellectually agile, (3) astonishingly perspicacious, (4) gloriously orthodox, (5) Chestertonianly aphoristic.\" -Thomas Howard, Author, On Being Catholic \"Imagine two of the most influential thinkers of all time, and two of the most diametrically opposed, thrust together in a no holds barred debate about some of the most important Does man move the world or is he only a puppet of forces beyond his control?
