When his shy niece begs him to take a ballroom dancing class, Jon agrees, aware he’s not Fred Astaire material.

She’s prepared for anything—except her immediate attraction to the bad boy rocker who doesn’t know his right foot from his left.As Jon sets out to prove he can rock his body—and hers—their sexual chemistry burns a path across the dance floor, straight to the bedroom. And Maggie wasn’t expecting a man with limited dance skills would know exactly how to sweep her off her feet. Sweet and hot…this couple knows how to bump and grind.",
