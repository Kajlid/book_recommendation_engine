  "description": "When the power-crazy Most Royal of Fire Dragons decides he wants to rule not only his own hot southern kingdom but also the icy wastes of the Snow Dragons' northern territory, catastrophe occurs. The Fire Dragon ignores the warning from the powerful Book that Twolegs will eventually destroy his kind, and sets out crisping and frazzling the world. Little Tuft, a Twoleg, can't ignore the warning and enlists the help of the last remaining Snow Dragon in a thrilling and magical quest to save the world from burning up...An entrancing story, lyrically told and gorgeously illustrated, which will be appreciated on a variety of levels by children from pre-school to 8-year-olds and older.",
