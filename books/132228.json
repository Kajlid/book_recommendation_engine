  "description": "Issai's had enough. For over five thousand years, he has been successively reborn with all his previous lives’ memories intact and relentlessly compelled to wander the earth as though drawn to a point that is continuously changing. Over the centuries, whispers of others similar to him began to surface, and his kind became known as Old Souls, revered by some but mostly creatures to be feared.Unable to find answers for his seemingly endless existence and no longer willing to play in what he fears is just a game for the gods’ amusement, Issai abandons his wanderings and questions and settles in an isolated town, determined to resist the strong urge to be on the move that has dictated his entire existence.However, after a brutal attack by the Shi, a secretive group of fanatics that believe consuming an Old Soul will grant them immortality, he is confronted by Hahri, a loud-mouthed Old Soul who offers him his first hint to the mystery behind their compulsion. Issai not only reluctantly finds himself in pursuit of the answers he had once forsaken but also running from a relentless enemy whose unprecedented numbers suggest that immortality may no longer be their only goal.",
