  "title": "The Quadrant War",
  "description": "Sixteen-year-old Kiah and her family struggle to survive in this dystopian society, formerly known as the United States of America. Citizens experience extreme loss and devastation, and Kiah is no exception. Although she doesn't grasp the reasons for The Quadrant War, she clearly understands the impacts of the war. Hope of peace and freedom is nonexistent, until Kiah begins to view her soul-shifting ability as a source of powerful guidance rather than just something else that makes her awkward. With the help of her first love, she's on a journey to fulfill her destiny. Soul-shifting reveals important knowledge that sometimes comforts her and at other times terrifies her. Will Kiah fall prey to the overseer and his forces, or will she triumph and see her life and the lives around her changed forever?",
