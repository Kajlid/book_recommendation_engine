  "description": "Lonestar. His name fit him perfectly. It fed every fantasy that Gussie Horton had conjured about Indians and forbidden love. His neighbors whispered that he was a murdering half-breed, which was true. But Gussie believed in second chances, and more importantly, her heart told her to believe in Max Lonestar. Was she a fool to hitch her wagon to his star? Would he be her one true love or her final downfall?",
