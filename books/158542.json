  "description": "Devin Abernathy secretly dreams of escaping to a simpler time. It's why she owns a vintage clothing shop, fulfilling her lifelong fantasy of surrounding herself with period style. All she has to do is slip on a garment to be spirited away to a bygone era--in her imagination, anyway. But lately she's also dreamed at night of a passionate affair with a handsome World War II naval officer named Gregory Prescott, who seems oddly familiar.Fantasy becomes reality when Devin dons a mysterious estate-sale coat and is suddenly whisked back in time--to New York City in 1945 on V-J Day, where she's welcoming Gregory home with open arms and ruby-red kisses.... All she wants is to stay in his powerful embrace, but to do so means choosing between his past and her future.",
