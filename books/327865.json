  "description": "Step into the glittering midnight world of the ancient ... the immortal ... the vampyre. Intrigue welcomes Captain Vincent Bantry home to London in 1892: he's a veteran of the Far East, opium smugglers, Manchu warlords, but little in his experience prepares him for the young Irish occultist, Michael Flynn. Their future unfolds in the Tarot cards - danger, pain, struggle; but the end of their story cannot be told. And what of the past? The mystery of Flynn draws Bantry into an occult world, alien and irresistible. Instinctively he knows Flynn is different, not merely beautiful, brilliant, exotic, but unlike any other man he ever knew. Soon Vince is caught in a tangle of deceit, danger, one jump ahead of the law, and seduced by the grandeur of a midnight world into which he's glimpsed ... and which he desires.",
