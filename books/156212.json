  "description": "When the peaceful world of Correll came under attack, from the brutal and savage Gunoi, everyone expected the Confederacy to come to their aid. But help never came. Years of fighting backed them into a corner, and facing complete annihilation their leaders made the greatest mistake imaginable. They stuck a deal with the demonic entity Drak'Nal, trading the souls of their soldiers in return for the power to defeat their enemies.Three hundred years later, Nariko and the other survivors of Corell are still searching for a way to free themselves from their involuntary enslavement to Drak'Nal, but they are running out of time. Every time they die, their curse brings them forcibly back to life. Every day they lose more of their humanity, lose more of their true selves, and darkness takes its place.Nariko had always clung to her faith to give her strength, but now the Luminarch no longer answers her prayers and a second, darker persona is growing within her threatening to swallow her whole and claim her cursed body for itself. All she had left was her pride as a soldier, and now, even that is stripped away from her as she is transferred in disgrace to the Seventh Division, whose leader Inami has gone completely mad from the curse. Inami believes that she has found the key to end their crusade and claim their freedom, but how can Nariko place her faith in a madwoman?",
