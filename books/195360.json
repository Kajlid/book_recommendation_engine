  "title": "King of Hades",
  "description": "In the violent and ruthless world of Hades, a teetotaler is trying to carve a niche by himself; His quests to prove his innocence. Untangling himself from the shackles of pain & humiliations; He fought the odds with the basic instinct of a human being to prove his worthiness to those around him. “R.A.M.Z.I!....I’ll cut your heart out & throw at her feet. I’ll feed you to Jackals.” A story of betrayal, cold–blooded murder and the rise and eventual fall of Underworld, Kings of Hades is an action thriller tangled with spices of romance, adultery, crime and a mirage of the world around us. It is a grand tour of underworld with modern and semi modern existence.",
