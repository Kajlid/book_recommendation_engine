  "description": "For fans of Edith Pearlman, a stunning debut collection of short stories about aging, relationships, and intimacy.Scary Old Sex, a debut collection of short stories, was written and rewritten over a period of thirty years. In her youth, Arlene Heyman had been a promising young writer, studying with Bernard Malamud at Bennington College and earning an M.A. from the prestigious Syracuse University program. But her life changed course and she entered medical school, writing only in quiet moments between her full-time work as a psychiatrist and raising her family. Now, after decades of writing for her own pleasure, these mature and accomplished stories will be published to wide acclaim.In this taboo-breaking debut, Heyman, a practicing psychiatrist, gives us what really goes on in people's minds and relationships--those things unspoken in much of society, about sex between older people, or about sex and love when one person is very ill, or when the age difference makes the relationship practically illegal. Love and sex in these stories are seen, sometimes, through the wide-open eyes of women, with women often in dominant roles in relationships. A few of the stories are raw, many are unsettling, but all are insightful and at times humorous, looking behind the curtain at the intimacies we usually keep to ourselves. Not intended to be titillating, Heyman's stories give us the lives we all live: the real, the sloppy, the human.",
