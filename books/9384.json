When she calls for help, the SWAT Commander and his team of four gorgeous men come to her rescue.

She can’t give in to temptation this time, no matter how desirable the brothers. The Valdamar brothers are a pack of Alphas hired by the government to keep the peace. They discover their mate, but she refuses to reciprocate their advances.
