  "title": "Keppan: An Artist's Blood Oath",
  "description": "A world-renowned Japanese artist has a unique style that can never be forged, since each piece of art is signed with a stamp dipped in his own blood. He is so popular, that at his first gallery opening in five years, he sold every piece. The day after the opening, however, he was found dead at the bottom of Topanga Canyon. Pushing against department politics, two LAPD detectives are assigned to the case. Hercuree Lewis comes from a family of accomplished female artists, and her younger partner, Toni Nicholas, is smart and tech savvy. Together they unravel a forgery plot that links a ransomware chat window with clues to the shadowy Yakuza underworld. Ultimately, this is the story of a brilliant artist who chooses his commitment to his craft over true love.",
