  "title": "Cupcake: Sticky Sweet Duet",
  "description": "From the time I was able to hold a ball, I have lived and breathed football. It controlled every aspect of my life. The game consumed me, that was until I met a sweet, feisty blonde, pastry chef named Pippa Montgomery. The moment I laid eyes on her, she turned my world upside down. Now all I want is to live and breathe her. Grayson Bennett looks like the all-American boy next door, but beneath his sweet, charming personality beats the heart of a dirty talking sex god, who with a single touch of his hand brought me to my knees. My career has always come first, my show, my cookbooks all took precedence over my relationships, that was before I met Grayson. Now all I want is him. They say some love stories are complicated, but our story gets a little sticky. This is an over the top HEA with lots of ridiculous smutty fun.",
