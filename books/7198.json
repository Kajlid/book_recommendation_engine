  "title": "Kensey's Story: Meeting Death",
  "description": "14 year old Kensey is on vacation. Vacation that suddenly turned better... or maybe worse. Her little brother and new friend force her to climb down a long, dark well. What she finds down there... is another world inhabited by mythical creatures. Centaurs, Pixies, Vampires, Wizards, Lycanthropes, and a lot more. She meets a Fairy, Marcus, and lots of new friends... as well as enemies. Enemies that want her heart-broken, off guard, and dead. One way to achieve that goal is to kill one of her new friends, someone that was more than just a friend. To counteract that goal, she promises her new family that she will bring him back to life by, somehow, journeying to the Kingdom in the Sky, a legendary, fabled location where the souls of the dead are transported. Will she make it there? Or will the haunting, yet enchanting, Hooded Figure kill her in the process for infecting his world with Humans?",
