What she doesn´t expect are the villagers´ concerned faces, her fiance´s remoteness, or the nagging voice in her head that whispers to her of fears she didn´t even know she had.Something in the woods is beginning to stir, to creep closer to the sleeping houses. Something that should have been banished long ago.Whatever it is, it´s getting stronger, and pretending it´s not there won´t keep the wedding, or the village - or Chloe - safe.",
