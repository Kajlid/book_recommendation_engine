Hans travels to Alabama where he solicits Kapp’s help to find Adok. Kapp recruits two of his WWII buddies to join the search. Now a team, Hans and Kapp’s quest to rescue Adok reveals a more sinister plot that may plunge the world into another global war and eventually lead the alliance back to Germany.
