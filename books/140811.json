  "description": "Fourteen-year-old Ellis has been living with her grandmother for as long as she can remember. For Ellis, every year is a new town, a new house, a new school. Every year is spent wondering about the next year, never any closer to discovering her purpose in life, making lasting friendships, or learning about the parents she lost when she was four. . . . Until this year. . . . This year, Ellis starts Ida May High School where she meets Starling. Like many Ida May students, Starling’s parents work for Connor Glass. When Ellis learns that her own parents were research scientists for Connor Glass and that their accidental discovery led to their disappearance, life changes quickly. But as Ellis uses the device her parents invented to unravel the mystery behind their disappearance, she unexpectedly learns about life’s fragile path and the necessity of choosing one’s destination — a destination that may depend on a thread.",
