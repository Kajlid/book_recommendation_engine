  "description": "\"Javitt has written a grab-you-by-the-throat thriller that could easily be tomorrow's lead news story. Under the guise of a compelling read lurks a keep-you-guessing plot that should cause any intelligent reader to worry about the safety of us all. An intrepid female physician, a town full of bad guys, and the safety of the American people at stake. Seems like a surefire recipe for success.\" -- Janet Rehnquist, former Inspector General, Health and Human Services",
