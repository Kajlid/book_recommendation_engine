  "description": "Ollie is drowning. No one notices.  Oliver Campbell, fourteen, fanciful and funny in equal measure, struggles to unravel the knots of emotion when his little sister, Lily, falls gravely ill with a mysterious disease. Irritating and puzzling to his two older half-brothers, neglected by his self-absorbed mum and dad, and unfalleninlovewith by Poppy Teasdale, he longs to be something more than invisible.  Quirky Kamal doesn't think it's weird that Ollie, his best friend, is fascinated by words and plants; he knows what it's like to be different and to be bullied; he coaches him on love, and how to clinch his dream-girl; he tickles him with his highfalutin language and aspirations; he impresses him with his fortitude despite a tragic past; he is there when his life takes a terrible turn; he is loyal to the end.  Ollie's two special people throw him life jackets, but will they be enough to save him...?  Readers who savoured Jenny Valentine's \"Broken Soup,\" Frank Cottrell Boyce's \"Framed,\" and Joe Dunthorne's \"Submarine\" might also approve of my novel for the 12+ age group, which I hope will appeal to boys, girls and adults alike.",
