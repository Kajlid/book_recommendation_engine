  "description": "Kings, wise men, or magi?  They came from the East and brought gifts to the Son of Man. Some called them magi, while others named them wise kings who had seen a star. But who where they, really? Were they rulers, astronomers, philosophers, or something else?  We Three Kings is an adventure, a spiritual journey of discovery, and an extended prayer. It asks simply: What would you give up in order to follow a star, a dreamâ€”Jesus? When would the burden be too much or the trail too narrow?  Tested, beaten, and tempted, the three kings stuck to their faith, and it brought them to God.  The three kings gave away everything to follow a star: their kingdoms, money, power, and even their own identities. Did they make the ultimate sacrifice?",
