  "description": "This book is no longer available as a stand-alone.Diesel LeBlanc notices MacKenzie Rhodes ice-skating on a pond in their hometown and decides he has to have her. He makes no secret of his desire – or the casual nature of it. He finally gets what he wants…on her terms…and heads off to live the fabulous life of a professional hockey player.Years later, a chance meeting brings them together again and Diesel realizes she’s the one woman he was never able to forget. He’s ready to prove that he can be a man worthy of her heart. Is she ready to trust him with the life she’s built?Diesel and Kenzie’s story is the first novella in my collection “Love of the Game” – a four-part series of stand-alone novellas that feature a lead character involved in professional sports.These are not “sports stories” with an erotic romance twist. They are erotic romances with a character who happens to be an athlete. I hope you like reading them because they were a lot of fun to write!",
