  "description": "HOW DOES A BLONDE SPELL 'FARM'?E-I-E-I-OTressa Jayne Turner has had it up to here with the never-ending string of dumb-blonde jokes and a longtime nickname that's harder to get rid of than lint from a belly button. Dubbed 'Calamity Jayne' by Iowa Department of Natural Resources officer, Rick Townsend, Tressa's out to gain a little hometown respect--or die trying. Unfortunately, that may be the case. She's just been handed the perfect opportunity to get \"Ranger Rick,\" the doubting Don Juan of the DNR, and a skeptical citizenry to take her seriously. How? By solving a murder no one else believes happened...No one, that is, except the killer.",
