  "title": "Foreign Faction - Who Really Kidnapped JonBenet?",
  "description": "Over 15 years have elapsed since JonBen√©t's body was found in the basement of her Boulder, Colorado home. Diametrically opposing theories of her kidnap and murder were publicly espoused by Boulder Detective Steve Thomas and retired Colorado Springs investigator Lou Smit in 2000 after a grand jury failed to announce an indictment, or release an official report regarding their year-long inquiry into the matter. This was the last time that any authoritative law enforcement voice stepped forward to explore the innermost details of this unsolved murder investigation. Foreign Faction blows the cover off the lone-intruder / sexual predator theory, and reveals startling new evidence that heretofore has only been seen by a select few. Kolar's work offers an entirely new perspective for the events leading up to JonBenet's murder on Christmas Day 1996, and it will ultimately redifine the public perception of one of the most unusual murder investigations this country has ever witnessed.",
