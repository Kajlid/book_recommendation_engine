  "description": "When the heir to MacKlenna Farm, paramedic Kit MacKlenna, discovers she is not who she thinks she is, she uses the magic of the ruby brooch to travel back in time to the mid-19th century American west to uncover her true identity. Her coming-of-age quest leads her down a dangerous path that could cost her not only her heart, but her life. Scottish lawyer Cullen Montgomery has a well-planned future that doesn't include an eccentric, risk-taking woman, but that doesn't stop his defenses from slipping when he sees Kit risk her life to save her traveling companions. Will Cullen stay his course and fulfill his commitments in California, or will he surrender to the only woman whose heart beats to the same rhythm as his own?",
