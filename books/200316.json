However, news of her father’s capture and execution by the Parvac Empire throws Teagan’s life into turmoil. Fearing her Parvac grandfather, General Valen, plans to abduct her, Teagan is desperate to avoid her grandmother’s fate. Never again to see Yukihyo or her family is a nightmare that forces Teagan from the stars to remain on Arachne.
