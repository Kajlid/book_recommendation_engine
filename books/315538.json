A big story is exactly what Jennifer Buckner needs to take her career to the next level. Despite transforming the morning news on \"Hello Moose Creek\" from blah to the number one watched local show, something is missing in her life.Like Jennifer, Duke d’Angelo Diamante knows he’s missing out in life. If he had a teammate and partner, he’d finally prove to his family that he’s ready to take over the thriving jewelry business; after all, nothing says \"stable\" and \"committed\" like marriage.When these two team up—in matrimony—to take on the world, they soon learn that they’re compatible in more ways than one. (Wink! Wink!) But can they stick together and keep their vows when Duke’s family intervenes? Or will they give into the pressure and go their separate ways?",
