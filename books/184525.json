  "description": "All she wanted was the house her father had promised her, a house whose shell sat as empty as her heart ...The year is 1883, the place the Washington Territory, and Agnes Farwell still mourns the death of her father less than a year before. To Agnes, anything or anyone connected to the man her stepmother married soon after cannot be accepted. William Tyrell, foreign to the ways of farming, seems intent on destroying the farm on which she was born and raised.When William hires Hope Lawson as governess to Agnes' four younger siblings, Agnes reacts with hostility to the newcomer and all she represents. Slowly, though, she finds her feelings for Hope changing in a way she could never have imagined.But even as Agnes finds the strength to break free of William's power and finish the house her father had started, William shows that he has one more trick up his sleeve. This time, his intentions could prove fatal for both Agnes and Hope.",
