  "description": "Ovid’s Valley used to be a sleepy mountain town…Aaron Mitchell has lived there his entire life, waiting for a rare storm to arrive. He just never wanted to admit it until now. Mocked as a child for his odd aroma and affliction with electrical devices, he turned to nature as a means to escape the derision. Now an adult, Aaron is a trail guide for hikers and horseback riders at Wickline Lodge. When his special quirks start to amplify and evolve, the delusion that he is normal—held by himself and those around him—hangs on by a thread. The opening of a government building along the outskirts of town shakes the residents out of their collective slumber. Members of the strange organization housed within begin to reach out to him. Aaron must choose between continuing his comfortable, humble existence or step out into the unknown, willing to embrace what he has worked so hard to cover up.
