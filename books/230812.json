  "description": "No man left behind . . .\nMarine Sergeant Joshua Caven\nJosh finally has his shattered personal life in some kind of order. He has found the family he never knew he had, and thanks to them, he can do his duty and complete his deployment in Afghanistan, knowing his baby daughter is safe. It should be smooth sailing . . . until Chris Young—the living, breathing reason his wife abandoned him and their baby—is assigned to his unit.\nCorporal Danny Benton\nDanny knows the Marine Corps basically saved his life, but he still feels guilty for joining—escaping—and leaving his younger brother to deal with their alcoholic father. But there's nothing he can do except be the best Marine he can be and to come home and marry his girl. He has no reason to think she won't wait for him—until a Dear John letter arrives.\nHospital Corpsman Chris Young\nIt's hard enough to be a sand sailor working with a group of Marines, but when his unit is headed up by the man he unwittingly betrayed, it definitely gets uncomfortable. Then an encounter with local hostiles goes horribly wrong and both men are wounded. And while Chris's wounds aren't serious, the guilt is eating him up. Because his Sergeant is in the hospital, fighting for his life. All because he saved Chris's . . .A Marine does his duty, no matter what. But what none of them expects is to have their upended lives suddenly made even more complicated by . . . love.",
