  "title": "The Upanishads: Translated and Commentated by Swami Paramananda From the Original Sanskrit Text",
  "description": "The Upanishads are early philosophical texts of the Hindu religion. The Upanishads represent the loftiest heights of ancient Indo-Aryan thought and culture and are regarded as direct revelations of God. Because these teachings were usually given in the stillness of some distant retreat, where the noises of the world could not disturb the tranquillity of the contemplative life, they are known also as Aranyakas, Forest Books. This version is a translation of Swami Paramananda. Paramananda was an important Swami, mystic, poet, and an innovator in spiritual community living. Wilder Publications is a green publisher.",
