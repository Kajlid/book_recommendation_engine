Division, fear, entitlements, and class envy are tearing the nation he loves apart. Why doesn't someone do something about it? If efforts are made to change the direction of things, will someone be upset enough to try and stop it? To what lengths will either side go to stop the other? Spare Time, a novel about the issues the real world and the United States face, takes a fictional look at real solutions to real problems. Everyone is busy, but maybe we can get something accomplished ... in our spare time.",
