  "description": "He’s the hunter. I’m his prey.   I've been sleepwalking through life—not living, just existing—working toward a future where I can actually breathe.  Until HE walks in.  Gabriel Jackson. With his boy next door charm and dimpled grin, he jolts me awake. He makes me want to feel the dark heat he promises. To live in the hunger lurking behind his brown eyes.  But life isn't a fairy tale, and things aren't always as they seem. My Prince Charming is the devil in disguise. A wolf in sheep’s clothing. And I’m the sacrificial lamb.  He may have had ulterior motives when we first met. But now, the fallen angel is my guardian angel. My knight in tarnished armor. My Not So Prince Charming.   From USA Today, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post Bestselling Author Lauren Landish comes Not So Prince Charming, a new dirty fairy tale retelling. Prepare for a nail-biting and swoon filled ride!",
