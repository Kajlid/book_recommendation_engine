  "description": "Welcome to the world of shidduch dating.  Like any world, it has its stereotypes. We've got the stingy guy and the superficial girl, the too-religious, the not-religious-enough and everyone in between. Those who are in it because they want to and those who are in it because their moms made them.  And mostly we've got the pressure. Pressure, pressure, pressure on all ends.  Basically, it's a lot of fun, a lot of tears, a lot of arguments and some love.  I'm sure you'll relate.  ***  Shidduch dating: an Orthodox Jewish method of dating in which singles are introduced for the purpose of marriage. Also, an intense and short period of time in which said singles are expected to make a life-altering decision. These short stories highlight some repercussions that may arise. A humorous, uncensored, thought-provoking perspective.",
