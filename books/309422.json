  "description": "Fact: I don't do well with change.After tragedy struck our family, routine has become a strategic and essential part of my life.Eat. Work. Sleep. Repeat.It gives me control.It eases the war raging inside my head.It's monotonous and boring as hell, but I'm good with that.Until my baby sister throws a spanner in the works.Live. Laugh. Date.Those were her words.Despite the fact it gives me hives, I do just that.I reconnect with old friends, and I sell the dingy little apartment we used to call home—I even take an impromptu trip to New York.But during said trip to NYC, I don't expect to fall (quite literally) into the arms of an older guy who won't take no for an answer.Rick's almost twenty years older than me, but he has the power to tear down my walls, destroy my comfort zones, and obliterate my limits.I shouldn’t be drawn to him, but I am.I shouldn’t let him in, but I do.I should fight this undeniable attraction growing between us, but I can't.My peaceful, sightseeing trip to the city that never sleeps might just turn out to be the best decision I've ever made... or the worst.",
