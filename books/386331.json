  "description": "Ricky Fallon had decided not to kill himself after all―moments before accidentally slipping off a bridge and plunging to his death. Now he’s a Cupid in the afterlife, helping high school students fall in love. The job would be cool if it weren’t for the dorky pink bodysuits, his jerky boss, and attacks from joy-sucking shadowy entities called Suicides. When Fallon discovers a dangerous new Suicide in human form, a terrific battle erupts. Before the Suicide can become too powerful, Fallon has to convince his fellow Cupids of the extraordinary threat, protect the girl he’s falling for . . . and foil the Suicides’ evil scheme to spread despair to all humanity. Timothy Carter’s Evil? was named to ALA’s 2010 Rainbow Project list for GLBTQ Books for Children and Teens Praise:“Full of funny scenes, humorous dialogue, an interesting cast of characters, and plenty of entertainment. Once again, Timothy Carter has penned a winner.”―CM: CANADIAN REVIEW OF MATERIALS",
