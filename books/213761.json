  "description": "Return to Sea City and Penny Caspian's oceanfront hotel! Not only are rogue dragons real, they’re attacking my hotel. Every few days, there’s another one, terrorizing me, my unborn baby, my boyfriend Lachlan Flint, my friends, and my guests. I have to figure out what’s drawing them there and stop them from coming, if only because Clarke Gannon the dragon slayer keeps showing up, and I don’t much like her. Lachlan and I are dealing with a case involving stolen magical artifacts and a gargoyle matriarch who doesn’t have much faith in our skills. When the case and the attacking rogues converge one day, we run smack into Lachlan’s past. He used to work undercover for magical narcotics, and now the vampire gang he infiltrated might offer our only hope to stop the rogues and protect our child. But to do that, we’ll need to go undercover again, into the depths of the dangerous magical underworld.",
