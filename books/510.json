But this love is impossible. After all, she's his boss and he lives with his girlfriend. But his \"girlfriend\" turns out to be his boyfriend, a gentle and beautiful supermodel. Resigned to a platonic friendship, she accepts a weekend invitation, but the men have far more passionate ideas. They want her to \"be a part of them\". A three-way love defies propriety and the strict rules of her University. The supermodel's fame makes secrecy impossible. The menage threatens her carefully constructed world. Something must be given up. Someone's heart will be broken.",
