  "description": "A secret duo of romance authors team up under the New York Times & USA Today Bestselling pseudonym Max Monroe to bring you more from their sexy, laugh-out-loud new series. Can you ever get enough Billionaire Bad Boys?  Blissful in Bora Bora…  Kline and Georgia Brooks are fresh off their wedding and ready to indulge in the honeymoon of a lifetime.  Luxurious and private, their overwater bungalow in the South Pacific is the perfect backdrop for fun, sun, and enough sexiness to necessitate a dip in the clear water to cool down.  But marriage means more, and Kline and Georgia may have to find a different way to handle the heat.   Nowhere near normal in New York…  Thatcher Kelly loves wild women, and Cassie Phillips is about as wild as they come. Put them together and they are a match made in chaos.   Bound by cat-sitting responsibilities, Cass and Thatch have to find a way to right their mistakes—and wade through the dense cloud of sexual tension that seems to suffocate the room whenever they’re together.   Will they be able to resist?  And more importantly, will Walter be okay?",
