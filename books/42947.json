Happily married, raising a beautiful daughter, and enjoying time with her best friend Mo, Donna is finally living the life she’s always dreamed of - free from soul-stealing, kidnapping, and murder. That all changes when Donna, on her way to the store for ground beef and spaghetti noodles, crashes her Mustang straight into the Underworld’s most dangerous and vengeful deity. And far from desiring an apology, this merciless goddess expects blood. Now dinner’s on the back burner, the planet’s on a collision course with Chaos, and the only way out is down.Final Hour of the Hunter is book three in the Midnight Hunter trilogy.",
