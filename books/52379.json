  "description": "Master storyteller J. V. Jones (called \"a striking writer\" by Robert Jordan) weaves an unforgettable tale of ambition, betrayal, and the indomitable strength of the human spirit. This epic fantasy of enormous scope, set on a world peopled by fascinating, compelling characters, is a sharply observed saga of a cold, splintered world on the brink. A thousand years ago, war shook the land. Now, chaos has erupted. Clans vie for dominance; dangerous, arrogant clan chiefs urge their followers into frenzied battles, killing each other and plotting the defeat of their rivals despite those among them who seek unity. But for all the vicious contention among the clans, a darker threat comes from Spire Vanis, a city with a black heart of evil, whose rulers have long sought to control the clanholds. In the midst of the chaos, a few extraordinary people wrestle with personal A born killer with only love and loyalty in his heart; a young woman whose mystical destiny is shrouded in her unknown past; a young man betrayed by his own brother; and a clanswoman who would do anything to save her folk. Each alone seeks only survival, but together they hold the keys to a world's salvation. At the publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management software (DRM) applied.",
