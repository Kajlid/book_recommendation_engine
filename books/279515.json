  "description": "Declan Forbes has always been the black sheep in the family, and he likes it that way. The less people liked him, the less drama he had to deal with. But the thing about being a loner was a person might find themselves . . . lonely.Working for the FBI, Declan liked his world the way it was, even if something was missing. He’d also take a bullet in the gut before admitting anything was wrong. Something was off, though, because from the moment he meets Angela he’s a goner. She’s in the midst of the case he’s been trying to crack for the past few years now, but he’s not exactly sure how she’s involved and she isn’t talking.One thing Declan has learned in his years in the Marines and the FBI, though, is how to get a person to talk. It could even be . . . fun. This is the final book in the four book series, Undercover Billionaires. It can be read as a stand-alone. Each brother has his own book.",
