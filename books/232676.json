  "title": "History of McGowan's Brigade: South Carolinians Known First as Gregg's Brigade",
  "description": "J.F.J. Caldwell was an officer in McGowanâ€™s Brigade and published this brigade history in 1866, right after the Civil War. He takes us on a journey with the brigade from its beginning until the surrender at Appomattox. He tells of its involvement in many of the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia, including Second Manassas (Bull Run) Antietam, Gettysburg, the Wilderness, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville, ending with Appomattox. His style is appealing and accurate. Robert E. Lee himself complimented this account as one of the best written in the post-war years.",
