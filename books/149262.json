  "title": "Grace for Drowning",
  "description": "From the New York Times, USA Today and Wall Street Journal best-selling author of The Alpha Group comes a new romance about the devastating power of guilt and two people’s struggle to overcome their pasts.   Hope is a dangerous thing. I know that more than most. Everything good I've ever had has been stolen from me — my friends, my fiancé, my innocence, some would say even my sanity. All I have left is the cage. Fighting is the only thing that eases the ache inside me even a little. It’s the only thing that keeps the bottle at bay.  I was content to ride out my life alone. I was done dreaming that things could be better. But then I met Grace, and from that moment, all I could do was dream.  She's battling those same demons, only she's losing. I don’t want to care, but something about her calls to me. That pain in her eyes is so sharp, so familiar. I know it’s only a matter of time before it pulls her below the surface.  I can help her, and maybe, just maybe, she can help me too. For the first time in what feels like forever, I've got hope, and that scares the hell out of me.  This book is told from dual perspectives, so both Grace and Logan get their say. It is a full length (300 page) novel with no cliffhanger. There is likely to be a sequel, but the story can be enjoyed alone.  Not suitable for younger readers. This is an intense story that deals with issues of alcoholism and military PTSD, and it contains adult content.",
