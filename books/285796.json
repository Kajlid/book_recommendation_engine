After Ray left to join the Army, she put her unrequited crush behind her. Over the next five years, she fell in love, married, and started a family. Only her happy life was shattered when her husband was killed eight months ago. Being a single mom was never her plan, but Stephanie’s doing the best she can for her daughter. However, danger may be closing in after she witnesses activity that may tie her husband’s unsolved murder to a drug smuggling operation.  Elite soldier Ray Lundgren has been following orders since high school—even when his best friend forbid him from dating his sister. On leave following a deployment, Ray is back in town when a desperate Stephanie turns to him for help. When he takes charge to help protect her and her daughter, the attraction both tried to deny years ago reignites.  Ray’s time home is running short, so when the police ask for Stephanie’s help to get evidence, they go along with the risky plan to crack the case. When danger emerges from an unexpected source, this time Ray disobeys orders from the authorities, but will he be able to get to Stephanie in time when not only their shot at love, but her life, is in jeopardy?",
