But the League doesn't approve, and gives him one last chance to prove himself. A high member of the council has died, and the League believes his mistress, killed him.

But when he encounters the red-haired beauty, Robert is convinced of her innocence and is determined to find the real murderer, no matter the price.

She's uneasy with her instant attraction to Robert, and when she learns his purpose to prove her guilt she knows she can never trust him...",
