  "description": "Young Pegeen, one of the good friends Francie made on his trip around the Emerald Isle, has just lost her Grannie. When she is told that she can't stay on alone in the small mountain cottage, Pegeen remembers Francie's promise to come for her someday. With Fr. Kelly's help she writes to the O'Sullivans, to be welcomed temporarily into their household. No one, except perhaps Francie, is quite prepared for Pegeen's knack of turning the world up on end. Her spirit is a perfect match for his, but two such personalities in one small cottage on Bantry Bay have startling consequences.Ireland, 1930'sRL4.9Of read-aloud interest ages 5-up",
