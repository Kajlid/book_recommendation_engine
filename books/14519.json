  "description": "The Michaluk Virus is loose. In the heart of Atlanta, Georgia, the Michaluk Virus has escaped the CDC, and its effects are widespread and devastating. Most of the population of the southeastern United States have become homicidal cannibals. As society rapidly crumbles under the hordes of infected, three people—Ethan Bennett, a Memphis police officer; Cade Alton, his best friend and former IDF sharpshooter; and Brandt Evans, a lieutenant in the US Marines—band together against the oncoming crush of death and terror sweeping across the world. As Cade, Brandt, and Ethan hole up in a safe house in Tupelo, others begin to join them in their bid for survival. When the infected attack and they’re forced to flee, one departs to Memphis in search of answers while the others escape south to Biloxi, where they encounter more danger than they bargained for. And in Memphis, the answers that one man finds are the last answers he wanted, answers that herald a horrific possibility that there may be more to this virus than first suspected. “Fast zombies become slow zombies become kick-ass.”—Peter Clines, author of EX-HEROES and EX-PATRIOTS “I can’t wait for part 2 to be released … it’s definitely an entertaining must read. Great job Jessica—two CrackBerry thumbs up!”—CrackBerry.com “From the chilling opening scenes to the tension-filled climax, Jessica Meigs has crafted a story that reminded me that zombies are really scary.”—Kevin J. Burke, author of THE LAST MAILMAN",
