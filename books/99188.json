  "description": "Candice runs to the shadows. Too much light has been shed on once dark corners of her perception. That's because she's discovered an ancient process to reveal hidden truths and share human memories. And the visions she's had as a result reveal things about a friend named Brenda, who is a daring journalist working the political beat for a newspaper in Los Angeles, her former fiance named Ted, and a prior boyfriend named Justin, who was a colleague in a research lab at a major university. Candice sets out to acquire more evidence about the memory sharing process, a journey which takes her to the northern reaches of the Sonoran Desert and a small town built near a mysterious fossil excavation site. Candice soon learns more than she ever wanted to know about her friend, former lovers, corporate corruption, and the paranormal mystery that must be uncovered in order to save thousands. And herself.Equal parts psychological thriller and urban science fiction, Remnant Truths also falls into the emerging category of New Adult (elements of romance and strong female characters who are older than 18). The novel is based on the award-winning short film also by the author. The book is currently available on Amazon.",
