  "description": "It’s all fun and games until someone goes missing, the Cuerpo Nacional de Policía show up, and Abi loses everything she really cares about.When Abigail takes a week-long vacation to Ibiza with her best girls for her hen party, she expects sun, sand, and a little bit of drinking. Okay, a lot of drinking. But she doesn’t expect her mother to show up and start romancing an elderly tourist. Especially when dad is holding down the fort at home. Or to find herself being swept away by a multi-millionaire on his yacht. Or that one of her besties would betray her deepest secret and her fiance would call off the wedding.Join Abi and the girls for rollicking fun in the sun and a little back-stabbing and nail-biting thrown in for good measure. A must for your summer reading list!",
