The price of the rise in rank was his betrothal to the daughter, Adria. At the time it seemed a small price for a big gain - even if Brand had to endure Uncle Aaron and Adria's inane babbling about him being the little tyke's fated soul mate.Brand became a man in the same household where Adria grew to be a girl and then a teenager. At first, Brand lived there so that Aaron could train him in his duties. But just a few years after the betrothal, Aaron committed suicide, jumping to his death from the same cliff where his late wife had died a few years earlier. Brandon became the Duke of Warren and found that the power and wealth of the position fit him well. He balanced duty and honor with a rather devoted pursuit of pleasure. As the years passed and his young betrothed matured, the price that seemed small to the youth seemed too much to bear to the man who considered Adria a little sister.Adria inherited the North family's famed \"sense of direction.\" Her father sensed that Brand was her fated soul mate.
