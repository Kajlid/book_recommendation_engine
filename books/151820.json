Her plans and dreams for the future seem distant and unattainable, and she is bound by a promise to care for two young adults who are struggling with a loss of their own. Continuing their journey north to the goldfields seems their only option, and Adrik Ivanov agrees to be their guide. With a late start and the constant threat of winter hastening their pace, Adrik wonders at the wisdom of their decision. But he longs to prove his commitment and growing love for Karen, who has pushed aside his advances in the past. Inspired by the beautiful and rugged landscape, Karen thrives under the difficult conditions of their trek. As her heart begins to journey back to the core of her once-solid faith, will she dare to embrace the love offered to her?",
