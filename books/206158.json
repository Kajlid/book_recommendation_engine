  "description": "Elsa Vogel has left her cinder’s life behind to sail with her companions aboard the Sovereign as it embarks on an exploratory mission. The crew’s destination is past the star bell, the last marker of civilization, into uncharted territory. Elsa is determined to find out what lies beyond the star bell or perish in the attempt. But life aboard a Fleet frigate isn't at all how she dreamed, and old ties to the Tremaine Mining Company—and to her past on Anser—are not so easily severed.Pick up the story where A Cinder's Tale, published in the internationally best-selling anthology \nFive Glass Slippers\n, left off! And don't miss the first volume in The Cendrillon Cycle, \nThe Battle of Castle Nebula\n.",
