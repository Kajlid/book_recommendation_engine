  "description": "You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you.When Lucy visits Italy with her prim and proper cousin Charlotte, she is on the verge of an experience that will throw her neatly ordered life quite off balance. Back in England, she finds that her relationships with her family, with the unconventional Emersons and with her supercilious fianc√© pull her between the social and sexual proprieties of her upbringing and the spontaneous promptings of her heart.And, of course, it is the heart that wins in this sunniest and most readable of Forster's novels.",
