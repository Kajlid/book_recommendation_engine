Alex, someone she spent only one night with, seven years ago now. A perfect night. A night that makes her soul glow when she tells the story. A soul mate night.Seven years on, with the memory of THAT night relegated to the realms of pure fantasy, Honey marries Ed, her nice suitable man, and unbeknown to her on the other side of the Atlantic, Alex marries another woman. As fate would have it, Honey and Alex do meet again. But what happens if they meet completely by coincidence, on a balcony in New York - even if they are both on their respective honeymoons?",
