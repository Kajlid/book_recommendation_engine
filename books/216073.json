  "description": "They hunt us. They bomb our worlds for target practice.  A star cluster in the constellation of Orion rotates once every thousand years. Those who rule there have an ancient tradition: When each cycle ends, they train their fleets by spilling the blood of lesser beings.  The enemy fleets are coming again. In response, the Rebel Worlds gather their starships to face the terrifying threat, and this time humanity is asked to stand with them.  The last time they considered Earth, Vikings in longboats were raiding English coastlines. Today, we’re less primitive. Today, we're a target.  One man is chosen to command Earth's single ship in the Rebel Fleet. When the war breaks out, Leo Blake must win it… or die trying.  “Classic B. V. Larson. This book grabs you by the plasma cannon and won’t let go. Fast adventure, fast action--and I loved the space-battles!” - S. Arthur",
