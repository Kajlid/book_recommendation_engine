  "description": "How much can one person go through until they break?  The chains around Lilly’s wrists are gone. The doors once locking her in, unbolted. But Lilly Hooper is as far from free as could be.  Her magic has been stolen, and her power and freedom are held ransom by her coven leader. Grayson's obsession with furthering the Arcane bloodline, and his unrelenting desire to complete a dangerous spell, returning magic to the world, has consumed him. He is ready to destroy anyone who gets in his way. His brother, his coven, even Lilly Hooper herself. No one is safe.  In the shadows, Lilly’s enemies are closing in. Toby is far from finished with his obsession to regain his control over her mind, body, soul and magic. Hunters are gathering. And Lilly’s past returns to haunt her far more than any nightmare ever could.  When the missing six weeks of her memory reveal a heartbreaking truth, everything changes. And not even Gabriel may be able to stop her from seeking the revenge she so desperately craves.",
