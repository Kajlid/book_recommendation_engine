  "description": "Draven Blackmoor is a monster. A nightmare who haunts my dreams.A vampire who stalks the night, hunting for his next victim. The ruler of a modern kingdom that dwells in the darkness. And I’m his only light. I possess a power that makes me wanted by his enemies. He promises to save me by offering his crown. I have no choice but to marry him and become his queen. But I won’t fall for his seductive charms.I’m forced to live in his castle and spend time with him. Forced to prepare for a wedding to a man who frightens me into believing his lies.  Wicked royalty with no chance of redemption. There’s only one thing he can’t force upon me—himself. Yet, the fact he stays away has me yearning for more. I find myself memorizing every curve of his chiseled body. The possessive way his sinewy muscles flow each time he stalks closer. The sensual way his lips curve upward in a sinister smile each time he talks to me. His hungry, dark eyes make promises he’ll never keep. If it’s my blood he’s after, I’d quickly give him mine. He’s irresistible. And that thought terrifies me. So much that I sneak away and escape to the mountainous terrain of the haze-shrouded forest. I’ll take my chances with the evil waiting to capture me, rather than risk my heart to a man without one.However, I’ll never be ready for what’s waiting for me there.",
