  "description": "Levi Quinn has it all—money, groupies, a panty-melting smile, and a really big d*ck.  At least, he had it all. Until an angry redhead joined the Taint world tour and turned his life upside-down. Levi fell in love with her. His bandmate did too. It did not end well.  Brielle Kagawa doesn’t keep company with rock stars, but when this gifted cellist finds herself kicked out of the Orchestre de Paris an all-expenses-paid gig in the south of France seems too good to be true.  Because it is.  The man footing the bill might be a disorderly drunk, but he has an offer she can’t refuse—stay in his chateau and play for the month. No strings attached.  Yeah right.  The truth about rock stars is that they’re awfully good players, but Levi isn’t the only one who knows how to master a set of strings.  He’s broken-hearted. She doesn’t have a heart to break.  * Intended for a mature 18+ audience only. This book may contain triggers for some readers.",
