  "title": "Star: A Novel",
  "description": "There was just something about her... Like many twenty-one year olds, Star Wood Leigh works two jobs to make ends the day shift at Talon's Nail and Tan Spa, and the night shift at Mother Pearl's Steak & Oyster Emporium. The archetypal tomboy at home in jeans and a T-shirt, Star is guileless but beguiling, a fresh-faced beauty who knows that too much of a good thing is wonderful. A loving daughter, a good friend, and a faithful girlfriend, this Florida native leads a full life with more than her share of sun and fun. And yet, she lives with a spider sense that something is missing. It was her beloved grandfather, Papa Jens, who urged her to embrace all that life has to offer. Accepting this advice, Star is shocked to learn that an innocent evening at a football game can set off a chain of life-altering events. One minute she's cleaning the tanning beds at Talon's and the next she's being primped and prodded in preparation for the cover of a national magazine. What a difference a day makes. Playful, bawdy, and curl-your-toes-sexy, Star is a breathless romp through tinseltown and tabloids. An insider's look at the world of inflated egos and inflated bodies, Star goes well beyond the clich√©d air-kisses and casting couches of Hollywood to show what really happens when A-list meets D-cup, when girl becomes goddess.",
