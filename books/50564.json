Recruited by the gods for her uncanny medical skills, she's the best M*A*S*H surgeon in the army. Along with a nosy guard sphinx,vegetarian werewolf, and otherparanormal paramedics, she bandages soldiers who are built like Greek gods (literally). But when one sexy immortal ends up on her operating table—half dead and totally to-die-for—Petra's afraid she'll lose her patient and her heart…NOTHING IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN LOVECommander Galen of Delphi is one gorgeous but stubborn demi-god. When his spirit tries to slip out of his fatally wounded body, Dr. Petra has to slip it back in—unwittingly revealing her ability to see ghosts.

Heaven knows—all's fair in love and war…",
