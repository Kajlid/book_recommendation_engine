But when a creditor's threats lead her to stumble across a midnight meeting, Theresa discovers that Grandfather is hiding far more than the money he owes. And the secrets he kept now have Theresa trapped in a life-threatening fight for her home ... and the truth.After months of undercover work, Secret Service operative Broderick Cosgrove is about to uncover the identity of the leader of a notorious counterfeiting ring. That moment of triumph turns to horror, however, when he finds undeniable proof that his former fiancï¿½e, Theresa, is connected. He won't believe the woman he loved is a willing participant. Protecting Theresa and proving her innocence may destroy his career, but that's better than failing her twice in one lifetime.Broderick and Theresa must form a partnership, but there's no question they're both keeping secrets. Lack of trust, along with the dangerous criminals out for their blood, threatens their hearts, their faith, their very survival.",
