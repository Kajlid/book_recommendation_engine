  "title": "Magnificent Obsession: Victoria, Albert and the Death That Changed the Monarchy",
  "description": "After the death of Prince Albert, the grief of Victoria and her nation was so profound that this one event was to dramatically change the British monarchy. Drawing on sources ranging from Royal Archives to popular newspapers, this study offers a new perspective on a compelling historical drama - the crucial final months of Albert's life and the first long, dark ten years of the Queen's retreat from public view - and it overturns the myth that Albert died of typhoid fever.",
