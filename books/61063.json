  "description": "\"As long as no one asks and they don't tell \"First class petty officer Eric Randall is less than thrilled about taking orders to Okinawa. Three long, lonely years on a crappy island that's thousands of miles from his daughter? Oh. Yeah. Sign him up. But as long as he's stuck here, he might as well make the best of it, so he discreetly checks out the local gay scene.Shane nearly drops his drink when the gorgeous, cocky-looking guy strolls into Palace Habu. He buys him a drink, and before long, they're making out in a booth. Eric is a straight-to-the-point kind of guy and doesn't want to play games. Since Eric's idea of not playing games is getting the hell out of there and going back to one of their apartments, Shane is more than happy to go along with it.What starts as a scorching-hot one-night stand leaves both of them wanting more until Eric finds out Shane doesn t just outrank him, he's an officer. DADT may be repealed, but an officer getting involved with an enlisted man falls under conduct unbecoming.Still, they can't resist their mutual desire. There's no reason anyone has to find out. But secrets have a way of outing themselves.Warning: Contains two military boys who keep forgetting they're not supposed to be together. Probably because they never have their uniforms on for any length of time.",
