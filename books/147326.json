The last girl, that had his heart, turned love into a four-letter word.  Insert Stella Avery, who Ty meets through his best friend, and hires as a photography assistant. Stella redefines everything. She won’t settle for a one nighter anymore. She dreams of attraction, friendship and ultimately…love.  It doesn’t take long for Stella and Ty to flow right into friendship.
