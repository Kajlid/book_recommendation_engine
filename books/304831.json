  "description": "When a routine trip to the beach turns to tragedy, Julia Fearon's life becomes a heartbreaking search for the truth. When she arrives in Spain with fianc√© Charlie and their toddler Hadyn, Julia is excited at the prospect of meeting his family. But Julia's happiness is short-lived as she becomes increasingly isolated from the strict and deeply religious clan, and lies from her past threaten to destroy her future happiness. Then tragedy strikes and Haydn disappears on a day out at the beach. Whilst the authorities presume him drowned, Julia is tortured by the thought that her child is alive - and has been snatched. Grief-stricken, Julia searches desperately for the truth, whilst Charlie throws himself into his work. Consumed by the fact that they may never know what happened that day, can Julia find the strength to let Haydn go? Or will her faith be rewarded with the truth? Heart wrenching and morally complex, if you love Dorothy Koomson and Jodi Picoult, you'll love Giselle Green.",
