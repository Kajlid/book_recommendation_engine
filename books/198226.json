  "title": "Protected by the Light: A Spiritual Memoir",
  "description": "We are all surrounded by light—if we only choose to let it in.Imagine going through your life believing that you had the same happy upbringing as everyone else, with a loving family and a caring home. Now imagine finding out, in your thirties, that your entire idyllic childhood was a lie—a lie told to you by your own mind to protect you from the horrors you faced every day. Author Debra Roinestad found out just that, after a near death experience in 2005. She had always had a kind of intuition about her life—a small voice that seemed to protect her and keep her as safe as possible—but it wasn’t until that fateful night in the hospital that she truly came to understand the importance of the voice of her spirit guide. In the months—and years—that followed, Debra would suffer violent tremors, during which memories would come back to her in flashes. Flashes of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her family. Flashes of being drugged into submission when her cries were too loud. Flashes of pain—and light.“Conversion disorder” is what Debra learned she had—a term describing what she went through as a young girl, retreating into a safe place in her mind and “forgetting” about all that was truly happening to her, only to have the memories come crashing back later in life. Protected by the Light is Debra’s raw and unvarnished story. Yes, it is her story of pain, but it is also her story of survival, and of finding the light—a light she hopes will one day lead each of us to find peace.",
