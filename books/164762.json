A decision by the clan's Grandmother, however, soon has Pele facing old fears and new doubts about her very nature.  With none of her family or friends (or Ru) able to truly understand what she's going through, she might have to turn to Vul Azan: a man who claims to be her half brother. But even if she can trust him, there's the small matter of the assassin out to take his life...  Return to the World of Ere and the lives of Pele, Ru, Kaiel, Brin, Raiteria and the other characters from Rune Breaker for the start of an all-new adventure. Witness new places, new wondersâ€”and new threats while along for a ride every bit as thrilling as the first series.  The World of Ere: Fantasy like you've never read it before.",
