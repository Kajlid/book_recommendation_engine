  "description": "WHAT MAKES AN “Our rituals, those us habits, the unimportant is what makes an always.” Making an always isn’t like making a cake. A bed in the morning. A decision, good or bad. Jessica Tyner’s sophomore book explores the makings of an always―as a noun, of course. Five has long been an auspicious number in many cultures, from the five sacred mountains of China to the high five in western countries. What Makes an Always is an exploration of five different, yet complementary, aspects of the human experience we all share at various depths and times. “The Animals of My Father” delves into the first relationship we all Those with our parents, a natural and wild time where many of our quirks, eccentricities, loves and fears solidify. In “The Heft of Lightness,” the examination of the body is laid out spread eagle and naked from the love/hate relationship with food to the awakening from eating disorders. “Recollection of the Training Days” is a reflection of the early years of romantic love, those ugly cry days and elations so striking you’re certain nobody, but nobody, has ever felt the same. “What Makes an Always” is what happens when love settles in that good, sweet way. Finally, “Lovely in the Strange” is a shift from ruminating on the past and risking a look forward. Our experiences are all different in their subtleties and nuances, yet a like connection holds strong. It’s that connection we all share that’s the secret recipe. That’s what makes an always.
