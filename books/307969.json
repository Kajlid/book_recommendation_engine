  "description": "It is dawn. One man stands upon a ladder, putting the final touches on his greatest work, smiling at the addition of a woman, huddled in a red cloak. With a flourish, he makes the last stroke of his brush and steps down to admire his masterpiece. The character he added draws the eye into the world of trees and hills. It is perfect and he knows his career is made.He glances around but the woman who inspired perfection isn't there. Only a folded red cloak rests on the rock where she sat earlier. Picking up the cold fabric, the artist sighs. He must find her because he knows his life, and his creativity, will never be complete without the mysterious woman's presence. But first, he must meet a duke and receive his reward for achieving the impossible.The Artist and His Muse is one of The Wordmage's Tales, accompanying The Apprentice Storyteller. The apprentice has learned from master storyteller, Viola Alerion, and now he performs these classic tales from the Haldrian Empire in his own right.",
