  "title": "Writing a Novel: Bring Your Ideas To Life The Faber Academy Way",
  "description": "Writing A Novel is not a set of rules and regulations. It is an atlas, a guide to finding your own way over the treacherous passes of your first novel.Pulling together his years of experience as a novelist and a teacher, Richard Skinner covers the basics of writing great fiction – narrators, characters, settings – with charm and rigour. But more than that, he argues that the journey towards a final manuscript is as important as the finished article itself.His approach works: many of Richard's students have gone on to secure publishing deals and many more have left his courses with work to be proud of. With its balance of warmth and wisdom, Writing a Novel will give any aspiring writer the confidence to face the blank page – and to fill it.",
