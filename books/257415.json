  "description": "A powerful contemporary romance set in the fast-moving world of international modelling. \"What’s it like dating one of the most beautiful men in the world? A man whose face is on every magazine and ad campaign? Not as much fun as it sounds, as Anna Scott is about to find out. Retired from rugby at the age of 33, injured and bored, Nick is given the chance to enter the high stakes world of fashion photography as a model. But behind the glittering façade lies an ugly drugs, alcohol, all the deadly sins, and people willing to sleep their way to the top. It’s a tough life and tougher on relationships. Nick needs to learn to navigate the treacherous path quickly or risk losing it all—including the woman who has become his reason for living. In this glamorous world, there is no room for error. Being a MODEL BOYFRIEND has never been harder. Can nice guy Nick find his way through, or will he be tempted to risk it all? Because the one thing he despises is failure. He’s a lot more than a pretty face.\" This story continues where UNDEFEATED left off, although it can also be read as a stand-alone story in its own right.",
