  "description": "Find love, mystery and adventure in WHEN SHADOWS FALL, the seventh book in Barbara Freethy's New York Times Bestselling Series, The Callaways. Olivia Bennett is a biographer, a narrator of lives far more interesting than her own. Orphaned as a child, she has always been fascinated by family relationships. When she volunteers to write down the memories of Eleanor Callaway, an elderly woman suffering from Alzheimer's, she gets caught up in a compelling story of a great love and a terrible secret. Suddenly, she is no longer a spectator but an investigator, and in her quest for truth, she finds herself at odds with Eleanor's sexy and very protective grandson, Colton Callaway. Colton is a firefighter, a man used to going after what he wants and getting it. He pushes the limits, takes chances, and is willing to risk everything to save a life,especially if that life belongs to his grandmother. As Olivia and Colton stir up the smoldering embers of the past, they soon come to realize that the greatest danger may not come from those who want to protect their secrets but from each other. Because the one thing neither has ever been willing to risk is their heart.",
