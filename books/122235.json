  "description": "Truth or Dare: Tell the One-Who-Got-Away that you're still madly in love with him OR spend the night trapped with him in a hunting lodge that's about to be swept downstream?Ha! Trick Question. I get to do BOTH! Because when it rains, it pours.First, I call Theo McGuire to tell him that I've always loved him and I always will--at least for the next few hours until Pippa Jane the Pig and I are swallowed by the floodwaters. Then, I open the second story window when Theo comes knocking in his kayak, in a likely doomed attempt to save us.Soon, we're trapped in the cabin where we had our first time fifteen years ago and all I can think about is how much I wish I could turn back the clock. If I could, I'd never let this fiercely kind and sexy-as-hell man go.Since this could be The End, we agree to make our last night a night to remember.But what happens when morning dawns, we're both still breathing, and I can't bear to think of a life without my favorite McGuire?",
