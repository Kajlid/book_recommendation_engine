  "description": "My neighbor is a Grinch.Since I run the Christmas Emporium and sometimes moonlight as an elf, that's kind of a problem for me.No surprise, though. When I brought over cookies to welcome him to the neighborhood this summer, he slammed the door in my face.Until he brings his kid to visit Santa one of the days I'm working as an elf, and I realize there are key parts of their story I'm missing ...1. The little girl is his much younger sister, not his daughter.2. He's her guardian since their parents died in a tragic accident.Now all of his handsome, broody glares make so much more sense. As one of Santa's elves, I make it my mission to make this Christmas as special for them as possible. Which somehow includes trespassing on his property to hang Christmas lights and braiding the little girl's hair regularly.Despite his glares and grumpiness, I discover the soft underbelly of the beast. Will this Grinch's heart grow three sizes as well? And if it does, will it have room for me?A Very Grumpy Christmas is a standalone, small town, neighbors to lovers romance featuring a grumpy single dad and the sunshiny neighbor who's determined to make his Christmas better. Full of heat and heart with an HEA guaranteed!",
