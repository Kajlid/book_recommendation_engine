  "title": "You Come to Yokum",
  "description": "In the winter of 1920, everything changed. Frank and his family got a Model T and drove to the Berkshires to try to make a success of a vacation/hunting lodge at Yokum Pond. There are fun adventures and incidents with invited guests and uninvited animal visitors, including the mysterious “horrible huge.” The rural setting and less-than-receptive neighbors fail to deter Frank’s mother from pursuing her fight for suffrage, much to the consternation of her husband and a number of the lodge’s guests, but in the end, she sees Tennessee ratify the amendment and earns a place of reverence in the movement.",
