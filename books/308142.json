  "description": "A Mem-Noir: Inspired by True Events From Brent Spiner, who played the beloved Lieutenant Commander Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation, comes this hilarious autobiographical novel, a personal look at the slightly askew relationship between a celebrity and his fans. If the Coen brothers were to make a Star Trek movie about the complexity of fan obsession and sci-fi, this dark comedy might be the result. In 1991, just as Star Trek: The Next Generation has rocketed the cast to global fame, the young and impressionable Brent Spiner receives a mysterious package and a series of disturbing letters, sending him on a terrifying and bizarre journey. Paramount Security, the LAPD, and even the FBI were eventually involved in ending the danger that has his life and career hanging in the balance.Fan Fiction is a zany love letter to a world in which we all participate, the phenomenon of \"Fandom.\"",
