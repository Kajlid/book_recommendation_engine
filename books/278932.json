  "title": "Charlie's War",
  "description": "When a plane crash leaves Charlie Bassett rested from the RAF, he receives unexpected orders—to locate the elusive, pregnant Grace Baker and bring her home. But Grace, who has been following the armed forces across Europe, clearly does not want to be found, and despite Charlie's personal stake in it, this bizarre and challenging mission is still one he would rather avoid. Nevertheless, Charlie finds himself journeying to France in a car named Kate, with a dubious, eccentric Army Major and his loyal Sergeant—two men who are evidently going about mysterious duties of their own. As Charlie moves slowly towards the frontline on this exhilarating road trip, so too does he draw closer to the woman he once loved and lost.",
