  "description": "On the day Crown Princess Chandrea Averill is born, her kingdom is attacked and her parents are brutally assassinated. To save her life and allow her to grow to maturity, several spells are cast upon the tiny newborn princess, and she is sent through a magical portal to Earth. There, she lives in secrecy until her 23rd birthday, oblivious to her true origins—or the powers laying dormant within her.  Without warning, the spell reverses itself, and Chandrea suddenly finds herself in a dark cave beneath the decimated ruins of her ancestral home. Confronted with the reality of her birth world and her true heritage, surrounded by strange magical creatures, dangerous sorcery, and treacherous political intrigue, Chandrea is overwhelmed and desperately wants to return home. But, the longer she stays, the more she realizes that she may be the only one with the power—both political and magical—to help the people of Lyrunia escape the tyrannical rule of Leilah, the Queen of Svara. Will she be willing to give up the only life she’s ever known and remain in this alien land to fight for the people she was born to save? And, if she stays, will she ever be able to go home again?",
