  "description": "The NoblesWe come from high society, but the grooming process starts in high school.And we always recruit in the dark.As a result, our messes are rarely clean and never brought to light.Money's not an issue, and usually, neither are our members.Until one decides to betray us.Let this be a lesson to our initiates: Never choose love over loyalty.And a word to Chase Stone, Briarcliff’s most sought-after student—if you tell the new girl we exist, it won't just be you that pays the price.Me, the New GirlWell, crap.\nRIVAL is the first full-length novel in the Briarcliff Society Series and contains enemies-to-lovers, bullying, and other mature themes (but is not a dark romance). Recommended for readers 17 and over. It is NOT a standalone and ends on a cliffhanger with a happy-for-now (but a happily ever after will happen … in the end.)",
