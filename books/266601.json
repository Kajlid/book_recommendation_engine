  "description": "Introduction, by editor:In a world that has almost forgotten how to laugh, and actually has so deplorably little reason to laugh, this, too, seems of importance. And the editor verily believes that a Christmas anthology such as the present one, bringing together for the first time not merely the cream of the crop of humorous Christmas stories penned by some of the world's greatest writers, but also s selection of the best Christmas drawings, cartoons and illustrations by the finest artists of the last half century, is a worthy undertaking.",
