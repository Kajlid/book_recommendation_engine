  "description": "For decades, people believed the world would change in a flash of light.  We were right. But it wasn't a nuclear weapon. On a day in late November in the year 2000, the flash happened. A surge of incredible power annihilated a small town and announced the arrival of a new breed. One man was enough to change everything, but he was not alone.  He was only the first.  More than a decade later, the Next are everywhere. They are registered, cataloged, and forced to wear identification. Even under the burden of suspicion and fear, most of them live normal lives. Others serve their communities as police or firefighters, the closest thing to heroes they are allowed to be.  Some are criminals.  It is this group Kitra Singh will face when she is pulled from her comfortable existence as a government agent and thrust into the limelight as a member of the OSA, an organization that captures and contains superhuman criminals. The stakes are high: a killer is on the loose, hunting human and Next alike. Time is short, the danger growing, and hundreds of lives are at risk.  In a race against the clock, Kit will be tested as never before. She will stand toe to toe with god-like beings, and be forced to discover how far she is willing to go to stop them.",
