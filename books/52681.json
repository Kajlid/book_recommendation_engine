  "description": "As a trained royal consort, Prince Aiden thought he was prepared for anything. He was wrong.Aiden wasn't prepared for Wolf Prince Lanthe, a callous shifter with wolfish yellow eyes and a disdain for humans. He wasn't prepared to be publicly claimed as the prince's mate on their first meeting. And he certainly wasn't prepared to bear Lanthe's pups. Much too late, Aiden learns this isn't a political marriage, it's a breeding contract. He must submit to his monstrous new mate if he wants to keep his kingdom safe.Lanthe despises humans almost as much as the magical heat that compels him to breed. He's determined to keep his new human mate out of sight and away from the throne, but Aiden refuses to be relegated to the shadows as a powerless breed-mate. He is a prince, and he intends to secure power by whatever means necessary.",
