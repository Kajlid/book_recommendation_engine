  "description": "Elara Rivers is broken. With each whispered threat and hidden abuse, she shatters just a little bit more. Breaking the heart of Kadence Falls University's resident heartthrob has made her public enemy number one. Too bad nobody seems to care that he was breaking her, in more ways than one. She seeks refuge at Kadence Falls. A place of myth and wonder. A place which filled her father's bedtime stories. The stories of far off worlds shrouded by moonlight always thrilled her. But Elara is about to learn that sometimes stories are more than legend. Life isn't as it seems, because one thing her father always told her remains true. Water never lies.",
