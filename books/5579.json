  "title": "Postscript to the Name of the Rose",
  "description": "This book stems from Umberto Eco's account of the genesis of his extraordinary novel, The Name of the Rose, but, like the novel itself, it goes far beyond the particular: '...in March 1978 ... I had the urge to poison a monk.' Along the way, it touches on bad books, ideal readers, historical form, and the metaphysics of the detective story.",
