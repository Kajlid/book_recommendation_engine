  "description": "Separus, the mighty demon wants Aurora on his side. He wants her to come willingly, or he will take her hostage until she succumbs to his leadership. In his plot to capture her, he disappears, and Archangel Michael must find him. To do this, he must forsake his training regime with his gifted fledglings, Aurora, Ben and Cindy. The continuation of their training is vital and the only angel with the skills available is Zacharias. He has turned his back on the Archangels yet offhandedly he continues to serve while based at Tatev Monastery. His training is not for the light-hearted. The method he uses makes Archangel Michael’s strict methods seem soft. During training, the word has reached them that Separus is after Aurora. To draw her out of her training in the Tatev Monastery, he is going after the human Ethan, Aurora’s past lives true love. Much to Ben’s discomfort, the battle is on to protect him. Will Aurora succeed in protecting Ethan before it is too late or will she have to sever her angelic relationships and bow to Separus’ leadership?",
