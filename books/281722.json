  "description": "Shawn O’Callaghan loves his job as a screenwriter almost as much as he loves his family. But this latest project could quite possibly test his patience beyond anything he’s ever had to endure. Generally unflappable, the author he’s thrown into the trenches with pushes every button he has. Sometimes twice. And it doesn’t help that he can’t stop thinking about her in ways that are anything but professional. But how can he help it? The redhead is gorgeous beyond reason—and utterly infuriating.Bestselling author Lexi Perry is finally about to leave her mark on the world; after all, seeing her dark and dangerous words brought to life is a dream come true. Until she meets the man who is supposed to make that happen. From the minute they laid eyes on each other, it was clear there would be tension, but she had no idea how much until they got down to business. He obviously doesn’t understand her vision. Though she’s having trouble lately too, given all she can picture is what he looks like under his clothes and imagining what it would sound like if he talked dirty to her in that sexy Irish lilt of his.If they can find a way to meet in the middle, this movie could be one for the ages. As could their love.",
