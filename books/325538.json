As she stares at it, she's grabbed from behind. Her attacker is Anders, a boy who used to be at her school. Pocketing the phone, he swears her to silence and vanishes.When Flora finally discovers where he's gone, she meets a group of rebels. A meeting that changes her life - and everything she thought she knew - for ever.\"A lone girl's search for truth in a world of violence and lies. I read Flora's story with my heart in my mouth.\" Kat Armstrong, author of \"A Pair of Sharp Eyes.\"",
