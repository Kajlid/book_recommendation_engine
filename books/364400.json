  "title": "Under the Ivy: The Life & Music of Kate Bush",
  "description": "This is the first ever in-depth study of Kate Bush's life and career. \"Under the Ivy\" features over 70 unique and revealing new interviews with those who have viewed from up close both the public artist and the private old school friends, early band mates, long-term studio collaborators, former managers, producers, musicians, video directors, dance instructors and record company executives. \"Under the Ivy\" undertakes a full analysis of Bush's art. From her pre-teen forays into poetry, through scores of unreleased songs. Every crucial aspect of her music is discussed from her ground-breaking series of albums to her solo live tour. Her pioneering forays into dance, video, film and performance. Combining a wealth of new research with rigorous critical scrutiny, \"Under the Ivy\" offers a string of fresh insights and perspectives on her unusual upbringing in South London, the blossoming of her talent, her enduring influences and unique working methods, her rejection of live performance, her pioneering use of the studio, her key relationships and her gradual retreat into a semi-mythical privacy.",
