  "description": "Chief of Police Andrea Taylor wasn't even supposed to be at work the night she mowed down handsome stranger Dash Fletcher during a police chase. Now she's got an injured circus performer on her hands who might or might not be the guy she's been waiting for all her life. But since her last romance ended with her pumping a bullet into her boyfriend, she's a little gun shy. Plus, she's got a murder to solve, a murder that might be tied to the handsome stranger with the broken leg her aunt has moved into the family home. With her career in jeopardy and her heart on the line, her whole life is turning into a three-ring circus.",
