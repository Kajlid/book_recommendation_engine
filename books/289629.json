  "description": "\"'No witnesses, no problems.' Thompson's mantra was supposed to be reassuring to the smaller man, but Percy felt the shadow of his own death coming. There was one witness. Him. And he cowered, wondering when his neck would be broken, when his body would be ripped apart with bullets.\"Maybe the youngest son of a violent criminal named Hoggy Thompson was born a beast. Maybe rage was beaten into him.One thing was certain,  by the time he reached manhood, Jerry Thompson was a savage killer. He had no conscience about rape, child molestation, or thrashing a dozen men in a prison fight. Once he got his hands on a gun, any target would do. He didn't leave witnesses.When he terrorized an entire courtroom and offered to rip deputy prosecutor Larry Sells apart, people wondered if there would ever be a way to stop his viciousness.Now from the authors of bestselling true crime, RACE TO JUSTICE,  comes an even more frightening story of a monster and what it took to defeat him once and for all.",
