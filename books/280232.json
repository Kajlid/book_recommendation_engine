  "description": "It's Sunday morning, very early Sunday morning. Anthony and Nicholas are not supposed to wake their parents before 9:45 am. (Whenever that is.) Certainly, three puzzles falling off a shelf isn't enough to wake them. And what about some music or a game of boat in the living room? These wouldn't wake them up, would they? But when Nick really yells help, the know they're in trouble. Then the boys and their parents discover something they never would have imagined.",
