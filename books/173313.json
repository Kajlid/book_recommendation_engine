  "description": "Nola Lantry is a tracist: she can sense the particles of energy that are released when the human body expires.It’s a somewhat gruesome ability, and one of questionable value, but Nola tries her best to use it to bring a little more meaning and excitement to her otherwise drab life in upstate New York. She has assisted the Redfort Police Department on missing persons cases, and while most of the cops have little respect for her work, Nola is determined to prove her worth.The chance to do just that comes when the richest man in town, Culver Bryant, disappears.Suddenly Nola finds herself in the middle of a case that is both baffling and increasingly dangerous, the danger appearing in the form of death threats as well as the missing man’s brother, Grayson. Does Grayson Bryant pursue Nola to seduce her or to stop her—and why does Nola feel a connection with him despite her mistrust?",
