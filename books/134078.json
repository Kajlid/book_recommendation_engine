  "title": "Discover Early Music",
  "description": "The Middle Ages began with the collapse of the Roman world. This left a military and political system in ruins but a cultural world-view largely intact. Artistically rich and varied in themselves, the medieval centuries also sparked both the artistic Renaissance and the religious Reformation that followed. Rich but musically lost? Buildings and statues endure, but how can we ever really know about early music and what the Medieval and Renaissance world sounded like? From the evidence that remains, modern performers have embarked on the great adventure of rediscovering, recreating and reinventing some of the earliest surviving music of Europe with prolific and fascinating results. Visually, mentally and aurally engaging, this new and accessible Discover series from Naxos Books opens the door to key areas of classical music. This book is peppered with quotations, pictures and helpful tips on what to listen for. A dedicated website includes 2Â½ hours of carefully chosen music extracts. An ideal musical introductions for readers of all ages.",
