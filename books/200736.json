  "title": "Gunflame - Tales of the Old West",
  "description": "This collection of tales is not about the legends of our country's frontier. It is about the lives of ordinary people and their experiences merely surviving in the days of the old west. Brimming with outlaws, miners, cowboys, Indians, railroad barons, cattle barons and more, many ordinary people did extraordinary things in order to survive. This collection of short stories narrates those lives. These characters of the Old West come alive in these dazzling pages of mountains, deserts and high country, capturing the imagination and inspiring exploration.",
