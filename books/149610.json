  "description": "Balkaran Singh Sidhu likes to portray the constant inner struggle of a transpersonal being. He often finds himself in the same battle of which he speaks of. Through free verse poetry, which he regards as a personal ritual, he seeks out a spiritual harmony between the body and the soul. Sidhu was born in Punjab and grew up in a little village where he acquired the perennial values of Punjabi culture. He dwells within his metaphors but was spotted in Delhi while he published his first self-anthology.",
