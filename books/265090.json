  "description": "If there’s one thing I hate, it’s being tied up. Being a spy is great, most of the time. I get to go under cover and be around all kinds of sexy guys. It’s the perfect job. I’m smart and creative. Sometimes, very creative. Personal attributes are a girl’s best friend and I’m a very popular girl. Yeah, I can get a little carried away. HQ criticise my methods, but I don’t care. I always get what I want. I knew straight away my manager was the one to watch. Bulging muscles, dark eyes and an attitude that sucks. How could I resist hitching up my skirt higher? Now I’m the one tied up naked, doing things I shouldn’t be doing! Vulnerable and needy. Powerless to resist. It feels so good! I must escape. I need to alert HQ. But there’s fire in my body that needs to be quenched and the door is opening… Book 1 of the Spies series.",
