  "description": "\"There are no other demons like me.\"  Restaurant owner, Hollywood socialite, Prince of Pride: Li'el is one of few demons left this side of the veil, and he has every intention of reveling in his new-found freedom.  But being the last demon in LA means that when mauled and shredded bodies are found within a few blocks of Li'el's popular Decadent-i restaurant, the list of suspects is a short one.  Add to that the suspicious death of a well-known reporter during one of Li'el's infamous after-parties, and he soon finds himself wanted for all the wrong reasons.  With the Dark Court gone and his powers waning, his reign at the top of the demon food chain could be over.  The Prince of Pride is about to discover there are worse creatures than demons in LA...  The demons are back in Chaos Falls, the third and final installment in the Chaos Rises series.",
