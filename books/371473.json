  "title": "The Witch People: The Legend of the Mosses",
  "description": "The year is 1397 and Linnea just lost everything. Exactly everything! The accusations of witchcraft force her to flee into the woods even though nothing scares her more than the forest. She has heard about everything that exists there. Sirens, ghosts and the Moss family — the most feared witch family of them all. The Mosses — the ones who trick people into their dark abodes. Real witches, not innocent peasant women. Alone and hungry, she is only hours away from freezing to death when a strange man approaches her. He is very beautiful and terrifying at the same time. Linnea feels strangely attracted to him. He claims he can help her, but does she dare to go with him?",
