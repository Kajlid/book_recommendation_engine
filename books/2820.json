  "description": "In 1958, three men narrowly escape the Litang monastery after the fatal attack of the Chinese. Running through the Himalayas to Lhasa - the Forbidden City where not one Westerner had been allowed to enter until 1951 - the men find refuge and are asked by the Tibetan Resistance to travel to America as part of a top-secret, CIA mission called ST Circus. Agreeing to join the CIa's mission, the three men - one young monk and two brothers - are transported to a camp at the top of the Rockies, just above the town of Leadville, Colorado.1958 Leadville may have looked the same from the mountain tops as the sight was chosen for its similar terrain to the Himalayas, but the culture was much different; and to the folks from Leadville, the Tibetans were different, too. Having just doubled its population from 2,000, in 1950, to 4,000, by 1958, Leadville's baby boom - and all that went along with it - was in full swing.Leadville 300 Days Away is a love story. It is a about people - what draws us together, what pulls us apart. It is about the meaning of home. A story of courage, survival, heart, and soul; it is written with love. Love for Tibet and its people; and love for all the people who have cared - right or wrong - to try enough to do something by shedding light and spreading love.Leadville 300 Days Away is a historical fiction novel that reads, sometimes, like a non-fiction because of richness in information and facts about the lives of the characters, the ordeals of the Tibetan Resistance, and those involved in the ST Circus operation. It is a story to be engrossed in, full of the fondness of our human 'selves', our imperfections, and our strengths. It tells a story about the amazing power of Tibetans to love their homeland and to have survived such struggle.",
