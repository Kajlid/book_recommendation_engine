  "description": "What does it take to break down a society? Running out of a resource is a good way to start. Far in the future, a barren, rocky planet called Bristalar flourishes on a natural acidic substance called brist that, when neutralized, can be consumed as a replacement for water. Due to the uninhabitable nature of the planet surface, all citizens live in hollowed mountains left behind by the acid. The poorest of the poor live off acidic \"pools\", using black market powders to neutralize the acid and cling to life. They are the first victims when the brist runs out. Ten years previously, the family of eighteen year old Kendra Kettle was torn apart by a family argument. When the brist begins to dwindle, her and her two brothers are caught in the middle of the sudden conflict and desperation and must navigate their changing world and survive at all costs. Even if it means fighting against each other.",
