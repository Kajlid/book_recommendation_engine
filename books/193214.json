  "description": "Special Agent Leo Gale is up a creek. A year and a half of deep cover is about to go up in flames. He needs help--something, someone to salvage the operation and save the lives of untold numbers of trafficked teenagers. But he isn’t expecting the partner they send, or his own gut-punch of a response to the man.Julian worked hard for that FBI Honors Internship. It’s supposed to be a foot in the door. He’d never expected it to catapult him into the middle of a major undercover operation. Yet here he is, sleeping on a filthy mattress and using every trick in the book to avoid torture--and worse. He’s never felt so scared, or so alive, in his entire life, and he’s not sure if it’s the danger, or Leo, that’s making his heart race.There’s no time to think about it, though. The operation is heating up, and Leo and Julian are running out of time and options. They must find a way to take the traffickers down, before Julian becomes just a set of organs on the flesh market.",
