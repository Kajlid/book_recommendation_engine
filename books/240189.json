Now, Janie is fed up and ready to call it quits, but he wants to hold on. As secrets are revealed, Janie realizes her husband’s double life may just cost her own. The last thing Malcolm thought he’d be doing during his vacation was harboring Janie to keep her alive.

Can he keep his distance long enough to figure who’s after her?",
