The participants in this violent challenge are rumored to be GhostWalkers. And Kaden Montague isn’t happy about it.   Kaden is a GhostWalker and he’s determined to clear the GhostWalker name of the rumors. And he’s going to need the help of psychic Tansy Meadows to do it. But as soon as he sees her, he knows his mission will be more complicated than he imagined—and the “murder game” may not be at all what it seems.",
