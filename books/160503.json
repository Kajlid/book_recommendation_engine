  "description": "William Ury, coauthor of the classic bestseller on negotiation Getting to Yes, has taught tens of thousands of people from all walks of life—managers, salespeople, students, parents, lawyers, and diplomats—how to become better negotiators. Over the years, Ury has discovered that the greatest obstacle to successful agreements and satisfying relationships is not the other side, as difficult as they can be. The biggest obstacle is actually ourselves—our natural tendency to react in ways that do not serve our true interests.But this obstacle can also become our biggest opportunity, Ury argues. If we learn to understand and influence ourselves first, we lay the groundwork for understanding and influencing others.In this indispensable prequel to Getting to Yes, Ury draws deeply on his personal and professional experience negotiating conflicts around the world to present a practical method to help you get to yes with yourself first, dra-matically improving your ability to get to yes with others.Extraordinarily useful and elegantly simple, Getting to Yes with Yourself is an essential guide to achieving the inner satisfaction that will, in turn, make your life better, your relationships healthier, your family happier, your work more productive, and the world around you more peaceful.",
