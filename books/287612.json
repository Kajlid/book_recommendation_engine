  "description": "Six years after the Rise, Australia’s coastal towns are gone, lost under the ocean’s unstoppable advance. The survivors have retreated to a series of newly formed islands off the coast of New South Wales, seeking to rebuild their lives with limited resources, destructive weather, and fierce competition amongst communities.And not all are successful . . .Baz is a fresh water merchant, desalinating saltwater and bartering this valuable commodity throughout the struggling island communities. But his real mission is something closer to his heart, the one thing that has plagued him since the catastrophic rise in water levels: he must find his daughter and grandchildren.While the rest of the country fights to stay alive, all Baz cares about is reuniting with the only family he has left. His greatest fear is that he’s already too late.",
