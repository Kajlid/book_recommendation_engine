  "description": "\"Would you like to be a Hero?\" It's what many dream of, and what one young girl is offered when she is woken by a mysterious stranger with a television for a head. In the middle of the night, she is whisked away into a world of fantastical metaphor, where emotions take physical form and the inanimate comes alive. Surrounded by a cast of whimsical characters and unnamed dangers, and guided by the stranger RGB, who has terrifying secrets of his own, she must find it within herself to choose her own path amid the destiny that has been chosen for her.
