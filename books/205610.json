  "description": "* The Henchmen return to finally give us Wolf & Janie’s story. *  He was just supposed to be saving her from herself… and the half dozen criminal enterprises that would want her blood when they realized what she had done.  What he hadn’t planned on was her invading every aspect of his life with her fiery temper and inability to take no for an answer. And when he finally got beneath her walls and found out why she had gotten herself into trouble in the first place, he knew what he needed to do.  He sure as hell didn’t think he would end up being the one who would need saving…   * This can be read as a stand-alone and has a HEA, but features characters from The Henchmen and Savages series.  ** This is a DARK read.
