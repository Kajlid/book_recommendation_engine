  "description": "Discover the answer to the mysteries of these debilitating illnesses Explaining \"Unexplained Illnesses\" provides long-sought explanations for the properties of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), fibromyalgia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. This groundbreaking book examines common symptoms and signs; short-term stressors such as infection, chemical exposure, physical trauma, and severe psychological stress; why people are often diagnosed as having more than one of these illnesses, and approaches for treating the cause of each disease, rather than the symptoms. The book presents a detailed and well-supported mechanism (the NO/ONOO- cycle) that provides consistent explanations for many of the puzzling elements of these diseases.At least a dozen scientists have proposed that chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivity, and fibromyalgia must share a common mechanism; others have suggested posttraumatic stress disorder may belong to this group as well. This unique book provides explanations for their previously unexplained properties with more than 1,500 references to scientific literature, creating a whole new approach to therapy and treatment of these illnesses. Explaining \"Unexplained Illnesses\" provides answers to these questions: how do short-term stressors initiate chronic illness?how does the biochemistry of the NO/ONOO- cycle produce chronic illness?how can the diverse symptoms and signs of these illnesses be generated as a consequence of their common biochemistry?why is there so much variation in symptoms from one sufferer to another?what are the principles underlying the NO/ONOO- cycle mechanism?how does the NO/ONOO- cycle provide explanations for a dozen previously unexplained properties of these illnesses?how might 14 additional illnesses/diseases also be caused by the NO/ONOO- cycle etiology?and many moreExplaining \"Unexplained Illnesses\" is a must-read for physicians and scientists, and for anyone who suffers from-or knows someone who suffers from--these previously puzzling illnesses.",
