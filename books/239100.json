  "title": "The Innkeeper",
  "description": "I am the Innkeeper, and my stories are both true and unique. Thumb through the pages. You will find over a hundred images to accompany some teenage exploits, a stint as an Air Force bomber pilot, some romantic encounters, a dive for treasure off a ship that sank in 1862, and 43 years as owner and Innkeeper of a small, seaside inn on a tropical beach in Mexico.Manzanillo, in the tiny state of Colima, is the major setting for these adventures, and you will take away a singular view of the Mexican people you won’t find in papers and magazines. Intermix Spaniards with Indians and the result is quite something. You’ll see.Innkeeper is a journey. Along the way you will meet Ken Kesey, Bing Crosby, Lee Marvin, Lyndon Johnson’s brother (I didn’t know he had one, either), Jack Ruby and many others. I expound a few times about things better presented by wiser persons, but that’s part of the fun in my book. My wife is German and calls me Herr Besserwisser which translates into Mr. Know-it-all. I can explain that.Other than Mexico, you’ll spend time with me in North Africa, Spain, France, Italy, Iceland, Costa Rica, and underwater off the coast of Guam. And there will be sea snakes, alligators, sharks and their human equivalents to hold your attention.Enjoy my tale.",
