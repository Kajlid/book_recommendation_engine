  "description": "He murdered her sister – and now she’s planning on marrying him? Bethany Petersen is the rightful heir to the Petersen Estate, but her grandmother’s will states otherwise. Instead, it will go to Walker Keane, the murderer of her sister. The only way she can get control of the estate is through marriage to Walker. The idea is absurd to Bethany, and she assumes he will think so, too. Instead of trying to help her find a way around her grandmother’s stipulation, he asks her to marry him. So she hatches a plan to not only to get her inheritance back, but once and for all prove that her sister was murdered by Walker. She agrees to his deal. Marriage, even if it is in name only, and then after one year, they will split the inheritance. The ruse of marriage will give her access to the information she needs to prove his guilt. However, Bethany quickly finds out her plan isn’t as simple as she thought. As the truth begins to unfold, so do her feelings for Walker. Will buried secrets reveal his innocence, or confirm her suspicions that she’s gotten herself into a deadly arrangement?",
