  "description": "Shelly's Revenge is the name of the Game!  Shelly Stavins is divorced, bitter and vindictive. One bright sunny Friday morning, her attorney husband of ten years pecks her on the cheek, pats her son on the head and leaves for his office. Or so she thinks. Before noon, she answers her door to a smug, navy suit, red tie wearing process server who hands over her official divorce papers. The promised settlement is one no woman in her right mind could refuse. Why fight? Why bother?  Tired of all the speculation and gossip of the husbands' wives' club and bored with a life that no longer resembles the fantasy life style she had grown accustomed to, Shelly opts to move on. Settling in for the long haul, she invests the profit from the sale of her house into a local business and newly built property on the outskirts of Chandlerville, Kentucky.  Running a quaint but charming book store and being a full time single mother does little to soften her heart. But a softened heart is not her goal because 'Shelly's Revenge' is the name of the game.  Player #1: Handsome bestselling author Justin Raye, Chandlerville's author in residence for the summer. Should she consider her childhood heart throb's 'marriage for the kids sake' proposal?  Player #2: Local cop, Carlos Nunes, Chandlerville's hero, the Mayor's best friend and Shelly's obnoxious unofficial body guard. Shelly detests him and his white knight in shining armor come on or does she?  Player #3: A woman with a broken heart.  Winner takes all.",
