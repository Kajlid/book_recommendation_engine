  "description": "Edited by Pamela Gordon, Denis Harold and Bill Manhire. \"The Goose Bath: Poems\" is a whimsical yet skillfully crafted collection of poetry that will cleave open your imagination, letting all its splendor spill out. \"Janet Frame used to keep geese, using the base of an old garden fountain as their bath. In later years the geese went but the bath was brought indoors as a receptable into which Janet piled her jottings as she reworked and developed her poems. Over time the bath overflowed with paper, including hundreds of unpublished poems. By the time Janet died she had named her hoped-for but elusive new selection The Goose Bath.\" -- Waitakere City Libraries summary",
