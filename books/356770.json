  "title": "False Dawn",
  "description": "It is the turn of the twenty-first century. War, disease, and pollution have made the Earth nearly unfit for human habitation. In America, food is scarce, and what food remains is quickly confiscated by the Pirates—a murderous band of raiders determined to save themselves and to destroy the last stronghold of civilized human beings—the mutant population.One of these mutants, a woman named Thea, has eluded the Pirates for years. Armed only with a crossbow, her pride, and her common sense, she has been slowly making her way Eastward to Gold Lake—a legendary place of safety and enlightenment. Until one day she meets Evan Montague, a man who needs her help, a man who is also on the run from the Pirates, but for a different reason—he once led the Pirates himself and has now become their most bitter and most hunted enemy.Together, Thea and Evan trek across a dangerous and wasted California, hoping to survive the brutality of twenty-first-century life…and, perhaps, to find Eden before they die.",
