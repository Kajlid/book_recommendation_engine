  "description": "“Delicate and resilient. Like you.”Brina and Eagan meet for the first time when she's nine and he's fourteen. They like each other from the very beginning, though their bond isn't immediate, but it grows over the years. What links them is the fact that their parents are photographers and are extremely devoted to their work and to each other; so much so that both Brina and Eagan have to learn how to take care of themselves from a very young age. Despite their differences, age, gender, nationality - Brina is Italian and Eagan is American - they find comfort in their growing friendship. Then Brina becomes a teenager, and her feelings for her friend start changing and deepening. New desires stir within her. As soon as Brina realizes how those feelings complicate her friendship with Eagan, she runs away from him. A few years later, Brina is twenty and Eagan is twenty-five, they find one another once again.(Recommended for ages 18+, due to sexual content and language).Publisher's note: This is a fully re-edited and enriched with new and special contents version of the previously published novel, A Veil of Glass and Rain, by Petra F. Bagnardi (aka Petra March). Praise for “A Veil of Glass and Rain”:Indie Book of the Day Award Winner, October 2nd 2014.\"A Veil of Glass and Rain is a beautifully written, emotionally evocative book that I definitely recommend. The author is, I believe, European, and most of the book takes place in Rome, and the novel had a very European flavor to it that I found refreshing and different from my usual read. It’s hard to describe exactly what I mean, but it reminded me of other French and Italian novels I’ve read—there was a relaxed sensuality to the writing, not only in the love scenes (though those were definitely sensual!) but in the descriptions of scenery, food, emotions, and more.\" (Stephanie Parent, author of \"Precious Things\") “The writing tied everything together, it felt like reading poetry. It's definitely a style that I don't think I've ever read before.“ (Jackie's Book World) “A Veil of Glass and Rain is such a poetic and heart wrenching story about two best friends who fall in love and who have had to overcome obstacles in order to get to where they are. It is written in such a poetic and vibrant way that I was immediately drawn into the story of Brina and Eagan. I absolutely loved that it took place mostly in Rome, Italy, one of my most favorite places in the world and one of the most beautiful cities I have ever had the privilege of visiting.“ (Turning Pages Blog) “You will find yourself entranced with the wonderful words describing the many cities this story lives within. With each description your mind creates a visual that seems real enough to touch. You will feel the growing pains of each character. The hurt that will have your eyes fill with tears, the anger that will have your body tighten in defense, the self-loathing and self-doubt will tie your heart in knots while the intense feelings of love with melt all of your senses. “ (Debbie Kagan - Literati Literature Lovers/Literati Book Reviews ) “I really enjoyed this story and read it in one day as I could not put it down. It leaves you with a nice feeling and you keep thinking about it long after you’ve finished.” (Sharon's Book Nook)",
