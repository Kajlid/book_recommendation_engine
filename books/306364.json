  "description": "How to Write Poetry: A Tutorial, Book 1: Beginning, is especially useful for children grades 4 through 6, though anyone of any age can use this resource to begin their poetry-writing journey. The types of poems presented here are standard forms, ordered progressively to teach basic creative-writing and thinking skills, and to begin to build a vocabulary of common poetic terms that are useful especially in communicating with other poets. This book is the first in a three-part series that includes Book 2: Intermediate and Book 3: Advanced.",
