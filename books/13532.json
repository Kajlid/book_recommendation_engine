  "title": "Medusa: A Caitlin McHugh Mystery",
  "description": "\"Vengeance is a dish best served cold,\" and in the case confronting Lieutenant Caitlin McHugh of the Buchanan Police Department, it appears to be served in the cold shroud of concrete-encased corpses of rapists and philanderers. A woman calling herself \"Medusa\" is on a killing spree, and, like her namesake, is literally turning men to stone. When one of the victims turns out to be a rapist-murderer who had escaped their custody five years earlier, Caitlin and her team question their motivation for trying to capture his killer.",
