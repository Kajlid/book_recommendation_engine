  "title": "Temptation of Teresa",
  "description": "She's pure innocence. Due to her tragic past, Teresa has always wanted to become a nun; she longs for a life of quiet contemplation. Sins of the flesh terrify her and from what she's seen, passion only leads down into darkness. Every pleasure has its price. He's the essence of sin. A divinely diabolical wager sends the golden, handsome Dev to a remote monastery with one task - Teresa's complete seduction. If he fails, he spends the rest of his immortal life in hell. If he succeeds, it costs her soul. Seven days of temptation. One innocent maiden. One devilish incubus. Will she choose her immortal soul or the love of a lifetime?",
