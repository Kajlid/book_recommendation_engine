  "description": "She’s no stranger to saving the day in the courtroom, often helping women to escape their abusive spouses. But now New York divorce attorney Beth Scott is desperately in need of help herself. Upon returning home from work one day, she is brutally beaten, stabbed, and left for dead—with no memory of the assailant’s identity or the attack itself.  So when Detective Walter Stevens and his partner Rob Matthews set out to solve the crime, all they have are their suspicions and the input of Beth’s family and friends. Suspects soon emerge, but the case proves more complicated than the detectives imagined when threatening letters and secret codes point to the involvement of a dangerous criminal organization.  Meanwhile a recovering Beth finds herself facing conflicting emotions. Her ordeal rekindles an old flame—just as a potential new flame appears.  A testament to inner strength and the power of love, The Secondary Target captivates with equal parts romance and suspense—complex characters and a perplexing central mystery will keep readers hooked until the very end.",
