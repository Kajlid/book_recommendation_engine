This is just the opportunity the bad guys were looking for. When Maggie decides to do what is right vs. what is legal, the Association puts a bounty hunter on her tail to haul her off to prison.  Unfortunately, it comes to light that all of the World Walkers are being hauled off to prison... and once there, meeting an untimely end. Have the vampires infiltrated the World Walkers Association? Or is an even greater evil now at work?  Or is it just another lousy day at M&K Tracking?  WARNING: This book contains cussing, brawling, and unlady-like behavior. Proceed with caution.",
