  "description": "From #1 New York Times bestselling author Rachel Van Dyken comes a standalone new adult romance set in the competitive world of K-pop.It’s not all K-dramas and happily ever afters. Intern with Korea’s number one record label? Yes, please. Find out there’s a huge scandal I need to help “manage”… not so much. Add in the fact that I don’t recognize the “superstars” of the label and think they’re interns…And my dream job quickly becomes more of a nightmare.But I’m in Seoul, the one place that is beginning to feel more and more like home...Except it isn’t home, and the drama surrounding the biggest K-pop group in the world, SWT, is consuming my every moment. Spoiler alert. They hate me. Everything I do is wrong: wrong clothes, wrong honorifics, wrong manners. Till the leader of SWT takes pity on me.But pity is dangerous when it comes from someone as beautiful as him. Every SWT member is gorgeous, perfect, and cultivated to be an idol… lethal to a girl’s heart.And sanity. But fame plus a perfect face and voice don’t equal an easy life. As their comeback nears, the stakes rise higher. Suicide watch…Angry fans…Threats…All I want to do is survive. But the price for survival might mean losing my heart.And like a character in a K-drama, I’m not sure if there will be an actual happily ever after…Or simply a lesson learned.",
