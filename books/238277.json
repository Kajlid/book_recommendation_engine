  "title": "Wilderness: How to Marry Jesus in 10 Years or Less",
  "description": "How does a family of four, from middle class suburbia, wind up sleeping in a snowbank; in the dead of winter?Like you, Homer, Wanda, and their two daughters, were frustrated with stale religion; and wanted more of Jesus. Disturbed by the immaturity of Christians, and having a heart-felt longing for intimacy with Jesus, they followed Godâ€™s lead into the unknown. Their journey led them down the ancient paths of faith. A faith journey filled with painful realizations, humbling experiences, and life threatening situations. Buried in these pages lies a hidden map, that points to a deeper intimacy with Christ. If you throw yourself wholeheartedly into the hands of Jesus, as this family did, you may find this map; and its ultimate destination.",
