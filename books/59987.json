How could I ever forget him?Could I ever have him/her back again? Why do I always fall for the wrong person? Must I forgive him?How do I start again?Should we end a relationship even if we still love each other?Why isn't he trying harder like me?We wonder if we could ever survive such pain. We ask how such things could possibly happen to us. We want to know why despite all our efforts, we fail to heal our broken hearts. MEND MY BROKEN HEART is meant to guide you for 30 critical days with its rich words of wisdom, answering your deepest and most painful questions, and guiding you with powerful reflections and activities that are more than sufficient to fill your days ONE DAY of Healing AT A TIME. This book is a result of years of listening to real people who have real hurts and who struggle with the pain of not knowing how to heal a broken heart. This book has gathered the griefs of those who were brave enough to UNMASK how they really feel inside. We don't need another book that says we should get up on our feet and move on. We already know that, but we just don't know HOW. And most of all, we can't answer the nagging questions in our head that want us to find the MEANING to this darkness we are actually going through. WHY must things happen this way? What can all these mean? How could I ever make it through this? And who will be there to help me so that I may know I AM NOT ALONE? Does God really care?I sincerely pray for your healing, and may God guide you through these 30 days of intimacy and blessing with the One who truly Loves you and Cares for you. Know that you are not alone.",
