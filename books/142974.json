  "description": "Ivy LaRue didn’t intend on being happy when she moved to Sage Springs, Mo., but that’s exactly what happened. First, Eliza and Lexi wiggled in through the cracks of her carefully constructed defensive walls. Now her best friend, a spirit, is in the flesh thanks to mysterious circumstances. And Ivy can’t help but notice it’s some mighty fine flesh, which just adds another layer of complication to her life.  With only days to find a cure to keep her friend in human form, Ivy attempts to find the town's magical spring to save his life. While doing so, however, she must battle an unseen spirit who seems determined to make Ivy's life as difficult as possible. Assistance comes from unlikely places as she faces her past to attain the future she never thought she wanted.  Casting spells, dodging love and forming friendships soon make this snarky witch realize life is much more interesting than she ever imagined it could be.",
