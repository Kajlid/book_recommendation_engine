  "description": "In this disturbing new eBook novella by thriller master Damian Stevenson, a young woman with a history of mental illness descends into madness when her missing boyfriend is declared by all to be a figment of her imagination. Dana March is thrust into a game of shadows where nothing is what it seems and she must fight to preserve her own sanity in the face of overwhelming evidence that points to her having made up a story about an abduction. Dana’s sister recently married the charismatic leader of an experimental rural community, The Rainbow Collective, and Dana was on her way to visit with her new beau ‘Jack’ when he supposedly vanished from a roadside motel. Did Dana invent Jack to impress her sister? There is no trace of him and Dana is unable to produce any form of proof that he is real for the police. With no one to vouch for Jack’s existence, Dana must fight to preserve her grasp on reality while playing detective in an environment that suggests civilization is a thin veneer over man’s deepest, darkest impulses. ‘Solstice’ is a gripping, provocative page-turner that will leave you guessing the truth until the very end.",
