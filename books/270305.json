The mission of Islamic Hamas is to spread terror throughout the United States. Giti's late husband was working on a top secret project for California Robotics, when he was killed.

They team up with other members of NATA, including ex-Air Force Lieutenant Michelle Hough, to try and discover the plans of Jaffar and the Islamic Hamas, and how Giti is involved in the two.",
