  "title": "Slave to Love: Sexy Tales of Erotic Restraint",
  "description": "Restraint is sexy. It can be a simple leather strap, a shiny pair of handcuffs, a delicate silk scarf, or a dominant’s stern gaze. The yearning for a partner who will take control can grip one as powerfully as the most intricate, indecipherable rope knot. In Slave to Love, Alison Tyler gathers the most popular ― and often most taboo ― fantasies of sexual control and erotic restraint. Featuring such popular erotica writers as Thomas Roche, Saskia Walker, and Rachel Kramer Bussel, Slave to Love is luscious, naughty, and infinitely sexy.",
