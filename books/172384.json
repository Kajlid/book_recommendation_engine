  "description": "Even gone she was dominating his mind with her dark games, the wicked witch definitely not dead and gone for him. ‘I’m like the cowering lion missing courage, the scarecrow ripped apart with his brain gone, and the tin-man rusted with his heart stolen – just like in the Wizard of Oz. Why won’t she just melt away from my mind.’Catherine Everdene is an independent, stubborn career woman who likes attention and being in control. With the nickname ‘Icy Bitch’, she has a penchant for using her flirtatious sparkle to win over a boardroom. While heading up a company department in London, she meets stoical Dillon Oak and seduces his mind into complete domination. Her love-triangle starts in New York when she catches the attentions of the obsessive William Boldwood, the CEO of one of the DeChartine companies, and the real trouble starts when the charming alpha-male lawyer, Troy Selgent, sets his sights on winning her.Who will eventually win her heart? More to the point, who will survive to win her heart?Based on Thomas Hardy's original classic love story, Far From the Madding Crowd, Everdene is set in modern day London, New York and the countryside of Dorset (England). All of Hardy's original characters feature in Everdene, from the obsessive Boldwood to the dashing Troy, and as Catherine progresses in her career and her relationships, she learns more about herself and the dangers of her flirtations.A classic romance, re-told with erotic undertones of domination and submission, Everdene is an emotional journey of love, heartbreak, death and friendship.",
