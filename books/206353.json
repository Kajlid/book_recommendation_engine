  "description": "Chris Brooks grew up surrounded by animals. As a little girl, her best friend and guardian was a dog. Growing up, nothing changed. Over more than twenty years, she has adopted or rescued a pot pourri of dogs, from a three legged terrier to a ten stone rottweiler. This is the story of her journey through life with some of the mutts and mongrels who have shared it; from the tranquil to the timid, from the serene to the certifiable. Today, she lives in rural Spain with her three current dogs, cat and partner. She finds time for writing between working on her Mediterranean garden, renovating her Spanish finca, and perfecting marmalade.  \"Just finished this wonderful book, The Long, The Short and The Tall. A really good read for anyone, especially animal lovers, it has everything; comical in parts, gut wrenching in others & so sad you could cry. Christine's writing is awe inspiring, I felt as though I was actually there with her on her walks with her gang of four! I loved it & can't wait for September when her life with her fur babies continues....\"",
