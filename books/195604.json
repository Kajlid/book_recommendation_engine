  "title": "Mate For A Month",
  "description": "Silver Peaks is no place for a civilized shifter. One minute, city girl Eileen Pennyroyal is running in terror from a bear – so scared she even forgets that she can turn into a wolf. The next minute, she’s being rescued by the handsomest, rudest shifter she’s ever seen. Does Marcus even know how to speak, or does he just grunt when someone tries to make conversation? Eileen knows when she’s not wanted, and she thinks she’s never going to see him again – until the local Alpha tells her that Marcus needs a mate immediately. And it’s her. If she agrees, she’ll escape being forced into an arranged marriage with a hateful, abusive Alpha. But does marrying the hot-tempered, surly Marcus mean giving up on love forever? And can she show Marcus that he’s worth saving – before the dark forces that shaped him come back to claim him for good?",
