  "description": "In the strange and magical world of the Middle Realms, there are many diverse races of people that inhabit the lands. Humans, elves, dwarves, and plenty more civil creatures thrive on this planet. The different races are commonly viewed on a spectrum, and at the very ends of it, there are seraphs and demons. One exalted, and one feared. Every group in the middle of the gradient strives to be like the angels, as they are said to be pure-hearted and loving. Unfortunately, what people know about these beings almost always comes from what they have been taught rather than based on experience. Because of this, it is often preached that a person can only be either good or bad, and anything in between isn't relevant. It wasn't easy for Dacitrynn, who grew up in a very uncomfortable spot his whole life. Being a crossbreed of an angel and a demon isn't something that is welcomed in the world, especially since it is forbidden. After a lonely childhood of growing up as an outcast with the seraphs, it is finally time for Daci's life to change when he is banished from the High Lands following a public fight with his stepbrother that grew violent. However, even though Dacitrynn no longer lives with the angels, society below proves itself to be just as―if not even more cruel―than his birthplace, and hopelessness soon leaves him feeling defeated. Even if things eventually start to calm, there is always another stressor that makes its way into the half-demon's life, and at the end of the day, he can only find himself wandering back to the same two questions that have burdened him since the day of his birth: Is there truly a place for such a horrible monster like him in the world, and what use could his existence possibly serve?",
