  "description": "Please note, this is a Bisexual Dark RomanceMy name is Hanley Harper—for now—and I’m the anti-heroine of this story. Revenge is my fuel; it energizes me when I'm running on empty.  Elias Cari is a tool for retribution and the beginning of the new start. Unbeknownst to him, there is more to me than I will ever show him. He will know exactly who I am when it’s too late—when I’m done with him.  I'm quickly closing in on the the perfect place to avenge the crimes committed against my family. The place where Elias is least likely to expect an enemy to be. Beneath him.  A problem hits me unexpectedly. Elias has become a welcome addiction, and I've become his obsession. He won't stop exerting control over me until I've become his exclusive possession.  How can so many things go wrong and feel so right?  My plan is damned…or is it?  Content contains violence, graphic sex, coarse language, and scenes that some readers may find objectionable. Reader discretion is advised.",
