  "description": "Justice & Peace introduces college students and concerned Christians to the complex challenges of our current global situation and helps them understand the role of ethics in the face of dramatic changes taking place in the world in this last decade of the twentieth century. What answers does the lens of Christian social ethics reveal about global issues - violence and conflict within and among nations, human suffering caused by poverty, discrimination and exploitation, and the need for political and economic justice?Written in an accessible style, Justice & Peace is designed as a text for undergraduates in a variety of Christian ethics courses (such as Christian Social Justice, War and Peace, Ethics and Foreign Policy, Catholic Social Teaching, Christian Social Ethics). It is also appropriate for study groups exploring issues of global justice, and will inform clergy and educated Christians of all denominations - especially Catholics.",
