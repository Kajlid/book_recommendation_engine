  "title": "Proofs & Theories: Essays on Poetry",
  "description": "Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature Proofs and Theories , winner of the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for First Non-Fiction,   is an illuminating collection of essays by Louise Glück, one of this country's most brilliant poets. Like her poems, the prose of Glück, who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1993 for The Wild Iris , is compressed, fastidious, fierce, alert, and absolutely unconsoled. The force of her thought is evident everywhere in these essays, from her explorations of other poets' work to her skeptical contemplation of current literary critical notions such as \"sincerity\" and \"courage.\" Here also are Glück's revealing reflections on her own education and life as a poet, and a tribute to her teacher and mentor, Stanley Kunitz.  Proofs and Theories  is not a casual collection. It is the testament of a major poet.",
