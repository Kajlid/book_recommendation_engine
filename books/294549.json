  "description": "Heartfelt and hilarious, this is a book for anyone who has tried to imagine what their dog was thinking.Human beings often write about their dogs, but the dogs don't usually get a right of reply. In Love, Clancy, Richard Glover has collated the letters sent by Clancy to his parents in the bush. They are full of a young dog's musings about the oddities of human behaviour, life in the big city, and his own attempts to fit in. You'll meet Clancy as a puppy, making his first attempt to train his humans, then see him grow into a mature activist, demanding more attention be paid to a dog's view of the world. Along the way, there are adventures aplenty, involving robotic vacuum cleaners, songs about cheese, trips to the country and stolen legs of ham - all told with a dog's deep wisdom when it comes to what's important in life.With delightful illustrations by cartoonist Cathy Wilcox.PRAISE FOR RICHARD GLOVER\nThe Land Before Avocado\n'This is vintage Glover - warm, wise and very, very funny.
