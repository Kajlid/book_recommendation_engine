Robert has learned his lesson messing with fated mates. He’s also learned he’ll never carry on the family name like his parents expect. They might be fated mates, but Blake’s close-minded pack council resists the mated male pair. Complications arise from a she-wolf who’s set her sights on being the Alpha mate—and on Blake. And Robert’s fears might ruin everything. Can love win? Or will life tear them apart?",
