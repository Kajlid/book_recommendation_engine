  "description": "He had a right to remain suffocated by his pain.She had a right to remain silent about hers.For better or for worse. Those were the vows that I had taken with my wife six years ago. We had lived through the better and were barely getting through the worse. I tried to face our loss together, while she chose to have an affair instead.Time apart was what we both needed.What I didn’t expect in that time was her.The beauty she possessed on the outside was a far cry from the scars she was harboring on the inside. She wasn’t looking for love and neither was I. She just needed someone to help her deal with the pain she had been carrying around for the past two years, and I was happy to oblige.I wasn’t supposed to fall in love with her, but suddenly I was seeing a future that I never dreamed of right in front of my eyes….only to find that the past had other things in mind for us. ***I always believed that we only got one true love in life, and mine was gone and never coming back.Through the tear-filled nights and never ending days, I was slowly and tortuously coming to terms with the pain that was my reality.And then he entered my life.Tall, handsome, genuine and caring, he was a friend when I needed one most. Together, we were a temporary fix to our own permanent pain. Just two people helping each other to get through a very dark period in life.But when the light begins to shine ever so slightly with each passing day, and his face is all I can see at the end of that tunnel…..do I run back into the darkness or move into the light with him?",
