  "description": "50% boobs. 50% sarcasm. 100% new breed of hunter.After a bumpy start as the only female demon hunter in the top secret Brotherhood of David, Nava heads to Prague for her first undercover mission: unmasking a demon movie star. She’d be all kinds of thrilled if it weren’t for the fact that her fellow hunter-with-benefits, Rohan, has reclaimed his rock star status and assigned Nava the role of groupie.Rejecting her “be a good girl and follow orders” directive, Nava unleashes an alter ego guaranteed to hook their celebrity target and drive Rohan crazy. No downside–until she finds herself up against Rohan’s past, the Brotherhood’s antiquated thinking, and her own identity issues, turning her personal life into a bomb that could blow up the entire operation. Sparkly and deadly; it’s a plan.",
