  "description": "When Granger Blue signed on as a drover for the Lazy J, he expected to suffer all the hardships involved in riding herd across the wild, dust-choked plains from Nebraska to Oregon. What he didn-t expect was temptation in the form of a young greenhorn with cornflower blue eyes named Billy Bower. With as many secrets as heads of cattle, the drive may turn out to be the most dangerous of Granger-s life as he works to bring the herd in with his skin -- and heart -- intact.",
