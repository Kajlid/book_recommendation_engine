  "title": "The Bartender",
  "description": "Olive is a Los Angeles bartender who has been unlucky in love. She hopes that will change when one of the best-looking men she's ever seen walks into her bar. But he’s not what he seems.   Austin is tall, charismatic, and compellingly attractive. But unbeknownst to the smitten Olive, Austin is not dating her for her beauty, but merely for her usefulness. He and his childhood friend have set a depraved plan in motion.   Becca is a grifter and a con-artist looking for her one big score. She’s found out that Olive’s boss has hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash at his house in the Pacific Palisades. Becca will do anything to make it hers.  Olive becomes the unknowing intermediary and Austin her willing co-conspirator, but both are instruments in Becca’s orchestration. She will stop at nothing to get what she wants. Not even murder.   The Bartender is a twisting, multi-narrative thriller told through the eyes of a brave heroine and unforgettable villains: Olive, the strong but innocent young woman dragged into something sinister. Austin, sensing this will all end horribly, but without the gumption to stop it. And Becca, dollar signs dancing in her eyes, with no regard for human life.",
