  "title": "Canonical Theism: A Proposal for Theology and the Church",
  "description": "The bold thesis of  Canonical Theism  is that the good and life-giving Holy Spirit has equipped the church not only with a canon of scripture but also with an abundant canonical heritage of materials, persons, and practices. However, much of the latter has been ignored or cast aside. The authors call for the retrieval and redeployment of the full range of this rich legacy. Voices from across the spectrum here chart that mine of opportunity and invite the entire church to explore the benefits of their discoveries.Ambitious in its scope and agenda,  Canonical Theism  offers insights that will enable the readers to discover anew the faith that has nourished converts, created saints, and upheld martyrs across the years.William J.
