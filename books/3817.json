  "title": "Economics in One Lesson",
  "description": "This book has been the springboard from which millions have come to understand the basic truths about economics--and the economic fallacies responsible for inflation, unemployment, high taxes, and recession. H.L. Mencken called Hazlitt \"one of the few economists in human history who could really write.\" Nobel Laureate F.A. Hayek hailed this book as \"a brilliant performance.\"\"If there were a Nobel Prize for clear economic thinking, Mr. Hazlitt's book would be a worthy recipient... like a surgeon's scalpel, it cuts through... much nonsense that has been written in recent years about our economic ailments.\" -- John W. Hanes, former Undersecretary of the Treasury",
