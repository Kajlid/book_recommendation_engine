  "description": "Aliens invade Key West during the island’s annual fantasy festival! Pamela Buchanan’s vacation goes south in a terrifying way. A handsome muscle-bound guy in a sexy barbarian costume rescues her. She finds him irresistible, but can’t believe her eyes when sharp blades emerge from his arms. Her private fantasy turns monstrously real when the demented alien claims she’s his mate and takes her to his spaceship.  Kord, a Tauran warrior, is part of a landing party sent to spy on Krellian slave traders. When a human female runs into him, literally, his body instantly recognizes that she’s his mate. Time isn’t on his side, but he’ll do everything he can to win her affection and trust before he’s overcome by claiming lust, a primal urge so strong he can’t resist.",
