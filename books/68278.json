  "title": "Watchman's Oath",
  "description": "Never tell anyone what you can do. . . . Lynet had already decided to leave, when the Watchman came thundering into the valley, on errand from the king, to discover the truth of the rumors: “A plaga norn has come to Norðrlönd, a plague witch who brings only death.” Lynet could have escaped, could have plucked the life from his strong, beating heart. Chance stayed her hand and a vague hope that the battle-honed Watchman could help her tame her ruinous magic. Together they become outlaws, staying one step ahead of the king’s men—until misplaced trust rips Lynet away and sends her hurtling across the barrier that divides Norðrlönd from the modern, non-magic Outside world. Stranded in Buffalo, New York, Lynet has no memory of the Watchman or of her devastating power—and no memory of the dangerous stranger who hints that he can restore her memories and take her home—for a price. Watchman's Oath is an epic fantasy full of Celtic history and Viking myth, romance, magic, demon monsters, pixie bugs that control time, and savage battles of fire and ice. Romantic sword and sorcery at its best.",
