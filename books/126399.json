  "title": "4 Chair Discipling: Growing a Movement of Disciple-Makers",
  "description": "Dann Spader is a disciple-maker who has spent his adult life exploring what it means to take someone from being a seeker to making disciples themselves. Over 750,000 people in 80 countries have been trained to make disciples through organizations he has led. Through studying the life of Christ and His disciple-making methods, Dann developed 4 Chair Discipling, a simple picture for others to follow. Jesus’ last words on earth had a few very specific instructions: Go, make disciples, baptize, and teach.But what does that mean for us today? Well, it’s not easy. But it is simple. Teacher and leader Dann Spader explains disciple-making as a process of moving people through four chairs, from someone seeking to know more about Christ to someone who makes disciples themselves. Chair 1: Come and See (John 1:39)Chair 2: Follow Me (John 1:43)Chair 3: Become a Fisher of Men (Matthew 4:19)Chair 4: Go and Bear Fruit (John 15:16) In the process of His four-year ministry, Jesus realized that different people are at different stages of growth and development, and He works to challenge each of them to the next level. In 4 Chair Discipling , you’ll get a clear and simple picture of how to follow in Jesus’ footsteps and do the same thing.",
