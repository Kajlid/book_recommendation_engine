  "description": "The Rail City was originally published on amazon as the first part of The Rail City Chronicles. It's currently been taken off the market in anticipation of a major new edition, completely rewritten, with all new art, and will be rereleased under the anticipated title The Rail City. Because there was never a print edition, this particular edition no longer exists, though it was technically published, read, and reviewed by a select few. The author is taking advantage of the electronic medium, to respond to the wishes and criticisms of his readers, for whom he writes.",
