  "description": "\"I was born with skins too few. Or they were scrubbed off me by...robust and efficient hands.\"The experiences absorbed through these \"skins too few\" are evoked in this memoir of Doris Lessing's childhood and youth as the daughter of a British colonial family in Persia and Southern Rhodesia Honestly and with overwhelming immediacy, Lessing maps the growth of her consciousness, her sexuality, and her politics, offering a rare opportunity to get under her skin and discover the forces that made her one of the most distinguished writers of our time.",
