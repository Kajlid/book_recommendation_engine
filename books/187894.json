  "description": "Adele Sullivan doesn't mind her job as a waitress at the Fat Dragon sushi bar. It pays the bills while she tries to make a name for herself as an artist. Of course, it helps that there's a ridiculously handsome Japanese accountant who comes in once a week to do the books. Adele's had her eye on him for some time.  Kaito Araki is a mystery to Adele. He's polite, reserved, and doesn't seem to be interested in her at all. Until one night, when she witnesses an act of unexpected violence, revealing a darker side to the man. It seems Kaito isn't who he pretends to be. Who is this complicated man, really?  Adele finds herself thrust into LA's seedy underworld, where hostesses, pimps and gangsters swim like sharks beneath the glittering surface, and the yakuza are trying to expand their territory.  She's still not sure where Kaito fits into it all. What she can't ignore, however, is the growing attraction between them. Is getting to know Kaito really a good idea, or is she going to end up burnt?  Adele had better hope her instincts are right on this one.  This book is recommended for readers aged 18 and over. It contains violence, swearing and steamy sex scenes.",
