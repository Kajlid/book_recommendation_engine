  "description": "The house is full of Mustangs, and the Wild Horse Compound, now affectionately referred to as Mustang Ranch, is only a few weeks away from completion. There is a feeling of security, yet not—Teresa’s anxiety attacks seem to disregard logic. Thankfully, the Team Red detail understands and supports her as she battles unseen demons.  Marcia and Wes have moved to Spokane, and the cancer vigil begins; her final wish is to see her son celebrate his 10th birthday. Compassionate friends, Janey, Ken, Tara, and Jason, take over Marcia’s care in an effort to relieve stress as Teresa wages her struggle against PTSD nightmares and paranoia. Tank bonds with Wes as the sad young boy watches his mom slip away.  Bastian is at an undisclosed East Coast location doing PreClan military software upgrades. At home, David is exerting subtle, yet unrelenting pressure to give him a second chance. Will David's obsessive behavior completely destroy the tenuous balance of his relationship with her and Bas?  Teresa takes comfort in Red’s constant and supportive presence. His antics and doggy wisdom keep her smiling as she waits not-so-patiently for Bastian to return.  WELCOME TO TEAM RED! This version of the series is INTENDED FOR MATURE ADULTS OVER 18. Blind-sided contains graphic sexual content, and swearing, which is unfortunate as the dog repeats everything.  NOTE: Blind-sided is a novella, 25,000+ words. Your purchase also includes, Blush, a novella previously published in the Shades of Pink, Vol. 2 Anthology-- this story has been expanded.",
