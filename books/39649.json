  "description": "The beloved sequel to the bestselling classic,  Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume II presents more fantastic step-by-step French recipes for home cooks.Working from the principle that “mastering any art is a continuing process,” Julia Child and Simone Beck gathered together a brilliant selection of new dishes to bring you to a yet higher level of culinary mastery.They have searched out more of the classic dishes and regional specialties of France, and adapted them so that Americans, working with American ingredients, in American kitchens, can achieve the incomparable flavors and aromas that bring up a rush of memories—of lunch at a country inn in Provence, of an evening at a great Paris restaurant, of the essential cooking of France.From French bread to salted goose, from peasant  ragoûts  to royal Napoleons, recipes are written with the same detail, exactness, and clarity that are the soul of  Mastering the Art of French Cooking .",
