  "description": "Songs written for Disney productions since the 1930s to the present day have become a potent part of American popular culture. Since most Americans first discovered these songs in their youth, the songs have a special place in one's consciousness. Songwriters and original singers are identified, as well as the source of the song and other venues in which it has been used over the years. This volume also contains a glossary of song terms, a songwriter's directory, a guide to recordings and DVDs of Disney productions, and a listing of Academy Award nominees and winners.",
