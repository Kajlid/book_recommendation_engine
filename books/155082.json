  "description": "(A Short Story) Landon Brinkley is twenty-four years old and she’s never been on a real date. That’s mostly because she’s been working so hard on her dreams she hasn’t had time to bother with men. But then Brody Ashton walked into her life and since he looks like an underwear model (but you know, with clothes on) it was kind of impossible not to take notice. So Landon and Brody are dating now, or really, beginning to. It’s all very new and exciting and there’s only one problem… they still haven’t gone on a real date. So that’s what tonight is supposed to be; magical, romantic, expensive… and it's about to go horribly wrong.Party Girl’s First Date is a novella that continues the love story of Landon and Brody where it left off in Party Girl. It’s sweet and funny and, get this, absolutely FREE on Smashwords. This novella is a gift to you readers, a massive thank you to those of you who read Party Girl and are waiting patiently for book #2 to come out in May. Hopefully this cute little smooch-fest will hold you over until Max gets her HEA in book two! xo, Rachel",
