And as this boy's payback continues, he's forced to evaluate and change his behavior. When he finally does, both he and the reader learn the difference between bully behavior and true leadership. Karmack is a whimsical yet thought-provoking story for children ages 8 to 12. Elementary school teachers should find this a good read-aloud as well.",
