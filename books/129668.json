  "title": "A Fool for Nature",
  "description": "A finely wrought poetry collection at the price of a cup of trendy coffee; this is a set of poems which may increase your sense of connection to nature. To know - if you didn't already - that you are one with nature. The topics vary a lot. Yes there are plenty of trees, birds, fields, stars and various animal vignettes, but some of these poems get quite philosophical about the nature of things: DNA, free will, ancient Chinese sages, seizing the day, the paradox of seeking wisdom and the importance of silliness. The book title comes from one of the poems, and it's a reference to the song: 'Fool on the hill' by John Lennon and Paul McCartney.Poems:1 A tree and the stars 2 Nature 3 The Bristlecone's not Pining4 A fool for nature5 Camera6 Sleepy cat in a mountain village7 Life's music plays in DNA8 Grasp the nettle9 Kongzi and the hunchback10 Master Chuang 11 Unsung heroes of ancient times 12 Free as the wind 13 Processology (A bogus definition) 14 Geronimo!15 Buried Treasure 16 Owl in winter 17 Follow whose myth?18 Idle thoughts 19 Some foolishness! 20 On writing poetry",
