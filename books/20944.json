  "title": "Guido Cavalcanti: Complete Poems",
  "description": "Guido Cavalcanti (c. 1250-1300) of Florence was one of the first to create a new style of poetry, the \"dolce stil nuovo,\" that was to inspire Dante. Cavalcanti's poetry sings of relationship and the metaphors of love that transcend the sexual and the romantic. Cirigliano's sensitive and probing text breaks with the Victorianisms of Rossetti's and Pound's translations in offering the contemporary reader the full passion of this master in a verse that is both elegant and direct. Includes introduction, notes, and first-line index. Dual-language poetry.",
