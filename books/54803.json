The Swastika has been replaced by the Hammer and Sickle, the soldiers by secret police, but a life of daily oppression and fear remains. Inspired by the memory of Joseph Schumacher, his widow forms a contentious coalition to sneak six disabled young people over the Berlin Wall, out of Communist East Germany, and on to either freedom or capture.",
