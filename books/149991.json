  "description": "About ten years ago, I started defining objectives for myself. I began by just writing down what I wanted to accomplish on a piece of paper. I noticed soon after that this wasn’t very effective. I would write them down on paper, set the paper aside, and I’d remember after a few months. I needed a system that would ensure that my objectives became reality. Over the years, I have tested several systems for organizing and achieving my objectives. I had breakdowns, surrenders, resumptions, and tactical changes. I resorted to the most diverse strategies. Today, after ten years of tests and experiments, I have my own system that offers a rate of success of over 90 percent. There are still instances when I fail, but I can say that I manage pretty well. My vision for this book was to provide a system for organizing time and personal objectives, constructed around annual objectives. A good system of organization does not guarantee success, unless you also work to transform it into reality. In other words, this book will not do the work for you. But, with this book in your hand, the most thrilling part is just about to start.",
