  "description": "No one, seeing them together,could possibly think, “Good idea.”DESTINEDFordI’ve been hung up on my twin sister’s best friend since kindergarten. Reluctantly, I let her go and stopped looking for a replacement. What are the odds a guy still in high school could be struck by lightning twice?Then Eren Sanchez steamrolled into me—my car, her truck. It was completely her fault. Now, her father is making her act as my driver until my car is fixed. We might not survive that long. She’s infuriating, a pain, and grumpy. I’m torn between flicking her hard on her forehead with my finger . . . and kissing her.Where did that come from?ErenBeing the only girl in a house full of guys has taught me a lot about men. I can eat just as fast, tune an engine, change your oil, and lay you out in a heartbeat if you cross any lines. I’m not a first-degree blackbelt for nothing.Still, being one of the guys isn’t the same as being *with* a guy. This is new. And slightly terrifying. But what’s the first rule in any fight? Never let them know you’re scared. That probably applies to . . . er, other things as well.Bluff until you’re tough. Or enough. Weird that I suddenly care about that. I never have before.Looking for love in all the wrong places? This enemies-to-lovers, opposites-attract romp will have you laughing out loud and swooning in secret. Dive into Book 3 in the hilariously fun Dryden High Sweet series by Randi Rigby.",
