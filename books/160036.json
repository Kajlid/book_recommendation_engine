  "description": "Life's a witch...and then you die. It's the dying part vexing Bay Winchester these days. She may be a long-suffering daughter, thankless newspaper editor, and keyed-up girlfriend, but she's barely holding off a royal freakout. Landon's family is visiting the inn -- and they're not exactly open minded. Bay is on a mission to hide her witchy ways, but the discovery of a body -- and the poltergeist that accompanies it -- at The Overlook tips everything into turmoil. Landon's mother doesn't trust them -- and his Aunt Blanche is moving in on Aunt Tillie's man (which is causing more trouble than anyone saw coming). That's on top of the paranormal havoc the poltergeist is wreaking in every corner of town. Bay and Thistle are convinced Aunt Tillie knows something about the body the construction company unearthed while erecting her beloved greenhouse. The problem is, she won't admit it. Landon is on vacation. Chief Terry is on edge. Clove is hiding something -- and it has nothing to do with the poltergeist. That's on top of the fact that Bay's mom and aunts are feigning eternal ignorance. The poltergeist is out for blood, though -- and it will only settle for Winchester blood. When everything comes to a head, a long-held Hemlock Cove secret will be unveiled -- and it's not what anyone is expecting.",
