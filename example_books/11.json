  "description": "A mother and daughter of Puerto Rican and Jewish ancestry, the Moraleses express their radical and feminist views in diary-like poetry and prose that echo the rhetoric of the '60s. Yet the mixed origins of this pair lend an international, even universal feeling to the sentiments. They seem to speak for many women of many places and times. Titles of their pieces include \"Concepts of Pollution,\" \"Distress Signals,\" \"Getting Out Alive,\" \"Class Poem\" and \"I Am the Reasonable One.\" Both authors are literary, serious, socially concerned and passionate, and their anger is about injustices that plague them and other people. There is much vivid imagery and heartfelt emotion, and the reader may well long for causes that stir them as these women are stirred. Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
