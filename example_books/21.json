  "description": "Some of Fantagraphics’ most demanded reprints bring back Crumb’s earlier work, from his pre-Underground days to the adventures of Fritz the Cat. These early volumes of our multiple Harvey and Eisner Award-winning Complete Crumb Comics series have been amongst our most demanded reprints the last few years. Following last season’s reprint of the expanded Vol. 1, the first three volumes of this best-selling series will all be in print for the first time in a decade! “Starring Fritz the Cat” includes the stories that began to build the Crumb legend: the original Fritz stories from Harvey Kurtzman’s Help! magazine in 1965, plus much rare art, some of Crumb’s long-lost American Greeting cards from the ’60s, and more. Plus, the story of Crumb’s first acid trip! Yes",
