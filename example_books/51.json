  "description": "GRISTLE FROM FACTORY FARMS TO FOOD SAFETY (Thinking Twice About The Meat We Eat) THINK TWICE! An information-packed, lively, and informative little guide, Gristle is for the growing number of people - from meat-eaters to vegetarians - who are thinking twice about the perils of our system of animal processing and factory farms. Multiplatinum musician Moby and leading food policy activist and expert Miyun Park have brought together ten of the country's leading voices on this issue - including foodies, policy makers, food business leaders, and food activists - who together eloquently lay out how and why the overconsumption of industrially produced meat unnecessarily harms agricultural workers, communities, the environment, and human health, as well as animals. Combining hard-hitting facts with a light touch - and with fascinating charts and illustrations depicting the stark realities of America's industrial food system - Gristle is the first stop for everyone who wants to make informed choices about the food they consume.",
